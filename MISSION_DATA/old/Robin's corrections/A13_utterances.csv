-35:17:28|||Counting down to launch
-04:49:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T minus 3 hours, 49 minutes, 57 seconds and counting. We've received word now from the crew quarters that Colnel Tom Stafford of the astronaut office is in fact ... the prime crew right as scheduled .. 58 AM. From there the crew proceeded to the area where they will receive their brief physicals this morning. There, Dr. John Teegan and Dr. Alan Harder from the Manned Spacecraft Center, Launch Site Medial Operations Branch will give them their brief physicals. From the physical they will - where they are right now, they'll report down for their breakfast. It will be the traditional breakfast of steak and eggs. In the meantime, the launch crew has completed the liquid hydrogen loading, which completes cryogenic loading. From now on we will be in the replenish mode with both, liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen being replenished down to the final minutes of the countdown. Just a few moments ago we had an updated weather briefing. The weather appears to be satisfactory for launch. The chances of rain seem to be diminishing at this time. There is a stationary front over the Florida / Georgia coast which is bringing in a considerable amount of cloud cover. We'll be expecting temperatures of about 80 degrees fahrenheit at launch time, winds 12 knots from the southeast, and clouds - several cloud layers; one layer from 3,500 to 5,000 feet, another scattered layer at 8 to 9,000, a broken layer at 14,000, and still another cloud cover at 20 to 25,000. These clouds are acceptable for launch. At T-minus 3 hours, 48 minutes, 13 seconds, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-04:29:58|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; now T minus 3 hour, 30 minutes and holding. This is a planned, built-in hold built into the count at this time, scheduled to last for 1 hour. Going into our hold, the launch team here in the Launch Control Center actually is running a little bit ahead of schedule. Cryogenic loading has been completed and the close-out crew is now on their way out to the spacecraft to make it ready for the arrival of Commander, Jim Lovell, Command Module Pilot, Jack Swigart, and Lunar Module Pilot, Fred Haise. The three crewmen have just completed their physical examination - a brief physical examination, this morning back at the crew quarters. Dr. Teegan reported, "All three men were in real fine shape in this morning's exam. They're in top shape for the mission." Now T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes and holding, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-04:19:58|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; we're continuing in our hold at the T minus 3 hour and 30 minute mark. This is a planned hold at this time scheduled to last for 1 hour. The close-out crew has just recently arrived at the 320 foot level. They went across the swingarm to the white room area and have now opened the hatch of the Command Module, which has been named "Odyssey". The backup pilot, Vance Brand, has entered the spacecraft at this time. The close-out crew consists of 6 men. The pad leader, the backup pilot (Vance Brand), a NASA quality control man, two spacecraft technicians, and a suit technician - two suit technicians. The crew busily at work now preparing the Command Module to receive the crew when they're ready to come out. The crew sitting down for breakfast now, they're getting their traditional breakfast of steak and eggs. Actually, getting tenderloin steak, eggs, orange juice, coffee, jelly and toast for breakfast this morning. Continuing in our hold at 3 hours, 30 minutes and holding, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-04:04:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; we're continuing in our planned hold at the 3 hour and 30 minutes at this time. The crew is finishing up their breakfast at this time. They had some guests for breakfast: Dr. Anthony England (an astronaut), Colonel Tom Stafford, and Donald K. Slayton. Prior to going to breakfast this morning, the crew had a short physical. Dr. John Teegan (and that's spelled Teegan) reported, "All three men were in real fine shape in this morning's exam. They're in top shape for the mission." At this time, up at the spacecraft level at Launch Complex 39A, the close-out crew is busily at work with Backup Pilot, Vance Brand in the spacecraft going through a varity of checks. He'll spend about 25 minutes in the spacecraft. Once he got into the craft, he turned on the Caution and Warning system, and then began to prepare the water system - this is the drinking water system aboard the spacecraft. He injected chlorine into the system, and operated the water gun. There are a variety of lights on the spacecraft panels which he is, at this time, turning off. He'll also be adjusting the oxygen - this is the breathing oxygen which the crew will use. Also, over some of the switches, above the couches are some safety locks so the switches can't be inadvertently turned on. He's taking off some of these safety switches, now and generally making the spacecraft ready for the arrival of the prime crew. Actually, prior to cryogenic loading, late yesterday astronaut, Brand accompanied by astronaut, Tony England went into the spacecraft and went through a spacecraft checklist of checking the various switches and circuit breakers. Our countdown in a hold - in a planned hold, at the T-minus 3 hours, 30 minute mark, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-03:49:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; we're continuing to hold at the 3 hour and 30 minute mark as planned. We have approximately 20 more minutes remaining in this built-in hold. Stoney, which is the capsule communicator - which is the callsign for the capsule communicator here in the Launch Control Center has just checked in. This is astronaut, Paul White. Also checking in have been the spacecraft test conductor and the launch vehicle test conductor indicating that they're ready for the crew when the crew is ready to depart. Astronauts Haise, Lovell, and Swigert (in that order) entered the suit room just a few moments ago and began the suiting operation. If they stay on schedule, as they have been this morning, they'll be departing from the crew quarters at approximately 11:07am for the trip out to the pad. Countdown continuing to go well at this time as we remain in our hold at the T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes and holding, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-03:34:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; we're now about 5 minutes away from resuming our countdown at the T-minus 3 hour, 30-minute mark. At this time, the astronaut crew are in the suit room donning their spacesuits back at the Manned Spacecraft Operations building on Kennedy Space Center. The closeout crew at the pad rapidly preparing the spacecraft and the white room area to receive the crew. Cryogenic loading was completed before entering this built-in hold. We continue to top off these extremely cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen at this time, and will continue to top off down to the final minutes of the countdown. Also going on at this time are some computer checks. These are check to ensure that the computers here on the ground are properly communicating with the computers aboard the space vehicle, and the proper reactions do take place to the signals being sent. Countdown going well at this time. We'll be standing by to resume the count in approximately 4 minutes from this time. T-minus 3 hours, 30 minutes and holding, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-03:19:28|P|PAO|... - coming out to the pad at approximately 11:07am EST. It's about an 8 mile ride out to the pad from the crew quarters, and that's expected to take some 15 to 20 minutes. Our weather for a 2:13pm EST launch continues to be satisfactory. Although it looks quite sunny at the space center at this time, we do expect some clouds to move in and expect the cloud cover at approximately 25 - 2,500 to 5,000 feet. However, these cloud covers will not ... any type of deterent to our launch. The winds are expected to be approximately 12 knots from the southeast; temperature will be a warm 80 degrees; and no rain is expected at launch time. Our countdown continuing to move nicely at this time. T-minus 3 hours, 18 minutes, 35 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-03:07:48|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T-minus 3 hours, 7 minutes, 46 seconds and counting. And at this time the crew has left the suit room and is now entering the transfer van. Apollo 13 Commander, Jim Lovell; Command Module Pilot, Jack Swigert; and Lunar Module Pilot, Fred Haise are now in the transfer van, and they'll start that 8 mile trip out to the launch pad. At the pad we just heard from astronaut, Vance Brand. He has completed all his functions inside the spacecraft and is now awaiting the arrival of the prime crew. The pad leader also reported back that he is ready - they're read in the the white room, and in the spacecraft to receive the crew. Now T-minus 3 hours, 7 minutes, 9 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-02:44:28|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T-minus 2 hours, 44 minutes, 26 seconds and counting. Donald K. Slayton, now in the firing room has indicated that when he was with the crew this morning they were in good spirits and appeared to be completely ready for their flight. The crew in the white room - the close-out crew is now standing by waiting for the prime crew - the astronaut crew to arrive at the 320 foot level. Once they arrive - once the elevator arrives at that level, the two astronauts, Lovell and Haise will come across the swingarm. And they're coming across now. They arrived at the 320 foot level, and astronaut Lovell is the first one to come across. Lovell will be followed by Haise and one suit technitian, the other suit technician will remain in the elevator with the Command Module Pilot, Jack Swigert.
-02:43:39|P|PAO|The two men, now are entering the white room and they'll now prepare for the ingress. The first one to enter the spacecraft will be the spacecraft Commander, Jim Lovell. He'll move in to the center seat and over to the far lefthand seat. The second one to go in will be the Lunar Module Pilot, Fred Haise who will move into the center seat and then across into the right-hand seat. At that time the Command Module Pilot, Jack Swigert and a suit technician will come across from their standby position in the elevator, and Swigert will move into the center seat. The crew now preparing for the ingress at T-minus 2 hours and 43 minutes and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-02:35:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T-minus 2 hours, 34 minutes, 57 seconds and counting. At this time the spacecraft Commander, Jim Lovell is aboard the spacecraft, which they have decided to call "Odyssey". Lovell made a communications check just moments ago, asked if he could hear he said, "I can read you loud and clear." He actually entered the spacecraft at 11:32. We have Haise just finishing entering the spacecraft. He moved into the spacecraft at 11:38 and will now be moving over into the right-hand seat. Before entering the spacecraft, the men removed their protective covers which are over their boots. They've been wearing those since they donned their spacesuits this morning. After they move into the couch they get a communications check and hook up to the oxygen, check that out, and then the portable oxygen ventilator is handed out of the spacecraft. As they entered, the Backup Pilot, Vance Brand is at the rear of the spacecraft, assisting them as they get in ...
-02:31:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T-minus 2 hours, 30 minutes, 58 seconds and counting. The pad leader indicated that he was now ready for the Command Module Pilot, Jack Swigert to come aboard and, in fact Swigert has now walked across the swingarm with a suit technician and is in the white room area preparing to ingress the spacecraft. Now with Swigert and the suit technician there we have a total of 9 men, including the three astronauts and 6 of the close-out crew in the white room area. This is the maximum that we'll have in there during this close-out period. Now T-minus 2 hours, 30 minutes, 26 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-02:28:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T-minus 2 hours, 28 minutes, 54 seconds and counting. And the last of the three astronauts, the Command Module Pilot, Jack Swigert has now gone aboard the spacecraft. We logged him going over the sil at 11:44am EST. Communications check has been established now with both, the spacecraft Commander, Jim Lovell, and the Lunar Module Pilot, Fred Haise. Now T-Minus 2 hours, 28 minutes, 29 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-02:19:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T-minus 2 hours, 19 minutes, 57 seconds and counting. At this time, the spacecraft test conductor is going over some switch check positions with the crew inside the spacecraft. Verifying that when they go into the spacecraft they didn't inadvertently trip some of these switches and get them into the wrong position. We have relatively clear skies at Kennedy Space Center at this time, however within the next couple of hours by our 2:13pm EST launch time we're expecting to have some clouds moving in but we do not expect them to be any kind of a problem for our launch today. Earlier worries about rain have disappeared at this time, we're not expecting any rain. The temperatures are expected to be about 80 degrees fahrenheit, winds 12 knots from the southeast. Now T-Minus 2 hours, 19 minutes, 9 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-02:15:32|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T-minus 2 hours, 15 minutes, 30 seconds and counting. At this time, the spacecraft test conductor, Skip Chauvin just called to the pad leader indicating that the checkouts have been complete. Once they get Vance Brand, the backup pilot out - and he appears to be coming out at this time. They are cleared to begin closing the hatch - begin closing the hatch on the Command Module called "Odyssey". Our countdown moving ... ahead of schedule at this time. At 2 hours, 15 minutes, 5 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-02:12:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're T-minus 2 hours, 12 minutes, 23 seconds and counting. At this time, Vance Brand, the backup pilot is out and the pad leader has just received permission to begin closing the hatch. As they close the hatch they will begin to purge the cabin which has been - being fed with fresh air from a large hose in the white room. They'll purge the cabin and bring aboard pressurization with a 60/40 mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. The crew inside will continue, of course, to breath from their oxygen system aboard the spacecraft. Now T-minus 2 hours, 11 minutes, 49 seconds and counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-01:29:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; we're at T-minus 1 hour, 29 minutes, 57 seconds and counting. Finishing up at this time is the checks of the Emergency Detection System. Skip Chauvin, the Test Supervisor, now also making some - he's Spacecraft Test Supervisor - making some checks with the various members of the team - launch crew inside the spacecraft. The Boost Protective Cover has now come closed. This is the cover which will protect the spacecraft hatch both from the jettison of the Launch Escape System and also as it develops some friction as it goes up through the heavy Earth's atmosphere. The (close-out) crew now, as they prepare the Boost Protective Cover, will also be going around the White Room doing what's called 'breaking up the White Room' or generally preparing it for retraction. Once the close-out crew departs the White Room area, that White Room will be retracted to a stand-by position. It will remain in that stand-by position down through the countdown to the T minus 5-minute mark, at which time it will come back to the fully retract position. Now T minus 1 hour, 28 minutes, 52 seconds and counting; this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-01:19:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T minus 1 hour, 19 minutes, 58 seconds and counting. At this time, the close-out crew has reported from the White Room that they are in the last stages of clearing out the White Room and making it ready for its retract position. Also going on at this time are some computer checks with the launch vehicle. These computer checks will be run continuously throughout the final portion of the countdown to ensure that the ground computers are communicating properly with the computers aboard the space vehicle. The launch crew had been having some problems with a vent valve in the first stage of the liquid oxygen tank. As mentioned earlier, the liquid oxygen as it does boil off, is vented to the atmosphere. One of these vent valves appeared to be sticking; that problem now does appear to be solved as it has been brought closed. Now at T minus 1 hour, 19 minutes, 8 seconds and counting; this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-01:10:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T minus 1 hour, 9 minutes, 59 seconds and counting. At this time in the Command Module Odyssey, the three crewmen; spacecraft commander Jim Lovell, Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert, and Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise; are very busy. The spacecraft commander and Command Module Pilot are configuring the Stabilization and Control System for lift-off and aligning that system with the guidance platform aboard the spacecraft. Also going on at this time is a check of the large propulsion system engine below the Service Module. This engine can be gimbaled in response to commands. This is done in two ways and these systems are being checked out at this time. There is a thumbwheel control which can set the engine to a preset position for certain maneuvers and also a Rotational Hand Controller which can be used for the actual flight of a maneuver. These checks are being made now, the engine being gimbaled with spacecraft commander Jim Lovell indicating the position that he is putting these to and readouts are being made to ensure that the engine is gimbaling a proper response. Also at this time a final checkout by the crew of the Entry Monitoring System, also a final setting of this system. Our countdown proceeding well at this time; T minus 1 hour, 8 minutes, 40 seconds; this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-01:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're just passing the 1-hour mark in our countdown. Now in the final hour of the countdown toward the launch of Apollo 13. The close-out crew has now left the White Room area, and will be standing by for the retraction to the 12-degree position of swing arm number 9. We've received word from the distinguished guest site that the stands over there are near capacity with some 4,500 guests in the area. The Vice President of the United States, Spiro Agnew, and Chancellor Willie Brandt, his special guest, have arrived in the area although they are not at the stands yet. Out on the causeway, at a guest site, we have 7,000. This is the largest guest number that we have ever had on our causeway site. To recap our countdown, which has gone - proceeded very well today - we resumed the count after a 9-hour and 13-minute built-in hold at 4:13 am this morning. At that time the cryogenic loading began. This is loading aboard, the extremely cold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Liquid hydrogen is the fuel for the second and third stage. Liquid oxygen, the oxidizer used on all three stages. RP-1 or rocket propellant number 1 is the fuel used in the first stage. It is a kerosene-type fuel and was loaded before the countdown demonstration test back in mid-March. The cryogenic loading went well. There is over 800,000 gallons of cryogenics loaded aboard the Saturn V vehicle at this time. We entered a 1-hour built-in hold. This is a planned hold at the T-minus 3-hour and 30-minute mark. The crew was alerted this morning shortly before 9:00 am by Colonel Tom Stafford, Chief of the Astronaut Office. They then proceeded for a short but brief medical examination by Dr. John Teegen and Dr. Alan Harter. They were pronounced in good shape and ready for their flight. They then had the traditional breakfast of steak and eggs, tenderloin steak, eggs, orange juice, coffee, jelly and toast. After a brief mission briefing, they donned their space suits and took the 8-mile trip in a transfer van to the pad area. They have now been in the spacecraft going through a variety of tests and checks, going over all their switch lists and so on. Our weather at this time is better than had been predicted earlier. We're still looking for some clouds to move into the area and will be expecting a temperature of approximately 80 degrees at our launch time. We continue counting down toward a launch time of 2:13 pm EST. Now at T-minus 57 minutes, 15 seconds and counting; this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-00:55:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T minus 55 minutes and counting, T minus 55 minutes and counting and the countdown continues to go well here at the Kennedy Space Center. The close-out crew has now left the White Room. We're standing by for the retraction of the swing arm, swing arm number 9. That's actually scheduled to come at the 43-minute mark in the countdown. However, the close-out crew did leave somewhat early so that event could come a little bit earlier than scheduled. Now we'll go to the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas for a status.
-00:54:27|P|PAO|This is Mission Control, Houston. At the present time the flight controllers here in Mission Control are monitoring the countdown and the status of the crew, the launch vehicle, and the spacecraft. The world-wide manned space flight network is up and ready to support the launch. We do have a problem with the Vanguard tracking ship downrange in the mid-Atlantic. A tracking data processor, we understand, is down on the Vanguard and we will not get high speed radar tracking unless this problem is cleared up. The Vanguard is a desirable element of the tracking network, but is not essential, and we're Go to continue the launch with that problem. Just a few minutes ago, Ken Mattingly, who until a few days ago was the prime Command Module Pilot for Apollo 13, arrived in Mission Control, Ken will be assisting at the CapCom console and he's joined astronaut John Young and astronaut Joe Kerwin on the CapCom console. As he arrived in Mission Control, Flight Director Milton Windler greeted him and said, 'Sorry to see you here, Ken.' This is Mission Control, Houston at T minus 53 minutes and 20 seconds.
-00:50:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T minus 49 minutes, 58 seconds and counting. At this time we're making some preparations for range safety command system checks. These checks are the system aboard the launch vehicle which could be used by the range safety officers to destroy the vehicle should it stray off path - off its intended course. These destruct actions, of course, would not be taken until the astronaut crew had been advised and were safely away from the vehicle. We're also standing by to wait for swing arm 9 to retract. That should be happening within the next 5 or 10 minutes. The countdown continuing to move along nicely in the last hour. Now T minus 49 minutes, 20 seconds and counting; this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-00:45:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T minus 45 minutes and counting, T minus 45 minutes and counting. Steps are now underway for moving the swing arm back to the 12-degree or park position. Launch site recovery forces have called in at this point and have indicated they're on station and ready to support the launch of Apollo 13. The prime crew, inside the spacecraft at this time, left the Manned Spacecraft Operations Building at Kennedy Space Center at 11:07 am Eastern Strandard Time this morning on their way out to the pad. They took the 8-mile trip in the transfer van, went up to the White Room level where spacecraft commander Jim Lovell was the first one to board the spacecraft at 11:32 am. He was followed by the Lunar Module Pilot who moved in; Fred Haise moved into the right-hand seat at 11:32. The Command Module Pilot, stood by in the elevator with a suit technician, was the last one to come aboard. He came aboard at 11:44 am Eastern Strandard Time. We are now standing by for retraction of the White Room. That should occur in approximately 47 seconds. When it comes back, it will come back to a 12-degree or standby position. From this position, it can be quickly brought back to the Command Module if there is a need for the crew to egress or if we need to get a team in to the crew. At the T minus 5-minute mark in the countdown, the swing arm number 9 will come back to the fully retract position and it will then stay in the fully retract position throughout the launch. Once the White Room has been moved back to the 12-degree position, the Launch Escape Tower above the Command Module will be armed. Now standing by for the movement of the swing arm 9, some 5 seconds from this time. T minus 43 minutes and counting, and swing arm 9 should be coming back. Swing arm 9 moving back now to the 12-degree position, it's about some 10 feet now from the spacecraft. We now have word that the Vice-President Spiro Agnew, and the Chancellor of West Germany, Willy Brandt, have arrived at the distinguished guest site. Now at T minus 42 minutes, 31 seconds and counting; this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-00:39:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T minus 39 minutes, 57 seconds and counting. At this time the command destruct system tests are now underway with the launch vehicle team. The Launch Escape System above the Command Module has now been armed and that escape system now would be capable of lifting the Command Module free of the launch vehicle should a problem arise. A correction to the last announcement - the Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise entered the spacecraft at 11:38 am Eastern Standard Time this morning. Our countdown proceeding at this time; T minus 39 minutes, 24 seconds and counting; this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-00:38:55|P|PAO|This is a test on PAO release. Test 1-2-3-4-5 5-4-3-2-1 Test out.
-00:35:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control at T-minus 34 minutes, 58 seconds and counting. At this time, the range safety command checks have just been completed. Preparations are now under way for the power transfer test. This is a critical test to ensure that the power can be transferred from the external source, which we have been using to conserve on batteries, to ensure that the power can be successfully transferred to the batteries aboard the space vehicle and that the systems are Go on those space vehicle batteries. Now at T-minus 34 minutes, 30 seconds and counting; this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-00:30:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, as we move into the final half hour of our countdown; T minus 29 minutes, 56 seconds and counting. The Brevard Sheriff's Department, Brevard County, Florida has reported that along route 1, the closest major highway to Kennedy Space Center, there are some 100,000 people and 25,000 cars parked watching for the launch of Apollo 13. Along the Indian and Banana Rivers it's reported that the - both rivers are literally filled with boats and spectators standing by to watch the launch. A private airport in Brevard County also reports some 500 private planes have landed and are parked at the airport. Our countdown continuing now - the power transfer test underway - T minus 29 minutes, 13 seconds and counting; this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-00:25:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; we're at T minus 25 minutes and counting, T minus 25 minutes and counting. And that critical launch vehicle power transfer test has been successfully completed. The Lunar Module will remain on internal power for approximately 10 minutes while the instrumentation aboard the Lunar Module is thoroughly checked out. It will then be deactivated and won't be reactivated again until the men enter the Lunar Module on their trip to the Moon. As the Apollo/Saturn V sits on the pad at this time, it's 214,369 nautical miles [397,011 km] from their destination - from their destination, the Moon. Now T minus 24 minutes, 20 seconds and counting; this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-00:23:12|P|PAO|This is a test on PAO release. Test 1-2-3-4-5 5-4-3-2-1 Test out.
-00:21:57|P|PAO|This is a test on PAO release. Test 1-2-3-4-5 5-4-3-2-1 Test out.
-00:20:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T minus 19 minutes, 59 seconds and counting. Now at - passing the 20-minute mark in our countdown and the Spacecraft Test Supervisor has indicated that they are running just slightly ahead of that in their countdown. The Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert is now pressurizing the Service Module Reaction Control System. This is the system on the Service Module which consists of 4 quadrants with 4 engines each. Each one of these develops 100 pounds of thrust. He is arming these systems by letting the hypergolic fuels - these are monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide - flow down through the system, down to the final valves. Hypergolic fuels ignite on contact, so once those final valves are open they would ignite and the system would be activated. Swigert also reading out the temperatures and pressures of that system. The countdown moving along well at this time; T minus 19 minutes, 4 seconds and counting; this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-00:15:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control passing the 15-minute mark; T-minus 14 minutes, 57 seconds and counting. Chilldown of the second stage or S-II stage start tanks is in progress. This is necessary to prepare those start tanks for the flow of the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The S-II or second stage will ignite at some 2 minutes, 46 seconds into the mission if all goes as planned. The crew has been relatively quiet answering the Spacecraft Test Conductor Skip Chauvin in terse business-like manner as he questions them on certain switches and checks. In the distinguished guest site, the Vice President Spiro Agnew, the Chancellor of West Germany Willie Brandt and a Secretary of State Rogers, all with a large crowd over there awaiting the launch of Apollo 13. Our countdown continuing to go well at this time. The spacecraft is now going to full internal power. Up to this point it's been sharing its power load with the fuel cells aboard the spacecraft with an external power source. Also being carried out at this time is a astrocomm launch circuit check. This is the circuit that is used by the astronauts, the Spacecraft Test Conductor and Launch Operations Manager and the CapCom Stoney or Paul Weitz here during the launch phase of the mission. Now T-minus 13 minutes, 33 seconds and counting; this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-00:10:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T minus 9 minutes, 58 seconds and counting. The third stage start tanks are now beginning their chill down. Third stage scheduled to ignite at 9 minutes, 22 seconds into the mission. Also going on at this time is one of the computer checks which are carried out throughout the final portion of the launch. This particular one is a checkout of the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer to ensure that it is ready for launch. A final check of the weather indicates that earlier worries about the weather have come to naught. Weather looks good and is satisfactory; presents no constraint to our launch. Now at T minus 9 minutes, 25 seconds and counting; this is Kennedy Launch Control.
-00:05:31|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control; T minus 5 minutes, 27 seconds and counting. Now as we move in to the final phase of the countdown, we're receiving Go/No Go checks from various elements of the launch team. The Spacecraft Test Conductor Skip Chauvin gave the test supervisor a spacecraft ready. At that time, on our large status board here in the firing room, the green light came on behind the spacecraft. The green light now is also on behind the Emergency Detection System. Now standing by for more checks. The Mission Director Chet Lee from the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston says we are Go for launch and the range indicates that the range is ready to support. Chilldown of the S-IVB stage - chilldown of the S-IVB stage being completed at this time. S-IVB will ignite into the mission at 9 minutes, 22 seconds. Swing arm number 9 now is retracting to the full retract position. Swing arm number 9 coming back to the full retract position. And the Director of Launch Operations Walt Kapryan has given Apollo 13 a Go for launch. We're now approaching the four-minute mark. At the T minus 4-minute mark, we'll be standing by for Jack Baltar, the Launch Vehicle Test Conductor, to say that his launch vehicle team is ready to carry out the final phase here of the countdown. At the T minus 3-minute, 7-second mark, we will get the ignition sequence start. This will put us on an automatic sequencer and the remainder of the count from that time will be on automatic. The sequencer can check out literally hundreds of items in the space vehicle. At the same time, the team here in the Launch Control Center will be monitoring redline values. These are such things as temperatures and pressures which we do not want to either go above or below. A final communications check now. The astronauts on the astrocomm circuit and Launch Operations Manager Paul Donnelly, during his final check said, 'Good luck, head for the hills.' He was referring to the Fra Mauro - hilly Fra Mauro region of the Moon. As we come up on the T minus 3-minute mark at 3 minutes, the capsule communicator Paul Weitz will begin reading out the minus time to the crew. Looking up at our status board now, we can see that the spacecraft - or the first stage preparations are now complete. The firing command has now been initiated. This is the automatic sequencer and we have a confirmation on our status board that the launch sequence has started.
-00:02:57|P|PAO|We're now in our final 3 minutes of the countdown. Two minutes, 56 seconds and Apollo 13 continues to be Go. The astronauts still reporting back from the spacecraft Odyssey. Spacecraft commander Jim Lovell says Odyssey is Go. He will be the last one to perform a function here during the countdown. At the T minus 45-second mark, the commander Jim Lovell will set the final alignment of the spacecraft guidance and that's the last crew action before the lift-off of Apollo 13. We continue to aim for a lift-off at 2:13 pm Eastern Standard Time.
-00:02:18|P|PAO|Now T minus 2 minutes, 18 seconds and counting. And our count continues to look good. Our weather is no constraint to launch today. Earlier fears about the weather seem to have dissipated. A stationary front over the Florida-Georgia border has not sent down the predicted bad weather that we had feared. We just passed the two-minute mark - just passed the two-minute mark in the countdown and the pressurization now of the vehicle tanks is beginning.
-00:01:48|P|PAO|The third stage liquid oxygen tank has now been pressurized and the second stage liquid oxygen tank has been pressurized. We'll be making our final transfer from external power source, that is from the external power source at the pad, to the launch vehicle batteries at the T minus 50-second mark. We'll be keeping an eye on that power transfer at T minus 50 seconds. The S-IVB propellants now all pressurized. S-IVB propellants, that's the third stage of the Saturn V, pressurized. One minute, 15 seconds and counting. The spacecraft equipment now is on its own internal cooling. It's been sharing its cooling from - getting its cooling from an external power source up to this time.
-00:01:01|P|PAO|We're now approaching the T minus 1-minute mark. T minus 1 minute; T minus 1 minute and counting. Now in the final minute of our countdown. At the 30-second mark, swing arm number 1 will retract.
-00:00:48|P|PAO|T minus 50 seconds as we pass the T minus 50-second mark, power transfer takes place. First stage, second stage, third stage and the Instrument Unit going to internal power. T minus 37 seconds and our count continues to go well. We'll be looking for an ignition of those five first stage engines at the T minus 8.9-second mark.
-00:00:25|P|PAO|We have passed T minus 30. T minus 25 seconds and counting and Apollo 13 is Go.
-00:00:19|P|PAO|T minus 20 seconds. T minus 20 seconds and counting.
-00:00:15|P|PAO|17 - Guidance Release -
-00:00:13|P|PAO|15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, ignition sequence has started.

000:04:15|O|CDR|Okay.
000:04:16|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. You are Go at 4 minutes. The little red lines are right on the little white lines down here.
000:04:22|T|CDR|Sounds good.
000:04:30|O|CDR|Coming up on one g.
000:04:31|O|CMP|Boy, we're right on. We're about a mile and two-tenths high, though, but we're right on V<sub>i</sub> and right on H-dot.
000:04:33|P|PAO|Velocity now up to 11,000 feet per second. That's about 36 percent of the amount needed for a minimum orbit. We're now 75 miles in altitude.
000:04:36|O|CDR|That's ... One g. You could walk around here.
000:04:51|O|CMP|I bet I never had such a view. Freddo ... -
000:04:51|P|PAO|222 miles downrange now. The EECOM reports -
000:04:55|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Coming up 5 minutes. You're looking perfect. Over.
000:04:59|T|CDR|13; Roger.
000:05:01|P|PAO|And EECOM reports that cabin pressure is sealed at 6.1 pound, which is normal. We are now 250 miles downrange, altitude 81 nautical miles.
000:05:04|O|CDR|... gimbal motors.
000:05:05|O|CMP|Okay. Watching 8.
000:05:30|P|PAO|And at 5 minutes 30 seconds into the launch, we continue to look very good on the second stage.
000:05:32|T|CDR|Inboard.
000:05:32|O|CMP|Inboard.
000:05:35|P|PAO|Jim Lovell just reported the inboard engine has shut down as scheduled.
000:05:36|C|Kerwin|Rog. We confirm inboard out.
000:05:38|O|CDR|That shouldn't have happened.
000:05:40|O|LMP|No. That's 7:42. That's 2 minutes early.
000:05:44|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Stand by for S-IVB to COI capability.
000:05:48|T|CDR|S-IVB to COI. Roger.
000:05:49|C|Kerwin|Roger. You've got it now, Jim.
000:05:52|T|CDR|We've got S-IVB to COI.
000:05:53|O|LMP|Okay. Gim(bal) motors, Jim. Set 1.
000:05:55|O|CDR|Okay. Pitch 1.
000:05:56|P|PAO|That booster reports that the inboard engine shutdown was a bit early. We are continuing to burn on the 4 outboard engines.
000:05:57|O|LMP|Good.
000:05:58|O|CDR|Yaw 1.
000:05:59|O|LMP|Good. Pitch 2.
000:06:00|O|CDR|Pitch 2.
000:06:01|O|LMP|Good.
000:06:02|O|CDR|Yaw 2  -
000:06:03|C|Kerwin|You're Go at 6 minutes, 13.
000:06:06|T|CDR|Go at 6.
000:06:10|T|CDR|And, Houston, what's the story on engine 5?
000:06:14|C|Kerwin|Jim, Houston. We don't have a story on why the inboard out was early, but the other engines are Go and you are Go.
000:06:21|T|CDR|Roger.
000:06:24|O|LMP|Okay. We're - we're a little bit low on H-dot, now, but that's to be expected.
000:06:28|O|CDR|Okay. We're Mode II, gentlemen, Mode II.
000:06:39|P|PAO|At 6 minutes, 40 seconds -
000:06:41|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Still looking good. Your gimbals are good; trim is good.
000:06:45|T|CDR|Roger.
000:06:46|O|CDR|We just checked the trim. It doesn't fit.
000:06:53|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Level sense arm time, 8 plus 38 nominal; S-II cut-off time, 9 plus 48. Over.
000:07:02|T|CDR|Roger. Nominal on the level sense arm, 9:48 on the S-II cut-off.
000:07:06|O|CMP|It's going to run -
000:07:08|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative, and stand by for S-IVB to orbit.
000:07:11|C|Kerwin|Mark.
000:07:12|C|Kerwin|You have S-IVB to orbit, Jim.
000:07:14|T|CDR|Roger. We have S-IVB to orbit.
000:07:23|O|CDR|Didn't like that inboard.
000:07:23|P|PAO|We still have four good engines on the Saturn second stage. We show an altitude of 96 nautical miles, 545 downrange.
000:07:32|O|CMP|Okay, we're 1,400 feet a second low on V<sub>i</sub>. That's not too bad.
000:07:38|O|CDR|Watch the trajectory closely, Jack.
000:07:41|O|CMP|Yes, will do.
000:07:41|P|PAO|And at 7 minutes, 45 seconds; booster reports we are Go. All four engines remaining are looking good.
000:07:48|O|CMP|We're right at H ... is good - H-dot is a little bit low; V<sub>i</sub> is low, but that's understandable.
000:07:53|O|CDR|Okay.
000:07:56|O|CDR|You're S-IVB to orbit capability now.
000:07:56|P|PAO|The early shutdown on the center engine would cause no problem. We would burn a little bit longer than normally scheduled -
000:08:02|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Looking good at 8 minutes.
000:08:04|T|CDR|13; Roger.
000:08:05|O|CDR|How's those systems, Fred? Are there any -
000:08:08|O|LMP|They're looking good.
000:08:13|O|CMP|Okay, now, H-dot is low, Jim ... S-IVB ought to pick you up.
000:08:17|P|PAO|And at 8 minutes, 17 seconds; we show a velocity of 18,000 feet per second. That's about 71 per cent of the amount needed for minimum orbit.
000:08:19|O|CDR|Yes. Hey, I got a - We got a funny vibration
000:08:27|O|LMP|Yes. Yes, there was a bit of noise, there. Yes.
000:08:31|O|CMP|...
000:08:35|P|PAO|At 8 minutes, 35 seconds; continuing to burn on the second stage. All four remaining engines looking good at this point.
000:08:45|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. Mark, level sense arm.
000:08:48|T|CDR|Mark level sense arm. Roger.
000:08:58|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. At 9 minutes, you're Go; the CMC is Go.
000:09:02|T|CMP|Okay, Joe.
000:09:04|T|CDR|13; Roger.
000:09:11|P|PAO|Our predicted shutdown time on the second stage is 9 minutes, 48 seconds. Flight Director Milton Windler getting a staging status now from his flight controller.
000:09:19|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. You are Go for staging.
000:09:22|T|CDR|13; Roger. Go for staging.
000:09:45|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. Stand by for mode IV capability.
000:09:48|C|Kerwin|Mark.
000:09:49|C|Kerwin|You have mode IV, Jim.
000:09:50|T|CDR|Mode IV. Roger. Staging.
000:09:57|P|PAO|And Lovell reports staging.
000:09:57|C|Kerwin|Roger. Staging.
000:10:00|T|CDR|And S-IV ignition, Houston.
000:10:04|C|Kerwin|Roger that, Jim. Thrust looks good.
000:10:07|T|CDR|Roger.
000:10:17|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. You're looking good. Trajectory, guidance, CMC are all Go.
000:10:23|T|CDR|Thank you, Joe.
000:10:26|P|PAO|And at 10 minutes, 30 seconds; we are now at an altitude of 1,080 miles down range.
000:10:28|O|LMP|Right on H; good on H-dot; 200 feet a second low on V<sub>isp</sub>.
000:10:32|O|CDR|Remember, we're Mode IV now.
000:10:34|O|LMP|Yes, I got that. Mode IV.

000:10:54|O|CDR|Everything looking good.
000:10:58|O|CMP|We're looking good, Jim; trajectory's looking good.
000:11:00|O|CDR|Sounds good, okay.
000:11:09|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. At 11 minutes, you're Go. Predicted cut-off on the S-IVB is 12 plus 34. Over.
000:11:15|O|CMP|...
000:11:19|O|CDR|What?
000:11:23|O|CMP|Okay, going to ... deadband now, guys. We're 102.5 - shutdown velocity -
000:11:32|O|CDR|25,562.
000:11:35|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. You're Go at 11&frac12;, and predicted cut-off time is 12 plus 34. Over.
000:11:42|T|CDR|Understand; 12 plus 34 predicted cut-off time.
000:11:45|C|Kerwin|That's affirm.
000:11:46|O|CMP|25,562 looks good.
000:11:57|P|PAO|Coming up on 12 minutes. Still looking good.
000:11:58|O|CMP|Okay - Do we shut down at - Freddo?
000:12:02|O|LMP|Yes.
000:12:03|O|CMP|What's - Shutdown is when?
000:12:05|O|LMP|... you get the last page, Jack; you got the clean-up stuff.
000:12:14|O|CDR|Stand by for SECO.
000:12:15|O|LMP|All the systems stuff. You got to freeze at SECO.
000:12:18|O|CMP|Yes.
000:12:19|P|PAO|We're standing by for a crew report on the third stage shutdown.
000:12:20|O|LMP|I'm going to just jump right in ...
000:12:31|T|CDR|SECO.
000:12:32|C|Kerwin|Copy SECO, Jim. We're looking at the DSKY.
000:12:36|T|CDR|Roger.
000:12:45|P|PAO|And the Flight Dynamics officer says at first glance we look good on the orbit.
000:13:02|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. You have a Go orbit all sources, and the booster is safe. Over.
000:13:07|T|CDR|Go orbit and the booster is safe. Thank you, Joe.
000:13:10|C|Kerwin|Don't mention it.
000:13:30|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. We copy your Noun 44.
000:13:34|T|CMP|Okay, Joe.
000:13:55|P|PAO|The booster engineer reports at this time that the S-IVB third stage looks good. Being configured now for orbital operations. We're standing by for a confirmation from the Flights Dynamics Officer about our preliminary orbit.
000:14:57|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. Your preliminary orbit down here is 102.5 times 100.3 [nautical miles, 189.8 by 185.8 km], and everything is looking good.
000:15:06|T|CDR|Roger, Houston. And it looks good to be up here again.
000:15:10|C|Kerwin|I'll bet.
000:15:34|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. I have your Z torquing angle. You ready?
000:15:42|T|CDR|Jack is ready to copy, Joe.
000:15:44|C|Kerwin|Okay. It's plus decimal 26. Over.
000:15:52|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. Plus 0.26.
000:15:55|C|Kerwin|That's Roger.
000:16:54|P|PAO|This is Mission Control at 17 minutes. We've had Loss Of Signal with the spacecraft. We'll be reacquiring shortly through the Canary Island Tracking Station. The total burn duration on the third stage was about 45 seconds longer than planned; we would not expect at this point that this would have any serious effect on the Translunar Injection, the fact that we did consume a bit more propellant out of the third stage than was originally planned. We are standing by now for Acquisition Of Signal through the Canary Island Station. We should be reacquiring radio contact with the spacecraft shortly.
000:21:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control; we're still standing by for any conversation with the spacecraft over Canary Islands. The booster systems engineer reports that at this point he has no explanation for the early shutdown of the S-II - Saturn second stage - center engine.
000:21:39|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
000:21:42|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
000:21:44|C|Kerwin|Okay. Couple minutes to LOS, Jim. Everything is looking real good. Your AOS time at Carnarvon will be 52:36, and we don't have too much of a handle on why the inboard cut off early except that it apparently was an engine problem and not a switch select function. But we're certain that you'll be able to make TLI based on what we're looking at now.
000:22:11|T|CDR|Roger. There's nothing like an interesting launch.
000:22:14|C|Kerwin|That's right.
000:23:14|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. Canary LOS in 30 seconds. Request Command Reset, please.
000:23:21|T|CDR|Roger. Command Reset coming on.
000:23:24|C|Kerwin|Thank you.
000:23:25|O|CMP|Hey, you guys, are you ready? I've done my other item there; I'm ready to give you - mags.
000:23:30|O|CDR|Well, all right, fine. Let's just get this one done first.
000:23:33|O|CMP|Okay.
000:23:34|O|CDR|What else do you have to do here?
000:23:35|O|LMP|Okay. Going Bit Rate.
000:23:40|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. Request Low Bit Rate, please. Over.
000:23:44|T|CDR|Low Bit Rate.
000:23:46|O|Unidentifiable crewmember (onboard)|Okay.
000:23:47|O|CDR|Okay. The pressure's okay?
000:23:49|O|LMP|Yes. Let's see now, Jim, there's one more reading there; you gave me the - you gave me the helium pressure, 4100. What's the manifold pressure on that one?
000:23:59|O|CDR|The manifold pressure is reading about 80.
000:24:05|O|LMP|Eighty? Okay, give me the number 1, then.
000:24:07|O|CDR|Okay, number 1. And Helium temperature is 80, Helium pressure is 4100, and the manifold pressure is about 100.
000:24:18|O|LMP|Manifold's about 100. Okay.
000:24:19|O|CMP|Okay, Freddo. Have a look - the cabin and suit doing? Before we -
000:24:22|O|LMP|They're both pretty equal, now, at about 5/5.
000:24:25|O|CDR|Okay.
000:24:26|O|CDR|Well, let's - We'll break the ...
000:24:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had Loss Of Signal now with the spacecraft at the Canary Island Tracking Station; we won't reacquire again until the spacecraft reaches the tracking station at Canarvon, Australia. That will be at a Ground Elapsed Time of 52 minutes, 36 seconds. Recapping at the time we lost contact with the spacecraft through Canary Islands, we looked to be in very good shape for the Translunar Injection burn, with the Saturn third stage. The second stage center engine shut down about 2 minutes early; the total overburn time on the third stage was about 10 seconds. We don't expect that this would have any effect on the Translunar Injection. At 25 minutes, 20 seconds; this is Mission Control, Houston.
000:24:27|O|CMP|Okay, let's do it. Freddo, here's your bag.
000:24:32|O|LMP|Okay. Jim.
000:24:39|O|LMP|Okay, for that item, those two I can check off. You got the Z-torquing angle?
000:24:43|O|CMP|Yes.
000:24:44|O|LMP|I've checked the caution and warning; you've done that. We're up - we're up to item 9.
000:24:49|O|CMP|How we doing time line?
000:24:51|O|LMP|We're a little behind, but it's the kind of stuff that we can catch up lickety-split with.
000:24:57|O|CMP|Okay.
000:25:04|O|LMP|Okay. Let me get - make sure I got this item. I want A, Simplex. Hell, it was already there. B to Off. No, it wasn't. It's just a hard switch again. They really fake you out, these switches -
000:25:18|O|CMP|Yes. I've noticed -
000:25:19|O|LMP|- they move so hard.
000:25:20|O|CMP|I've noticed that, Fred.
000:25:21|O|LMP|Compared with the simulator. Okay, let me check item 13 off; I've completed that one. Let's see.
000:25:30|O|CMP|Yes. I've got -
000:25:37|O|CDR|Jack, be careful in your movements now.
000:25:39|O|CMP|Yes. I'm not having any problems so far.
000:25:41|O|CDR|Okay.
000:25:43|O|LMP|PCM Bit Rate is Low. I did the Command Reset in Normal. I'll do it again, just to make sure. I have an A, Simplex, and B, Off. That's great. Jack, could you hand me one thing?
000:25:58|O|CMP|What - what would you like?
000:25:59|O|LMP|One of those spring jobbers, there, I can -
000:26:00|O|CMP|Yes.
000:26:01|O|LMP|- flip across -
000:26:02|O|CMP|I was going to ask you, if you wanted one of those, Fred.
000:26:03|O|LMP|Yes. Okay. Now that'll take care of my checklist for me.
000:26:15|O|CMP|A springy jobber coming up.
000:26:17|O|LMP|Thank you. No, no; you got one of the other ones with the hook?
000:26:24|O|CMP|I got the wrong kind?
000:26:25|O|LMP|Yes. It's a little longer one with the hook.
000:26:28|O|CMP|Are they in the same - They in the same - ...?
000:26:35|O|LMP|Now that's a good question.
000:26:37|O|CMP|Well, I'll tell you - Let me - I don't see them down here, now.
000:26:41|O|LMP|Sure enough. It really is zero g.
000:26:47|O|CDR|Well, gentlemen, I'll break out my two gold pens.
000:26:50|O|LMP|The longest Napierian trajectory in the world.
000:26:56|O|CMP|Yes. We had - I had a long boost ride, didn't we?
000:26:59|O|LMP|Man!
000:27:00|O|CDR|Twelve minutes and 30 some seconds.
000:27:01|O|LMP|I'll tell you, gang, I was a little worried for a pinch or two.
000:27:04|O|CDR|When I called, 'Inboard,' I was - It was natural; then I looked at the time -
000:27:07|O|CMP|Yes -
000:27:08|O|CDR|- and I said, 'That's not natural.'
000:27:09|O|CMP|We were 2 minutes early. Five minutes and 32 seconds, if you want to write that down.
000:27:12|O|CDR|Okay, good. Okay, my helmet coming off.
000:27:15|O|LMP|Shoot, if they recorded that -
000:27:16|O|CMP|- (Laughter) Yes -
000:27:17|O|LMP|- it'd be heck.
000:27:18|O|CMP|(Laughter) I know it.
000:27:24|O|CMP|Well, you know, I think I'll just - I'll just let this thing pull right up to the top.
000:27:29|O|LMP|You haven't found that other one, yet, have you?
000:27:30|O|CMP|No, Fred; I haven't -
000:27:32|O|CDR|What are you looking for?
000:27:33|O|LMP|A clamp. Oh -
000:27:35|O|CMP|I think those are down - those are in one of the lower -
000:27:38|O|LMP|Okay. You want to give me that other one back here, I'll see if I - Trouble is, I got no hooks that are the right length apart for my goddamn ... Fiddle with it. I'll just hang on to it tight and ...
000:27:55|O|CMP|By golly! Guys!
000:28:03|O|CMP|Hey, that's - All that stuff about the helmet's being hard to get into the bag is true.
000:28:15|O|CDR|Okay, let's see. At 052:36, we're going to pick them up over Canaries.
000:28:20|O|LMP|Great -
000:28:21|O|CDR|And, gentlemen, you are now passing the beautiful Atlantic Ocean.
000:28:30|O|LMP|I'm glad we checked PGNCS.
000:28:37|O|CDR|Say, I never thought - You guys want to take a look - look at - Excuse me a second. I'm going to turn out those floodlights. I wanted to show Ken - When I turn out all the lights in just a second, you can see thunder and lightning on the horizon.
000:28:55|O|LMP|Sure as hell can.
000:28:56|O|CDR|And also, you might be able, if your eyes become accustomed to it - you might be able to see the - the airglow. There, you can. You can see the airglow.
000:29:05|O|CMP|Yes. I sure can.
000:29:06|O|CDR|See that airglow?
000:29:07|O|CMP|I can see that lightning, too.
000:29:09|O|LMP|Oh, I - I won't be able to see ...
000:29:10|O|LMP|Hey, that's -
000:29:12|O|LMP|El Scorpio, isn't it?
000:29:13|O|CDR|Yes, but see the - Antares is in the airglow layer.
000:29:16|O|LMP|Yes, it is. Right in it.
000:29:18|O|CDR|And then right below that, way - about a half a degree, that's -
000:29:20|O|LMP|The next star down there?
000:29:21|O|CDR|Yes.
000:29:22|O|LMP|Yes.
000:29:23|O|CDR|So, if you lift the lights, we'll see again.
000:29:27|O|CMP|Okay, I'm ready for the main Reg check, Fred, if you're ready.
000:29:30|O|LMP|Okay. Go ahead. I'll tell you when. ... just call it on.
000:29:35|O|CMP|Okay. Main Reg B going closed. Emergency Cabin Pressure selector 1, Push To Test.
000:29:45|O|LMP|Did you Push To Test?
000:29:46|O|CMP|Yes. There it is.
000:29:47|O|LMP|Good.
000:29:48|O|CMP|Okay.
000:29:49|O|LMP|Good.
000:29:50|O|CMP|Main Reg B valve, Open; A going closed.
000:29:54|O|LMP|Closed. Next step?
000:29:56|O|CMP|Cabin - Cabin Pressure selector 2, Push To Test.
000:30:00|O|LMP|Okay, that's good.
000:30:02|O|CMP|Main Reg valve B - or A, Open, and Emergency Cabin Pressure selector, closed. Okay, Jim. I got to get to - to those ... here.
000:30:14|O|CDR|Okay.
000:30:23|O|CDR|Okay.
000:30:24|O|CMP|... down there?
000:30:27|O|LMP|Up in L-2, Jack.
000:30:28|O|CMP|Yes, that's where I'm looking.
000:30:32|O|LMP|You're kidding. I thought you said the helmet was tough to get in this bag. Piece of cake. Have you got - have you got one of those big helmets?
000:30:41|O|CMP|Yes - No, I don't think - unless I got a bigger head.
000:30:44|O|LMP|You don't have a Borman special, do you?
000:30:46|O|CMP|No.
000:30:47|O|CDR|We all have Borman specials.
000:30:48|O|CMP|Really?
000:30:49|O|CDR|Yes.
000:30:50|O|CMP|Maybe your damn bag won't fit anymore with that one ... have to slip it in this one.
000:30:54|O|CMP|Yes. ... a little bit. I got a tool E.
000:31:06|O|CDR|Okay. Got a tool E?
000:31:09|O|CMP|Yes.
000:31:12|O|CDR|Well, is there anything else we can be doing right now? Like COAS?
000:31:14|O|LMP|Yes.
000:31:15|O|CMP|You can -
000:31:16|O|CDR|Yes.
000:31:17|O|CMP|- you can get out the ORDEAL box, if you could -
000:31:18|O|CDR|Yes -
000:31:19|O|CMP|- could you do that, Jim?
000:31:20|O|CDR|I'm going to try it right now.
000:31:21|O|CMP|That would save me a trip down under there.
000:31:22|O|CDR|Okay, that's right.
000:31:25|O|CMP|Okay. Okay -
000:31:28|O|CDR|You got to watch the time line now for -
000:31:29|O|CMP|Yes.
000:31:30|O|CDR|Okay.
000:31:35|O|CMP|I don't - I got to go stow my water wings. You guys got your water wings on?
000:31:40|O|LMP|No. I don't think I'm going to fiddle with that right now, Jack. They're not in my way.
000:31:45|O|CMP|Yes. I'll trade. We can get that later.
000:31:46|O|LMP|Hell, yes.
000:31:48|O|CDR|Well, I'll tell you what - I blew mine on 8.
000:31:52|O|CMP|Did you?
000:31:53|O|LMP|Yes. But you were the guy that - Jack should take his off. He's the guy moving around.
000:31:57|O|CDR|You're right.
000:31:58|O|CMP|Okay. I'll take mine off.
000:32:00|O|CDR|... really want ...
000:32:05|O|LMP|Man, I'll tell you, that first stage -
000:32:08|O|CMP|...
000:32:09|O|LMP|When that shut down, man, I thought I was going through the instrument panel. I'll tell you, that was - I was so surprised ... I had heard about it.
000:32:20|O|CDR|I should have warned you.
000:32:22|O|LMP|[Laughter.]
000:32:23|O|CMP|Yes, well. Something else -
000:32:24|O|LMP|Well -
000:32:26|O|CMP|- you got to get into.
000:32:27|O|CDR|... right in ...
000:32:28|O|LMP|Okay, let's see. Confirm normal, we've done that. We've stowed the water wings. Now it's the TSB is the only item left outstanding there.
000:32:36|O|CDR|Okay, I have the ORDEAL in place. Now, do you want the camera bracket?
000:32:44|O|CMP|Yes, your going to need that camera bracket up there.
000:32:50|O|LMP|Yes. Yes, I can feel a little bit of the zero-g effect, a little flushing in the face.
000:32:54|O|CMP|Yes.
000:32:55|O|CDR|Yes, that's that - Your blood rushes to your head because your heart doesn't have anything to pump against.
000:33:02|O|CMP|Yes, I can feel that, too.
000:33:05|O|CDR|Okay, I have the camera bracket.
000:33:08|O|CMP|Okay, have you got the - the ORDEAL mounted? I have -
000:33:10|O|CDR|The ORDEAL is mounted.
000:33:11|O|CMP|- I have VERB 82.
000:33:12|O|LMP|Okay, Jim. Are you ready to get busy on getting the RADs on the line?
000:33:16|O|CDR|I sure am.
000:33:17|O|LMP|Glycol Reservoir Bypass valve, Open.
000:33:19|O|CDR|Okay, Glycol Reservoir Bypass valve to Open.
000:33:25|O|LMP|Okay, Out valve, Close.
000:33:27|O|CDR|Out valve, Close.
000:33:29|O|LMP|The In valve, Close.
000:33:31|O|CDR|The In valve going Close.
000:33:34|O|LMP|Okay, now we need a little bit of quantity in the Accum - not the Accum, but we need the fill valve on for about 5 percent on down to 45 percent. That's about what it was in the ..., too.
000:33:46|O|CDR|Okay, what I'm going to do is -
000:33:47|O|LMP|CapCom said they wanted 50.
000:33:48|O|CDR|- ... the ORDEAL, then. The number 1 ball. Did you check the Verb 82?
000:33:57|O|CMP|Yes, I did. I wrote it down.
000:33:59|O|CDR|Okay.
000:34:00|O|CMP|I did that whole thing.
000:34:01|O|LMP|And we got the secondary RAD leak check to go. We got 'Unstow and mount TSB.'
000:34:07|O|CMP|Yes. I haven't done that yet.
000:34:10|O|LMP|And I got water wings in my lap here. That's it on that item - that page; it's done. So we're hanging up here. Let me proceed ahead and see what I can. I can do a purge. There are not any left for another 12 minutes or so.
000:34:28|O|CMP|Let me get the -
000:34:29|O|LMP|...
000:34:30|O|CMP|I got to get -
000:34:31|O|LMP|EPS monitor check, I can do Jim, I've been looking ahead to see what Jim can do. It says a GDC align somewhere in this thing.
000:34:36|O|CDR|Okay, I'm setting the ORDEAL right now.
000:34:40|O|LMP|Okay, well, that's the next thing you can do is a GDC align. Okay, you may - you may get some Master Alarms here, gang. I'm going to be doing a purge check. I'll just do the -
000:34:55|O|CMP|Fredo.
000:34:56|O|LMP|Yes.
000:34:57|O|CMP|Look what I got.
000:34:58|O|LMP|What have you got?
000:34:59|O|CMP|One with a hook on the end of it.
000:35:01|O|LMP|Beautiful.
000:35:02|O|CMP|Spring jobber-do.
000:35:03|O|LMP|Thank you.
000:35:09|O|CDR|Now, is there anything I can be doing?
000:35:10|O|CMP|I am giving you the sequence camera here, Jim.
000:35:13|O|CDR|Okay.
000:35:14|O|CMP|I tell you, I haven't checked the setting.
000:35:16|O|CDR|How about your optics?
000:35:17|O|CMP|I've got them unstowed. Now. ... that'd be 32.
000:35:32|O|CMP|... camera. Here's the power cable.
000:35:36|O|CDR|Thank you. Okay, 18 millimeter, f:8, and 250th.
000:35:47|O|CMP|Now, let's see. Let me give you a - it's f:8, 250th, 7 feet, 12 frames per second.
000:35:54|O|CDR|Okay. Go.
000:35:55|O|CMP|Magazine A.
000:35:56|O|CDR|Magazine A is on.
000:35:58|O|LMP|Hey, Jack, where'd you find these?
000:36:00|O|CMP|I found it right down in - Fred, in this stowage -
000:36:03|O|LMP|Do you have any longer ones?
000:36:04|O|CMP|No.
000:36:05|O|LMP|(Laughter)
000:36:06|O|CMP|No. It -
000:36:07|O|LMP|But that wasn't quite that long.
000:36:08|O|CMP|Yes, I know they do. And I'll tell you where it is; it's down in -
000:36:10|O|LMP|Okay.
000:36:11|O|CMP|- A-8. Can you make do with that for a minute?
000:36:13|O|LMP|Yes. I ...
000:36:14|O|CMP|Until I get - Okay, have you got ORDEAL - You got ORDEAL mounted?
000:36:22|O|CDR|I - I have ORDEAL mounted.
000:36:24|O|CMP|There we go.
000:36:25|O|LMP|Okay -
000:36:26|O|CMP|I got to get -
000:36:27|O|LMP|- right after - When did we insert, gang? Twelve something?
000:36:31|O|CDR|12:32 GET.
000:36:33|O|LMP|Okay. I'm looking for where I put the purge line heater on, so it was roughly about 14 minutes. We've been - we've been 20 minutes. Yes. ... Okay ...
000:36:43|O|CDR|Don't forget I still got the radiators bypassed here.
000:36:45|O|LMP|Yes. Okay, what I need though, Jim, is to - We got to pump up the - You want to - Let's finish that item. I need to pump up the accumulator a little bit. I mean use the accumulator to - Yes - to get it up to 50 percent.
000:36:58|O|CDR|Okay, you tell me what you want me to do here and I'll -
000:37:01|O|LMP|Can you reach the Prim Accum Fill valve, right there on your left?
000:37:05|O|CDR|I'll try.
000:37:07|O|LMP|Yes, that's the Primary. How are you doing, Jack?
000:37:11|O|CMP|Okay.
000:37:12|O|LMP|My countdown under way already?
000:37:13|O|CMP|Yes. But, you want to have a few ...?
000:37:19|O|LMP|Yes.
000:37:32|O|CDR|Okay, I'm putting the cable for you.
000:37:39|O|LMP|Excuse me a second; I want to ... the O<sub>2</sub> flow. Okay. Looks good. But if we get a Master Alarm, it'll come on with the H<sub>2</sub>. Okay? Fuel cell 2. O<sub>2</sub> flow.
000:37:56|O|Unidentifiable crewmember (onboard)|...
000:37:57|O|LMP|When it comes up flow, the H<sub>2</sub> banks up there like crazy. Looks like the simulator. The O<sub>2</sub> isn't like the simulator. Yes, it gets up there real slow. That old H<sub>2</sub> - Stand by for another Master Alarm. It banked up there like nothing flat. Okay. They're all back down to -
000:38:20|O|CMP|Before I get the -
000:38:21|O|LMP|- normal.
000:38:22|O|CMP|- TSBs out, can I get P52 ... program start?
000:38:27|O|CDR|Yes. Go ahead.
000:38:28|O|LMP|Yes.
000:38:29|O|CDR|Jettison the cover when it says jettison.
000:38:31|O|CMP|Yes. Optics ...
000:38:34|O|Multiple speakers (onboard)|...
000:38:35|O|CDR|That's the fourth, Jack. Better do that.
000:38:37|O|CMP|Okay. It's all optic tracking. I've done that. Zero ... G&N Power Optics, on, up. Optics Mode, Manual. ... Direct ... High. OHC, Max right.
000:39:01|O|CDR|Okay, do I have a tool there someplace? Can I use an E tool?
000:39:09|O|LMP|...
000:39:11|O|CDR|You got it uncovered?
000:39:13|O|LMP|Got tool E?
000:39:14|O|CDR|Yes, until I get that up for a fit.
000:39:15|O|LMP|Okay, tool E.
000:39:17|O|CDR|Now, Fred, what do you want me to do?
000:39:19|O|LMP|Okay, next - next thing is to - ... back - page - I need to prime the ... fuel valve on. You can't take your eye off it. I got him out the window. Is that it? I got the airglow there.
000:39:43|O|CDR|Okay.
000:39:52|O|LMP|Make sure you get the right one, Jim. Primary Accum -
000:39:54|O|CDR|Yes. I got it - I got - I got my - If I can get my hand down there, I got it made.
000:40:01|O|LMP|Let me know when you turn them on. I only need about 5 percent; I don't need much.
000:40:14|O|CDR|Okay. Coming On.
000:40:17|O|CMP|Good. That's good. Then Off.
000:40:19|O|CDR|Off.
000:40:20|O|LMP|Okay, let me look a minute, here; I have to stabilize.
000:40:23|O|LMP|... up there.
000:40:25|O|CMP|Okay. About one more shot.
000:40:27|O|CDR|Okay, standby.
000:40:29|O|LMP|Easy does it
000:40:31|O|LMP|... slowly, that really ...
000:40:32|O|CDR|Okay, how's that?
000:40:33|O|LMP|That's good. Off.
000:40:35|O|LMP|... back down there ... go to Off.
000:40:38|O|LMP|It's right at 50, though; the hell with it, that's good.
000:40:40|O|CDR|Is it good?
000:40:41|O|LMP|Yes; that's about 49.9.
000:40:45|O|CDR|Okay.
000:40:46|O|LMP|It is definitely Off, right?
000:40:47|O|CDR|Yes.
000:40:49|O|LMP|ECS RAD Control; let me go to Power. Okay, PRIM Glycol To RADs out, Jim; Normal, push - Normal, push in.
000:40:59|O|CDR|Okay.
000:41:03|O|CMP|Oh, I know - Hey, how about giving me - Do I have G&N Power at 8:21?
000:41:07|O|LMP|Yes, sir.
000:41:08|O|CMP|Okay.
000:41:09|O|LMP|You got it.
000:41:10|O|CMP|Okay.
000:41:12|O|CMP|I'll get it ready for you ... stars out there.
000:41:20|O|CMP|I've got a star in the -
000:41:22|O|CDR|Sextant?
000:41:23|O|CMP|- sextant, but I have nothing in the -
000:41:26|O|CDR|Well, it might take awhile to do it with the scanning telescope, because your eyes have to get accustomed to it. It might not be where there are stars.
000:41:36|O|CMP|Well, I've got one in the - I've got one in the -
000:41:40|O|CDR|What star did you pick?
000:41:43|O|CMP|24.
000:41:44|O|CDR|24, that's - Gienah. Is it right on in the sextant?
000:41:52|O|CMP|... it's not.
000:41:54|O|LMP|Okay, while you got the tool and you're over there, Jim, do you think you could get the secondary Rad loop check done?
000:41:59|O|CDR|Yes.
000:42:00|O|LMP|That's the guy way down there, the very -
000:42:04|O|CMP|... -
000:42:05|O|CDR|Well run through it, Jack, and see if you -
000:42:10|O|CMP|...
000:42:14|O|CDR|Mark it ... Okay, Glycol To Radiator, Secondary?
000:42:18|O|CMP|...
000:42:19|O|LMP|Yes, but it's to - RAD Normal. Let me know when. I'll start my watch.
000:42:28|O|CMP|Hey, there - there we go. Now I got stars. I don't think they ... until just now.
000:42:34|O|CDR|Okay, I'm going to take her to Normal now.
000:42:36|O|CMP|Beautiful, gang.
000:42:37|O|LMP|All right.
000:42:39|O|CDR|Oh, I don't know if I did it or not.
000:42:41|O|LMP|You - you turned it?
000:42:42|O|CDR|I don't think so, I think ... not in there.
000:42:44|O|CMP|Spica's right in there, you guys.
000:42:48|O|LMP|Okay.
000:42:50|O|CDR|I - You know, I can get down there good, but I have a hard time -
000:42:54|O|LMP|Well, you'd know if you got the screw in the slot.
000:42:59|O|CDR|Okay, now.
000:43:01|O|LMP|Okay. Starting my watch. It's on Secondary.
000:43:03|O|CDR|No, it's Normal now.
000:43:04|O|LMP|Okay, you've got to leave it there for 30 seconds.
000:43:06|O|CDR|Okay. Could you tell?
000:43:11|O|LMP|What's that?
000:43:12|O|CDR|Could you tell?
000:43:13|O|LMP|Tell what?
000:43:14|O|CDR|That I'm in Normal?
000:43:15|O|LMP|Yes.
000:43:26|O|CMP|... Good old Antares.
000:43:33|O|LMP|Hey, that's it; put it back to close or off or wherever it -
000:43:36|O|CDR|Bypass.
000:43:37|O|LMP|Bypass. Good. Back to Bypass?
000:43:40|O|CDR|Back to Bypass.
000:43:41|O|LMP|Well, he didn't show anything ... -
000:43:43|O|CDR|Okay, how is it? Okay?
000:43:44|O|CMP|Yes. Looks good.
000:43:46|O|LMP|Okay, I'm on page 2-14; coming up to EPS monitor check -
000:43:50|O|CDR|Okay, just be sure you -
000:43:51|O|LMP|- EPS. Checking them off.
000:43:53|O|CDR|Check them all off, and their time -
000:43:56|O|LMP|You got to do a GDC align -
000:43:58|O|CDR|I'll do that right now.
000:43:59|O|LMP|You've got the sequence camera bracket and the ORDEAL, right?
000:44:02|O|CDR|And those are all mounted, and we're all running on -
000:44:04|O|LMP|Okay, ORDEAL -
000:44:05|O|CMP|Hey, guys? Sorry.
000:44:07|O|LMP|...
000:44:08|O|CDR|Zero. Okay, better record this down ... -
000:44:10|O|CMP|I ain't got - I ain't going to let that pass, man -
000:44:13|O|CDR|No?
000:44:14|O|CMP|- ... triangle bigger than hell.
000:44:15|O|CDR|I'll give you a gold - gold star.
000:44:19|O|LMP|You going to write all that in your book, Jack?
000:44:21|O|CMP|Yes. I'm going to write it on a ... here.
000:44:22|O|LMP|Okay.
000:44:23|O|CDR|I'll do a GDC align now, Fred.
000:44:25|O|LMP|Okay. Now I'm here, I'm going to go ahead and pumping up the secondary loop. Okay, Secondary Loop is coming on line, gang; AC-1 -
000:44:37|O|CMP|Okay. Do we have to wait for MSFN to torque this?
000:44:40|O|LMP|That's that little extra whining you hear, and it's the Secondary Loop.
000:44:43|O|CDR|Okay.
000:44:46|O|LMP|Okay. ... go to the ...
000:44:49|O|CDR|I can see the sludges in the APS burn.
000:44:53|O|LMP|Yes.
000:44:56|O|CMP|Damn! Sort of lost him.
000:45:01|O|LMP|Okay. So that one is done, done -
000:45:04|O|CMP|Okay -
000:45:05|O|LMP|- done, done, done to there -
000:45:06|O|CMP|Jim?
000:45:07|O|CDR|Stand by.
000:45:08|O|CMP|Do I need a - to get MSFN? I don't need them to torque here, do I?
000:45:13|O|CDR|I don't think so - Wait - Where are the torquing angles ...?
000:45:16|O|CMP|I've got the torquing angles; let's see - ... - and it's 0.162 which is quite a bit less than - ...
000:45:40|O|LMP|Okay, Jack, did you ever get my Main B breaker in down there?
000:45:44|O|CMP|Yes, I did, in your COAS?
000:45:45|O|LMP|Yes.
000:45:46|O|CMP|Main B? I did.
000:45:47|O|LMP|Yes. That's right.
000:45:48|O|CMP|That's done.
000:45:49|O|LMP|And - let me verify that the RADs and REACS CB sticks are out, and - off.
000:45:53|O|CMP|Okay. ...
000:45:56|O|LMP|Okay. I'll verify the Main Bus Ties are Off -
000:45:59|O|CDR|GDC's aligned. 46 now. How we doing on the time line, Fred?
000:46:06|O|LMP|Let's see, we're not - we're coming up 6 minutes - What we got to do is get the cameras - get the TV camera out next. We're about fixed.
000:46:18|O|CDR|Okay.
000:46:19|O|LMP|01:05 is when I got to start playing with the TV.
000:46:22|O|CDR|Okay.
000:46:23|O|LMP|After we get our HSK LOS.
000:46:26|O|CMP|Star alignment is just beautiful.
000:46:28|O|CDR|If you have time, I would suggest that you adjust your straps and strap it in again for TLI - just to make sure you got them okay.
000:46:40|O|LMP|Okay. Still pressing on in here, and Jack's got to do that ...; I'll circle it.
000:46:47|O|CMP|Okay, what do you have to do?
000:46:48|O|LMP|The RADs and REAC breakers, six of them, out ...
000:46:55|O|CMP|RAD, REAC, REAC, REAC - Okay, I can verify three RADs and three REACs out.
000:47:03|O|LMP|Okay, good show.
000:47:17|O|LMP|Main A-1 - Main A-2 -
000:47:34|O|LMP|Okay. Bus voltage ...
000:47:43|O|CDR|And, Jack, you want to put tool E down there on the handhold - toward the handhold?
000:47:47|O|LMP|Yes. I haven't got ...
000:47:50|O|CMP|Yes. I think I can get closer than that and ...
000:47:53|O|CDR|Yes, that's right ...
000:47:56|O|LMP|Okay.
000:47:59|O|CDR|Okay, I've got the horizon out there and I've got the airglow layer ...
000:48:12|O|LMP|Okay, and we got the relay bus selected ... - I got to get this TSB ... Okay, item 15's done. And that makes one outstanding item, and I've got a couple from a few pages back.
000:48:31|O|CDR|Okay.
000:48:32|O|LMP|Right there. Unstow and mount TSBs - they're in A-1. ... down below. Hey, where do these - these guys go? They go right in the pocket of this L-shaped bag, don't they?
000:48:47|O|CMP|... water wings.
000:48:51|O|CDR|I thought they went right behind you.
000:48:53|O|LMP|Right there - Yes.
000:48:54|O|CDR|Oh, yes. ... pockets.
000:48:59|O|LMP|Okay. I'm up to ECS monitor - ... look good - H<sub>2</sub> flow - ...
000:49:20|O|CDR|I got it.
000:49:26|O|CDR|Okay, I ought to be getting down there - ... How you doing, Jack?
000:49:34|O|CMP|Good. Hey, how about that - Do you need - that Secondary RAD valve?
000:49:41|O|CDR|I got it.
000:49:42|O|CMP|You got it already; okay.
000:49:43|O|CDR|We got the secondary - we made the secondary check; the filters finally came out a little bit -
000:49:46|O|LMP|You did the ...
000:49:48|O|CDR|- and the ORDEAL's already out; the COAS is -
000:49:50|O|CMP|You got it running?
000:49:51|O|CDR|- ... little COAS ...
000:49:55|O|CMP|Hey, Freddo? Got that TSB. Okay?
000:49:58|O|LMP|... We're going to need it.
000:49:59|O|CMP|Jim, do you need a TSB?
000:50:02|O|CDR|... a big one. Let's see; where did we stow TSBs? We want to ...
000:50:11|O|LMP|Here it is.
000:50:17|O|CDR|Jack, whenever you get time, if you - want to slow down a little bit, well, just come back and we'll take these lifevests off and get this stowed out of the way.
000:50:26|O|CMP|Okay. I'll be ready to do it whenever you -
000:50:46|O|CDR|Why don't you get one of them in -
000:50:53|O|LMP|How you doing, Jack? Feeling all right down there?
000:50:56|O|CMP|Oh, yes. No problems yet. ... kind of worried ... 12.1 down ...
000:51:00|O|CMP|Jim, do you need a TSB?
000:51:07|O|CDR|Well, I wouldn't worry about it now. ... go down yet. You're not getting those breakers; that's what you're forgetting.
000:51:16|O|CMP|The - Okay, now where - those - you want those where?
000:51:20|O|LMP|In front of the L-shaped bag, isn't it?
000:51:21|O|CDR|In front of the L-shaped bag is - Why don't you go down there and help him?
000:51:25|O|LMP|Wait a minute, Jack; you don't go - I don't think you go that way to get through.
000:51:28|O|CDR|I think you come right down here, Jack, but - Yes, there is - there's a ... -
000:51:31|O|CMP|Yes, but that's a long, long way to go.
000:51:32|O|CDR|- there's a ...
000:51:34|O|CMP|Okay, you do that - and I'm going to get the Hasselblad out for - Fred.
000:51:38|O|CDR|Okay, now, if my - my hand controller is locked and yours is locked - I'll tell you what, if you can help me scootch over here a second -
000:51:45|O|LMP|Yes.
000:51:47|O|CDR|- I'll try and -
000:51:49|O|LMP|Okay, I'll put my ..., Jim.
000:51:51|O|CDR|Okay. Okay.
000:51:54|O|CMP|Okay, I want to go back and see what - I've got to get the TV camera and the Hasselblad out, and -
000:52:00|O|LMP|I think we ought to be having AOS, gang; we've got -
000:52:02|O|CDR|56 seconds.
000:52:04|O|LMP|Okay. I - Let me call them.
000:52:07|P|PAO|This is Mission Control, Houston at 52 minutes. We're standing by now for Acquisition Of Signal and our Network controller reports we've just reacquired the spacecraft over the Carnarvon station.
000:52:11|O|LMP|Look at me, Jack; I show gain.
000:52:13|O|CMP|You show gain?
000:52:14|O|LMP|Yes.
000:52:16|T|CMP|Houston, how do you read 13?
000:52:20|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Loud and clear.
000:52:23|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. Everything is going good. We're proceeding on the time line in good fashion. I've got a P52 done. I can give you the torquing angles.
000:52:33|C|Kerwin|I'm ready for them, Jack.
000:52:35|T|CMP|Okay. Used Noun 26 - stars 26 and 33. The star angle difference was all balls. Noun 93: minus 067, minus all balls, plus 0.162. The time of torquing was 45 minutes, 35 seconds.
000:52:59|C|Kerwin|Ah, well, that sounds marginally acceptable.
000:53:04|T|CMP|For a new CMP, it ain't too bad.
000:53:05|C|Kerwin|Yeah. Okay, 13. We've got nothing for you at the moment. Everything's looking good. We're looking at your data now.
000:54:35|O|LMP|How you doing?
000:54:36|O|CDR|I got ... You got to get it when you're going by.
000:54:39|O|LMP|Okay.
000:54:40|O|CMP|Yes, I've got - got it in my helmet bag right now.
000:54:43|O|CDR|Oh, okay, good.
000:54:49|O|CMP|Boy, I'll tell you, that really bothers me ...
000:54:54|O|CDR|Does it ...? Did you put it over far enough?
000:54:57|O|CMP|Yes, that's where it went - when ... It's looking good ..., and I don't think they jettison until ...
000:55:05|O|CDR|Oh.
000:55:08|O|CMP|Okay. Now I've got to get the TV camera for you, Freddo -
000:55:11|O|CDR|Okay.
000:55:12|O|CMP|- ...
000:55:13|O|CDR|You want to hand me that book, and I'll take a look in it.
000:55:15|O|CMP|Yes. And also see if I've - all the things that I've done, see if I've ... , because I haven't checked them off a couple of places.
000:55:29|O|CMP|Hey, Fred, what do you want first, TV camera?
000:55:32|O|LMP|Yes. Just one more - Let me get through one more - system.
000:55:39|O|CMP|That's off. That ... right down ... on the bulkhead.
000:55:43|O|LMP|You could start doing, you're hooking up the cable. You got to do that part, though. We can't ... right there.
000:55:48|O|CMP|All right. 
000:55:49|O|LMP|And I'll verify the TV power is off, before we move on.
000:55:53|O|CDR|I'm going to go back into the computer ..., Jack; and look at ...
000:55:59|O|CMP|Okay.
000:56:00|O|CDR|...
000:56:02|O|CMP|Freddo, you - How about a bracket?
000:56:04|O|LMP|Well.
000:56:11|O|CMP|Okay, that's ...
000:57:15|P|PAO|This is Mission Control at 57 minutes, 15 seconds. Not much conversation with the crew on this pass over the Carnarvon tracking station. Jack Swigert reported that the platform had been aligned as called for in the Flight Plan. There's not a great deal of activity scheduled in the Flight Plan at this time. Flight Director Milton Windler has checked the status with his flight controllers and CapCom Joe Kerwin will be passing that up to the crew shortly.
000:58:10|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. LOS Carnarvon in about 30 seconds. Honeysuckle on the hour, and verify your S-band is up for Honeysuckle. Over.
000:58:21|T|LMP|That's verified.
000:58:23|C|Kerwin|Roger.
000:58:24|T|CDR|And, Houston, we're beginning to see a beautiful sunrise here.
000:58:29|C|Kerwin|Roger that, Jim.
000:59:16|P|PAO|We've had Loss Of Signal now with the spacecraft through Carnarvon. Apollo 13 will be coming within range of the tracking antennas at the Honeysuckle Creek, Australia station in less then a minute. We'll stand by for reacquiring.
001:00:09|P|PAO|And at 1 hour, 10 minutes into the flight of Apollo 13, we should be reacquiring radio contact with the spacecraft through Honeysuckle Creek momentarily. Recapping briefly the situation during the launch: We had a normal first stage burn. The second stage ignition was normal up through 5 minutes and 30 seconds at which time the inboard engine, engine No.5 shut down early. The center engine had been scheduled to shut down at about 7 minutes, 44 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. The cut-off on the second stage was at about 9 minutes, 48 seconds - about 30 seconds early, and the total excess burn time on the third stage was about 10 seconds. CapCom Joe Kerwin has just put in a call to the crew. We've had Acquisition Of Signal. We'll stand by for conversation with the spacecraft.
001:00:51|C|Kerwin|13, Houston through Honeysuckle.
001:01:10|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston through Honeysuckle.
001:01:15|T|CDR|Roger, Houston; 13 here. Reading you loud and clear.
001:01:19|C|Kerwin|Okay. S-band sounds good, Jim.
001:03:21|T|LMP|[Very weak.] Ah, Houston, 13.
001:03:24|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, 13.
001:03:26|T|LMP|Would it be okay if I crank up the FM after we leave Honeysuckle here?
001:03:37|C|Kerwin|You're coming in weak. I didn't quite copy it.
001:03:42|T|LMP|Would it be okay, Joe, if we crank up the FM after we leave Honeysuckle here?
001:03:47|C|Kerwin|Oh. Stand by on that one.
001:04:43|C|Kerwin|13, Houston.
001:04:46|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
001:04:48|C|Kerwin|What TV was that?  Okay, 13 -
001:04:55|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. I just wanted to put on the TV switch at Honeysuckle to tune her up there.
001:05:01|C|Kerwin|Roger. I'm being prompted, and you've got a Go for that. You can turn it on, go to TV, and we'll see you that way over the States.
001:05:10|T|LMP|Okay.
001:05:18|O|CDR|Fred, I'll read the PADs, or you read the PADs, or somebody read the PADs.
001:05:22|O|CMP|Hey, can I get a - a TV ...?
001:05:29|O|LMP|Oh, yes, Jack. LOS Carnarvon.
001:05:35|O|CDR|Okay. 1:45, 75 ... LOS at - ...
001:05:36|C|Kerwin|Okay. 13, Houston. LOS Honeysuckle in about 30 seconds, and we'll see you over the States at 1 plus 28 plus 43.
001:05:51|O|CDR|Okay, coming up. ...
001:05:57|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Did you copy your AOS time?
001:06:07|O|CDR|Fred, I'll get them when we get all relaxed. I'll do that ...
001:06:14|O|CMP|...
001:06:20|O|CDR|Hey, Jack, ...
001:06:25|O|LMP|...
001:06:26|P|PAO|We've had Loss Of Signal now from the spacecraft. At last look, everything appeared to be normal with the spacecraft and the launch vehicle. We currently show an orbit of 103.2 nautical miles - actually, a correction on that, 102.6 by 106.3 [nautical miles, 190.0 by 196.9 km] and our current altitude is 103.2 [191.1 km]. We'll be reacquiring the spacecraft over the United States at a Ground Elapsed Time of 1 minute, 28 seconds, 43 - 28 minutes, 43 seconds at which time you heard the crew advise that they will be configured for the TV transmission, which is scheduled to occur at about 1 minute - 1 hour, 36 minutes over the MILA station. The Post Launch Press Conference is scheduled to begin shortly at Cape Kennedy. At 1 hour, 7 minutes; this is Mission Control, Houston.
001:06:33|O|CMP|Yes, I can - yes, I can do it, Freddo. ...
001:07:28|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> Okay, we're back here at Kennedy Space Center now, and I guess we're ready to proceed. We're going to attempt to conduct this post launch conference between communications with the spacecraft. This gives us approximately some 20 minutes. We'll do our best to try and get as many questions in in that time, but I'll be standing by for a signal also so we can go back to air-ground at the proper time so you can keep up with every phase of the mission. At this point, I'd like to introduce Mr. Walter Kapryan, Director of Launch Operations for the Kennedy Space Center and Launch Director for Apollo missions.
001:08:04|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to see you on a clear day for a change. I guess there really isn't too much to report to you as far as the countdown itself is concerned. It was perfectly nominal. We had no problems whatsoever with the spacecraft, with one exception and that was in that we do have a lock to safe our pyro bus and it takes a key to remove that lock and we broke the darn key off in the lock and it took us a little while to get it out. We did have a spare key and we took that off. And that's the soil and substance of our problems with the spacecraft. At approximately 1 hour and 50 minutes before launch, we did run into a little difficulty with a LOX vent valve on the S-IC stage which we were attempting to cycle; open and close as required for the venting process, and it stuck on us in the full-open position, and we ran through a repeated number of cycles attempting to free it and for some time were unsuccessful in doing so. It caused us concern in that if we had not been able to close the vent valve, we would not have been able to pressurise the LOX tank at T minus 72 seconds. However, we did run some nitrogen gas through the system and we were able to sufficiently raise the temperature such that we were able to close the valve and we proceeded the rest of the way with that vent valve in a closed position at all times and we do have a second vent valve in the stage that we relied on to give us the correct conditions at time of stage pressurisation at T minus 72 seconds. Those two items were the soil and substance of the problems that we encountered during the entire countdown. As most of you know by this time, the first stage burn was perfectly nominal. You may have noticed that it seemed almost like an eternity before the vehicle cleared the tower. That, of course, was because this is the heaviest vehicle that we've flown. It was approximately 26,000 pounds heavier at lift-off than Apollo 12 and the S-IC engines, though they were perfectly within specification, were rated at about 100,000 pounds total thrust less than those that we had on the Apollo 12 vehicle. This made the time about one half to three quarters of a second longer in clearing the tower. All of the first stage burn, as I mentioned earlier, was perfectly nominal. The second stage burn was nominal up until the time that the S-II inboard engine cut off. That engine is normally cut off by switch selector command approximately 90 seconds before the outboard engines are cut off. For some reeason that we have not been able to determine at this time, the engine did cut itself off approximately 2 minutes earlier than planned. Now, as a result of that having happened, the outboard engines of course burned approximately a half a second [means minute] longer; they burned to fuel depletion and made up some of the energy that was lost by virtue of the inboard engine having cut off early, and when we burned the S-IVB, it burned approximately half a minute longer than originally planned in order to make up the deficiency and at the end of the first burn of the S-IVB, the deficiency was made up. Now, we had approximately 2,200-pound payload margin for this mission. We used up a little but of that margin by the fact that the engine did cut off early but we did not use up enough to - to lose any confidence in our ability to perform the TLI manoeuvre. We do still have a 3-sigma capability. So, we have no reason to suspect that we will not have a good TLI burn and fly a perfectly nominal mission from this point on. I guess that's all I have in the way of general comments. Feel free to ask any questions if you choose to.
001:12:53|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> Hey, Dick, right down here.
001:12:57|P|PAO|<b>Newsman:</b> Why did we nominally have main stage engines lower rated in thrust, if I understood you correctly?
001:13:04|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> They weren't - they weren't - Well, you know, the vendor guarantees engine performance to within cer - to a certain specification. These engines did meet that specification. It just so happens they weren't quite as hot as the ones we flew on Apollo 12. There's nothing wrong with them. I don't - I don't mean to imply that. I'm just explaining to you why it took a little longer to clear the tower than it had taken on previous missions.
001:13:31|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> Up there. Go ahead.
001:13:36|P|PAO|<b>Newsman:</b> Does the longer time for the S-IVB burn affect the time lines, or - ?
001:13:41|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> I don't think it affects us significantly. I think we're going to be within seconds. Certainly not more than a minute or two.
001:13:49|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> Question Anderson.
001:13:50|P|PAO|<b>Newsman:</b> Do you have that total lift-off weight, since it was the heaviest, other than 26,000 more than the others?
001:13:56|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> No, I don't. It was - if you recall what Apollo 12 was, add 25,600 pounds to it.
001:14:03|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> That was about 6.4 [million pounds] but we'll check that figure for you. Al, up there. Go ahead. Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead, Reg.
001:14:14|P|PAO|<b>Turnill:</b> You told us there was a 22,000-pound payload margin -
001:14:18|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> 2,200-pound.
001:14:20|P|PAO|<b>Turnill:</b>  - 200, thanks. How much of that margin has been consumed, please?
001:14:24|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> Best we can determine, we used up a significant proportion of that margin. Now, beyond that margin, we still have what we call a 3-sigma capability, so we have the full 3-sigma capability plus somewhat of a margin. Now, at the time I left the firing room, we did not have all of the numbers in yet, telling us exactly how much we had but we did - were able to establish that we still had - we did have the full 3-sigma margin. The 2,200 pounds was something that was a little bit of gravy that we had in addition to that.
001:15:02|P|PAO|<b>Turnill:</b> And is it a fact that you've just got enough for TLI now?
001:15:07|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> Yes. For a 3-sigma condition. In other words, for a worst-case condition. If you put all of your 3-sigma errors together, which is the basis on which we plan our missions, we have enough reserves to handle that.
001:15:19|P|PAO|<b>Turnill:</b> Thank you.
001:15:20|P|PAO|<b>King</b>: We use - we still have margin. We still do have - we have all the margin we wanted to have. We've not used up all our margin or even come close to using it up.
001:15:29|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> We have our full 3-sigma margin.
001:15:32|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> ...
001:15:34|P|PAO|<b>Newsman:</b> On that - on that weight again, what - where are you getting the extra 22,000 pounds? Is that fuel, and if so, located where?
001:15:43|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> The - as far as the margin itself was concerned, well, we flew - we flew with some extra propellants aboard this vehicle. Part of it for the reason of flying this missions and part of it to just get a little bit of added knowledge in - as a preliminary to flying the 'J' missions which are going to be missions where we fly with heavier payloads than we've been flying to this time. So we loaded the tanks up more than was required to fly the mission.
001:16:15|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> Go ahead, ...
001:16:16|P|PAO|<b>Newsman interjection:</b> Does that include -
001:16:16|P|PAO|<b>Newsman:</b> Do you have enough fuel left for the - to guide the S-IVB for the lunar impact?
001:16:23|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> I asked that question when I left the firing room. The best answer I could get at that time was that we should not affect our capability of flying the nominal lunar impact with the S-IVB. In other words, we expect to impact the S-IVB where we planned to.
001:16:45|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> Ed. Over here.
001:16:46|P|PAO|<b>Newsman:</b> Why that's the same question I wanted to ask.
001:16:49|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> Have any over here? Okay, any more hands? Okay, we'll take two over here and then we'll wrap it up.
001:17:00|P|PAO|<b>Newsman:</b> ..., Mattingly was in the control room. Was there no concern about his being infectious with German Measles?
001:17:08|P|PAO|<b>Speaker:</b> He was in the control room in Houston.
001:17:10|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> Mattingly left the cape last night.
001:17:14|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> I think we'd have to - We'll try to find that out for you, Ben, but I don't think we have any details. Ken Mattingly observed the launch from the Mission Control Center in Houston, not here. If you have a question, Andy, go ahead.
001:17:32|P|PAO|<b>Newsman:</b> Could you give us the figures again for the additional burn of the S-II and the S-IVB?
001:17:38|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> Yes, the S-II inboard engine, the center engine cut off 2 minutes and 7 seconds earlier than it was supposed to. As a result of that, the outboard engines burned 33.96, roughly 34 seconds longer than they would have had the inboard engine burned for its proper time. As far as the S-IVB is concerned, the delta in time was about the same; 33.97, roughly 34 seconds longer.
001:18:21|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> Okay, we'll take one here.
001:18:24|P|PAO|<b>Newsman:</b> One last thing about this extra fuel, Walt. Did you have extra fuel in the S-IVB by any chance, as a result of running this weight up and did that give you a little more leeway?
001:18:35|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> Yes, we had some extra fuel in all three stages. We had about the same amount of LOX that we flew on Pete Conrad's mission. We had approximately 9,500 pounds more RP-1 than we had on Apollo 12, and we had more LOX and hydrogen on both the other stages. I knew those figures but I've forgotten them. I can't give them to you.
001:18:57|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> Did that make any difference in the 3-sigma?
001:19:00|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> Well, it helped us out.
001:19:01|P|PAO|<b>Newsman:</b> Okay.
001:19:02|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> All right, we'll take one final one up here.
001:19:04|P|PAO|<b>Newsman:</b> Can we have exact lift-off time please?
001:19:06|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> Let me check here. Here it is. It was 600 milliseconds late.
001:19:33|P|PAO|<b>King:</b>2:13.00.6
001:19:40|P|PAO|<b>King:</b> Okay, thank you very much. That completes the conference. We should be coming back up on acquisition in about 10 minutes.
001:19:48|P|PAO|<b>Kapryan:</b> [Mumbling to PAO.] There's on thing I said that I'm not sure I knew ... what it does to the timeline -
001:28:01|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 1 hour, 28 minutes. We'll be re-establishing radio communications with Apollo 13 in about 40 seconds as the spaceship comes within range of the Guaymas, Mexico tracking station. During the launch phase, the medic reports the following heart rates. These are maximum heart rates for the three crewmen. Commander Jim Lovell had a maximum heart rate during the launch of 116; the Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert had a maximum heart rate of 102; and the Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise also had a maximum heart rate of 102.
001:28:40|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston through Guaymas. Over.
001:28:44|P|PAO|CapCom Joe Kerwin has just put in a call to the crew through Guaymas. We'll stand by.
001:29:31|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston through Guaymas. Over.
001:29:55|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston

001:31:09|T|CMP|Go ahead.
001:31:10|C|Kerwin|Hello there. We thought you were still up there.
001:31:13|T|CMP|And we're just coming up on Baja, and I've got the TV on. Do you want it?
001:31:18|C|Kerwin|I don't think we require it just yet, Jack, but we'll command it when we're ready. I believe they are dumping the tape now. The booster looks good. The spacecraft looks good on the few minutes' data we've had.
001:31:31|T|CMP|That sounds good.
001:31:40|T|CMP|Jim finally let me look out.
001:31:41|C|Kerwin|(Laughter) How do you like it?
001:31:52|T|CMP|Chained me to the LEB down there stowing things and unstowing things, and I finally got a chance to look out and see the world.
001:32:03|P|PAO|That was Jack Swigert reporting, apparently his first view out the windows.
001:32:16|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. I have the TLI plus 90, and lift-off plus 8 PADs whenever you're ready.
001:32:35|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead with the TLI PAD, Joe.

001:34:41|T|CMP|Joe, we had a dropout of signal there about midway or about a fifth of the start of your PAD, and Fred didn't get it. We'd like you to start over again. Could you please?
001:34:52|C|Kerwin|Sure thing. You want the whole thing?

001:37:22|T|LMP|Okay. It's set to TV.
001:37:23|C|Kerwin|Okay. We're not getting a signal.
001:37:25|T|CMP|Okay. I'll go to Transmit, Joe.

001:38:42|T|LMP|Okay. Sextant star 26 and 15.54.
001:38:46|C|Kerwin|Roger. And we have a picture now; however, it's moving around quite a bit, if you could hold the camera a little steadier. And I have your -
001:38:54|T|LMP|- Okay, Joe. There's nothing but clouds outside, and when we get some land down there coming up, I'll switch back to the window, I thought I'd just show you Jim here, to make sure he's still here.
001:39:08|C|Kerwin|Okay; real fine. We had a good picture of Jim there for a minute. I have the Lift-off plus 8 PAD, Fred. If you're ready.
001:39:17|T|LMP|Go ahead, Joe.

001:41:18|C|Kerwin|Roger, Fred. Readback correct, and we're getting a nice color TV picture now. If you have any commentary to go with it.
001:41:31|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. I'll tell you, I'm just trying to figure out where we are here.
001:41:40|C|Kerwin|That's your job, not mine.
001:41:43|T|CMP|... You know, I've just been up out of the LEB for a short time here, and I'm trying to find out which country we're over.
001:41:52|T|CDR|I have to keep telling Jack that the blue stuff down there is water.
001:41:56|C|Kerwin|I'll give you a hint. You're in the western hemisphere.
001:42:10|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. It appears like that we've crossed out into the Gulf of Mexico here, and I've got a peninsula or an island that's down there. I don't know whether you can see it.
001:42:34|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jack. We see that. Of course, there's a lot of cloud cover and you see it more clearly than we do, but it does look like the Earth, not the Moon.
001:42:58|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. We've had LOS MILA now. Thank you very much.
001:43:04|P|PAO|Off the southern coast of the United States, but we'll stay with it and perhaps we'll get a picture in a moment or -
001:43:48|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. Request P00 and Accept for a state vector. Over.
001:43:53|T|CDR|Roger, Houston. We're in P00 and Accept.
001:43:56|C|Kerwin|Okay.
001:48:08|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
001:48:10|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
001:48:11|C|Kerwin|Okay. The computer is yours, Jim.
001:48:14|T|CDR|Thank you, going to BLOCK.
001:48:16|C|Kerwin|And you are Go for TLI. Huntsville reports that you have a 6-second propellant pad which is 3 seconds more than a 3-sigma case; so you're good on consumables. The IU is so good that we're not going to update it. The only change we have for you is in the TLI checklist. At 57 minutes, where you slew the FDAI to 18 degrees, we recommend 20 degrees there, and we recommend that you look for 8 degrees instead of 6 degrees at ignition. The S-IVB is riding on the top of its deadband.
001:48:56|T|CDR|Understand; and just out of curiosity, was that engine-out to use up more S-IVB fuel?
001:49:03|C|Kerwin|The engine-out did cause you to use more S-IVB fuel - about a 10-second-longer burn; but you're still Go.
001:49:12|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
001:49:21|C|Kerwin|And, 13, Houston. We're ready to support pyro arm and docking probe extension whenever you're ready.
001:49:36|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Docking probe has been extended and all indications are nominal. We're down to Pyro Arm now and we're getting ready.
001:49:47|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim.
001:49:58|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. My circuit breaker's armed - or closed; Sequential Logic, two, on and up and we're standing by ...
001:50:06|C|Kerwin|Okay, 13. You're Go for pyro arm.
001:50:28|P|PAO|We've Loss Of Signal now with the spacecraft through the Vanguard Tracking Ship; we'll be reacquiring at Canary Islands in just a few minutes.
001:50:40|T|CDR|And, Houston, 13. Were you reading us?
001:50:43|C|Kerwin|Roger, 13. Go ahead.
001:50:47|T|CDR|Roger. We have our Sequential Arm circuit breakers in and our Sequential Logic, two, on and up and we are just standing by for your confirmation for a Go.
001:50:56|C|Kerwin|Sorry, 13. You didn't copy. You are Go for pyro arm. Over.
001:51:00|T|CDR|Okay; fine. Thank you.
001:53:21|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
001:53:24|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
001:53:26|C|Kerwin|About 2&frac12; minutes to LOS, Jim, and your AOS at Carnarvon will be 2 plus 25 plus 50. Over.
001:53:41|T|CDR|Roger. AOS at Carnarvon 2 plus 25 plus 50.
001:53:45|C|Kerwin|That's affirm.
001:54:57|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. LOS in about 1 minute. At LOS we'd like Command Reset and then Normal.
001:55:05|T|CDR|Roger.
001:56:42|P|PAO|We've lost contact now with the spacecraft through the Canary Islands Tracking Station. We'll be reacquiring in a little less than 30 minutes, at a Ground Elapsed Time of 2 hours, 26 minutes; when the spacecraft comes within range of the tracking antennas at Carnarvon Australia. During the pass over the United States, and out over the Atlantic, CapCom Joe Kerwin gave the crew a preliminary go ahead for Translunar Injection. We have adequate propellant margins on the Saturn third stage, and despite the some 10 seconds of additional burn in getting into orbit due to the early shutdown of the second stage center engine. It is not expected that the somewhat later injection time will have any significant effect on the Flight Plan; the preliminary time for the beginning of the Translunar Injection burn is 2 hours, 35 minutes, 27 seconds. The Flight Dynamics Officer is in the process now of updating that time but we don't expect a significant change. At 1 hour, 57 minutes, 55 seconds; this is Mission Control, Houston.
002:24:58|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 2 hours, 25 minutes. Apollo 13 is now about 10 minutes away from the scheduled ignition of the S-IVB engine to start the spacecraft on its way to the Moon. The Flight Dynamics Officer advises that the planned time for the beginning of that burn will be 2 hours and 35 minutes, 44 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. Our network controller reports that we've just had Acquisition Of Signal with the spacecraft from Carnarvon and during this pass, flight controllers will be looking at the spacecraft and the launch vehicle - the S-IVB - one last time before Translunar Injection.
002:25:38|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston through Carnarvon.
002:25:41|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. Read you loud and clear. We're sitting here monitoring time base 6. You can see countdown; we're 20 seconds away.
002:25:49|C|Kerwin|Okay. We're just starting to get data, and everything still looks good to us.
002:25:53|T|CMP|Hey, Joe. At 2 hours and 12 minutes, the O<sub>2</sub> Flow High light came on, and it's been pegged high ever since, so it's been on about 14 minutes now.
002:26:04|C|Kerwin|Roger, 13. We're looking at it.
002:26:09|T|CDR|Time base 6.
002:26:12|C|Kerwin|Copy. Time base 6.
002:26:52|C|Kerwin|Okay. Apollo 13, Houston. You have a Go for all systems, and the O<sub>2</sub> Flow High check is nominal with the Waste Tank Vent open at this time, and it's no sweat.
002:27:05|T|CMP|Okay. Just wanted you all to check it for me.
002:27:08|C|Kerwin|Okay. We did.
002:27:11|T|CMP|Thank you.
002:29:44|P|PAO|The crew is rather quiet at this time, preparing for that Translunar Injection burn. The burn again scheduled to begin at 2 hours, 35 minutes, 44 seconds. The predicted duration of the burn is 5 minutes, 47 seconds and we expect that the spacecraft and S-IVB will accelerate some 10,417 feet per second [3,175 m/s] as a result of that maneuver. We will not get data from the burn and we'll be out of acquisition with the spacecraft at the time the maneuver occurs. Three ARIA aircraft, Apollo Range Instrumented Aircraft, are stationed in the ground track off the coast of Australia underneath the point on Earth where the Translunar Injection burn will be occurring. They'll be recording data from it which we could play back somewhat later if necessary. The booster engineer's just reported that the S-IVB chilldown in preparation for the burn has begun.
002:31:22|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. We'll be losing data from Carnarvon in about 1 minute. We'll probably have voice through ARIA. Everything is hunky-dory, and we'll be listening for you to tell us how the burn goes.
002:31:34|T|CDR|Okay, this is 13. We're standing by, too.
002:33:13|P|PAO|We've had Loss Of Signal now through Canarvon. And CapCom Joe Kerwin has just put on a call through one of the ARIA aircraft.
002:33:14|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston through ARIA. Just a comm check. Over.
002:33:20|T|CDR|Reading you clear, all the way you've been clear.
002:33:26|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. It's not the best, but we're reading you.
002:33:30|T|CDR|Roger.
002:34:16|P|PAO|We expect communications will continue to be somewhat noisy during the time that conversation from the spacecraft is being relayed through the ARIA aircraft. As mentioned before, we will not see the telemetry data on the burn. We do hope to get voice reports on the progress of the maneuver from the crew. We are now just a little more than one minute away from the scheduled beginning of that burn.
002:34:28|O|CMP|... now?
002:34:30|O|LMP|...
002:34:32|O|CMP|... 59 - ...
002:34:49|O|CDR|What was this ...?

002:35:53|C|Kerwin|Copy that, Jim. Good deal.
002:35:56|O|CMP|Okay. ... pitching her down a little bit, right here.
002:36:00|O|CDR|... There you go.
002:36:02|P|PAO|Jim Lovell reports that we have ignition.
002:36:04|O|CMP|... Is that all right?
002:36:05|O|CDR|Okay, you watch the - trajectory thrust?
002:36:09|O|CMP|Yes.
002:36:20|P|PAO|Lovell's report would indicate we had a very close to on-time ignition. A total burn duration should be about 5 minutes, 47 seconds.
002:36:25|O|CMP|... burned 14-second velocity V<sub>I</sub> and ...
002:36:46|O|CDR|...?
002:36:47|O|CMP|It's right on V<sub>I</sub>; we're right on V<sub>I</sub>.

002:37:35|O|CMP|...
002:37:37|O|CDR|Watch the ...
002:37:44|O|LMP|Okay, Jim, it's 2 minutes ...
002:37:52|T|CDR|Everything's okay so far.
002:37:56|C|Kerwin|Houston; Roger.
002:38:06|O|CMP|Okay; we got 02:30 coming ..., Jim?
002:38:09|P|PAO|Jim Lovell just reported that everything looks good with that burn. We're still about 7 minutes away from reacquiring the spacecraft through the station in Hawaii at which time we'll get our first good look at the trajectory as a result of this burn.
002:38:17|O|CMP|Right on ... Right on H-dot; we're right on 8.
002:38:27|T|LMP|They are off - at 38.
002:38:31|O|CMP|Three minutes - 
002:38:47|O|CMP|...
002:38:48|O|CDR|All right.
002:39:02|O|CMP|3:30, Jim. 3.4.
002:39:06|O|CDR|3.4. Okay.
002:39:13|P|PAO|We're now 3&frac12; minutes into the Translunar Injection burn. Some 2 minutes, 17 seconds remaining in the maneuver which will start Apollo 13 en route to the Moon.
002:39:17|O|CMP|Okay. We're right on.
002:39:19|O|CDR|Okay. ...
002:39:27|O|CMP|Okay, at 4 minutes. ...
002:39:36|O|LMP|...?
002:39:38|O|CDR|Okay.
002:39:42|O|CDR|Okay, we'll hold this down; we've got a little vibration.
002:39:45|O|LMP|...
002:39:47|O|CDR|Yes.
002:39:57|O|CDR|No, ... thousand, 200 ...
002:40:06|O|Multiple speakers (onboard)|...
002:40:07|O|CMP|We're looking at 4 point ... -
002:40:09|O|CDR|4 point ..., okay.
002:40:16|O|CMP|Right on at 30. A little bit high.
002:40:26|T|CDR|And, Houston, we're noticing a little vibration during this burn.
002:40:28|C|Kerwin|Houston; Roger.
002:40:37|O|LMP|Five minutes ... 4.6.
002:40:41|O|CDR|Okay.
002:40:46|O|CMP|... a hundred ...
002:40:50|O|CDR|Okay.
002:40:51|O|CMP|H-dot is a little high ...
002:40:54|O|CDR|Okay.
002:40:59|O|LMP|5:30 - 5 point - ... the same countdown, Jack, and then start counting up.
002:41:06|O|CMP|Okay.
002:41:07|O|LMP|...
002:41:08|O|CMP|... V<sub>I</sub> ...
002:41:11|P|PAO|Now about 20 seconds away from the scheduled shutdown time. Jim Lovell reported a few moments ago that that they're experiencing a bit of vibration on the S-IVB. Previous crews have also reported a similiar experience toward the end of the burn.
002:41:11|O|CDR|...
002:41:15|O|LMP|Five seconds.
002:41:16|O|CMP|Five ..., okay.
002:41:19|O|CDR|Better get ...

002:41:28|O|CDR|5 -
002:41:29|O|LMP|4, 3, 2, 1 - 1, 2, 3, 4 -
002:41:34|O|LMP|Okay.
002:41:38|O|CDR|Engine Off. ...
002:41:39|O|LMP|... is three-quarter overburn.
002:41:40|T|CDR|It's off. Engine off.
002:41:42|C|Kerwin|Houston. Copy. Engine off.
002:41:44|O|LMP|Freeze the DSKY.
002:41:45|O|CMP|I did.
002:41:46|O|LMP|Okay, and  now we'll ...
002:41:49|O|LMP|Okay, Jim, it's SCS TVC Servo Power 1, Off.
002:41:52|O|CDR|It's Off.
002:41:53|O|LMP|PCM Bit Rate, I got Low. EMS Mode - Wait, let Jack get it. Minus 3.0.
002:41:57|O|CMP|Boy, beautiful.
002:41:58|O|LMP|You got that, Jack?
002:41:59|O|CMP|Yes.
002:42:00|O|LMP|EMS Mode to Standby?
002:42:01|O|CMP|...
002:42:03|O|CDR|EMS Mode to Standby.
002:42:04|O|LMP|Standby. Function, Off.
002:42:06|O|CDR|Function, Off.
002:42:07|O|LMP|Sequence Pyro Arm, two, Safe.
002:42:08|O|CDR|Sequence Pyro Arm, two, Safe.
002:42:09|O|CMP|That's a ..., too.
002:42:12|O|CDR|Okay.
002:42:17|O|LMP|Okay. Sequence - FDAI 1, Inertial.
002:42:20|O|CDR|FDAI 1 going Inertial.
002:42:22|O|LMP|And lock your hand controller.
002:42:23|P|PAO|Lovell's report of engine-on came about five or six seconds after the preplanned time.
002:42:24|O|CDR|Handcontroller is locked.
002:42:25|O|LMP|Okay, Jack, you clean up the DSKY and eventually get the P00.
002:42:27|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. We'll have you through Hawaii in 3 minutes.
002:42:31|T|CDR|Roger. Through Hawaii in 3 minutes.
002:42:33|O|LMP|Okay.
002:42:34|O|CMP|Okay -
002:42:35|O|LMP|So we're standing by until Jack gets through that - jazz -
002:42:38|O|CDR|How does that look, Jack?
002:42:40|O|CMP|Looks good.
002:42:44|P|PAO|Our communications continuing to come to us relayed through the ARIA aircraft. CapCom Joe Kerwin advised Lovell and the Apollo 13 crew that we'll be reacquiring a little less than three minutes from now through Hawaii at which time we should get good solid S-band communications and also our first look at the trajectory of Apollo 13 following the burn.
002:42:45|O|LMP|Okay,  it's a Verb 66 Enter, Jack, after you get - after you get the P00. Wait until you get that.
002:42:52|O|CMP|...
002:42:57|O|LMP|Okay, now you all switch - En route, Jack, you got to do a couple of things.
002:43:07|O|CDR|In Hawaii, we'll get their ... -
002:43:12|O|CMP|Okay. You - let me put this - put this up under here -
002:43:17|O|LMP|Okay.
002:43:18|O|CDR|And we'll have to switch comm carriers so I can take this suit stuff off.
002:43:20|O|LMP|Yes. We'll have to take the suit power off.
002:43:23|O|CDR|Yes. And we'll -
002:43:24|O|LMP|And what would be nice for you to do, Jack, if you can -
002:43:27|O|CMP|Okay. What do you want me to do?
002:43:28|O|LMP|-  is, first of all, Waste Stowage Vent valve, Closed.
002:43:32|O|CMP|Okay. I'll do that right now.
002:43:38|O|LMP|I've got the High Gain Power, Off, and I'm getting - I've got those two breakers in on 225. Waste Stowage Vent valve is Closed.
002:43:44|O|CMP|Closed.
002:43:45|O|LMP|Now, get the TV camera out from under there, will you?
002:43:47|O|CMP|Okay.
002:43:48|O|LMP|And I'll be dickering with that -
002:43:51|O|CMP|Okay, Freddo.
002:43:52|O|LMP|...
002:43:54|O|CMP|TV camera's -
002:43:57|O|LMP|Thank you. May as well get me the monitor and all that jazz.
002:44:00|O|CMP|I'll go do that now.
002:44:02|O|LMP|And the bracket. I'll be fiddling and getting this baby ready.
002:44:06|O|CMP|One bracket.
002:44:08|O|LMP|Thank you.
002:44:08|P|PAO|Our communications is getting quite noisy at this point through the ARIA relay. Lovell's reports of ignition and engine shutdown would indicate that the burn went at least fairly close to nominal. He reported engine shutdown about six seconds following the time that the engine was scheduled to shut down. And we'll be reacquiring at Hawaii in about 45 seconds.
002:44:27|O|CMP|Okay, Freddo, now here's the monitor.
002:44:37|O|LMP|Okay. Got a - Thank you. Okay. ...
002:44:53|O|LMP|Okay. Okay. The ... are off - done.
002:45:14|O|CDR|Stand by. ...
002:45:17|P|PAO|We have had Acquisition Of Signal at Hawaii, we'll stand by for a call to the crew.
002:45:21|O|CMP|It's funny.
002:45:25|O|CDR|Okay, my Suit Power's going Off -
002:45:29|O|CDR|- ... you got comm -
002:45:30|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston through Hawaii. Over.
002:45:32|O|CDR|Roger, Houston.
002:45:34|T|CDR|13 through Hawaii. How do you read?
002:45:38|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. You're weak but clear; it'll probably get better in a second. We're standing by for the burn report.
002:45:42|O|CDR|Roger.
002:45:43|O|CDR|Jack, we need the burn report just briefly.
002:45:45|O|CMP|Okay.
002:45:46|O|LMP|Here, I'll get it.
002:46:01|C|Kerwin|And 13, Houston. The Booster reports that everything looks good with the S-IV.
002:46:08|T|CDR|Sounds good, Houston. The ride was very nominal. We a little vibration, though, during most of the run.
002:46:15|C|Kerwin|Okay. We copied your call on that, Jim.
002:46:19|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. The DSKY read 35560, plus 04445, plus 01769, and Delta-V<sub>C</sub> was minus 3.0.
002:46:37|C|Kerwin|Roger. You can't ask for much better than that. How about the burn time? Did you notice?
002:46:42|T|LMP|Okay. On my trusty watch, I had about 3&frac34; seconds long.
002:46:49|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that.
002:48:34|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
002:48:38|T|CDR|Roger, Houston; 13 here.
002:48:39|C|Kerwin|Okay. We have the S-IVB maneuver to Sep attitude commencing at 2 plus 56 plus 37. Duration of the maneuver: 4 minutes. Sep time, 3 plus 06 plus 37. Over.
002:49:15|T|LMP|Okay. If I heard those right, Joe, that the S-IVB maneuver was 2 plus 56 plus 57, and Sep time is 3 plus 06 plus 27.
002:49:25|C|Kerwin|Correction on the seconds; 2 plus 56 plus 37, and 3 plus 06 plus 37.
002:49:43|T|LMP|Okay. 2 plus 56 plus 37 with the maneuver time; and the Sep time, 3 plus 06 plus 27?
002:49:53|C|Kerwin|That's plus 37, too. Exactly 10 minutes later, Fred.
002:50:00|T|LMP|Okay; 37.
002:53:37|P|PAO|This is Mission Control; we're now at 2 hours, 54 minutes with the crew, and preparing for the CSM separation from the S-IVB; the subsequent docking with the Lunar Module and the ejection of the LM and Command Module from the Saturn third stage. The times of all of those events are almost precisely as indicated in the Flight Plan. The separation maneuver scheduled to occur at Ground Elapsed Time of 3 hours, 6 minutes, 37 seconds; and the docking would come then with the LM at 3 hours, 16 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Our displays in Mission Control are showing the effects of the Translunar Injection burn; we currently show the spacecraft at an altitude of 1,183 nautical miles [2,191 km], traveling at a velocity of 31,406 feet per second [9,573 metres/second].
002:57:52|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
002:57:54|T|CDR|Go ahead.
002:57:57|C|Kerwin|We see the booster doing all the right things, and FIDO says your trajectory looks good, and it looks like we'll stick with a pretty close to nominal midcourse, too. We'll have some numbers for you later.
002:58:02|T|CDR|Okay. And we concur. The S-IVB is maneuvering at this time.
002:58:13|C|Kerwin|Roger.
002:58:32|C|Kerwin|And, Apollo 13, Houston. We'd like Omni Alpha. Over.
002:58:36|T|CDR|Omni Alpha, coming up.
002:59:54|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Now request Omni Charlie.
002:59:56|T|CDR|Roger. Going Charlie.
003:00:06|C|Kerwin|And, 13, we'll be doing a handover, now.
003:00:09|T|CDR|Okay.
003:00:59|P|PAO|And our booster engineer reports the S-IVB is nearly in the proper attitude. We're about 5&frac12; minutes from the scheduled time of separation, and we are expecting that the crew will have the television transmitter and camera on, beginning at a Ground Elapsed Time of about 3 hours, 15 minutes for television coverage of the docking.
003:01:33|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. You are Go for T&amp;D.
003:01:37|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. Thank you.
003:01:44|C|Kerwin|And, 13, Houston. Check your Noun 17 for extraction pitch attitude. It should be 319 degrees. Over.
003:01:52|T|CDR|Okay. We'll look at it.
003:05:20|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; 13. Do we have a Go for pyro arm?
003:05:31|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Affirmative. You're Go for pyro arm, and recommend you secure the cabin pressurization.
003:05:39|T|CMP|We did. We closed the waste management vent valve, there. Or waste stowage valves -
003:05:48|C|Kerwin|Okay. We're reading 6 psi on the cabin, Jack.
003:05:55|T|CMP|Roger, Joe. Thank you very much.
003:07:01|P|PAO|Telemetry data, here on the ground, indicates that the spacecraft has separated from the S-IVB. Astronaut, Jack Swigert at this time would be in the commander's couch, the left-hand couch, at the controls of the spacecraft during the transposition and docking maneuvers. And we should be getting television transmissions from the spacecraft, beginning at about 3 hours, 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time.
003:07:38|T|CMP|Yeah, that's quite a bang, Joe. We've separated, and we've pitched around about 60 degrees now.
003:07:44|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jack. We see you pitching.
003:07:47|T|CMP|Okay. We got the SLA panels; one of them is out front now.
003:07:52|C|Kerwin|Ah, so.
003:07:58|P|PAO|Swigert reporting that the SLA panels on the S-IVB are coming into view.
003:08:38|T|CMP|Got the S-IVB. I guess we're about 80 feet.
003:08:42|C|Kerwin|Good deal.
003:09:01|T|LMP|Okay. I'm going to come on with the TV now, Joe.
003:09:03|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. We're waiting for it.
003:09:20|P|PAO|The network controller reports we're getting television signals now from the spacecraft, a bit earlier than expected and the crew is apparently somewhat ahead of the timeline in the Transposition and Docking maneuver. We'll stand by for a television picture.
003:09:52|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. We've got a groovy TV picture.
003:09:57|T|CDR|Sounds good.
003:10:30|P|PAO|We're looking down the nose of the S-IVB minus its SLA panels at this time, the top view of the LM. That last report Swigert said they were 80 feet away from the S-IVB and that distance should be closing.
003:11:25|T|LMP|Is the focus good enough, Joe, that you can see all the glittering debris?
003:11:32|C|Kerwin|We've seen some debris, Fred. The booster itself is a little bit bright. What's your f-stop?
003:11:40|T|LMP|Okay. I'm at 22.
003:11:41|C|Kerwin|Why don't you go up a click and let us have a look at that.
003:11:50|T|LMP|Okay. You're at 44 now.
003:11:55|C|Kerwin|Okay. Let's stay there for now and I assume you're in peak.
003:11:58|T|LMP|Affirmed.
003:12:17|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Recommend Rate 2 on the BMAGs.
003:12:24|T|CMP|Thank you.
003:12:36|P|PAO|Fred Haise is manipulating the TV camera. We haven't determined yet which window of the Command Module we're looking out of. Jack Swigert in the left hand couch maneuvering the spacecraft, the Command Module, into position for the docking.
003:13:23|C|Kerwin|It's getting bigger.
003:13:42|T|CDR|As you might know, Joe, I've got the center seat, again and I can't see a thing.
003:13:47|C|Kerwin|Too bad.
003:13:49|T|LMP|I gave him the TV monitor.
003:14:01|P|PAO|This view of the Saturn third stage and the Lunar Module is coming to us from about 5,000 [nautical] miles [9,000 km] beyond Earth. The spacecraft and S-IVB travelling at a speed of about 22,900 feet per second [7,000 m/s] at this time.
003:15:04|T|LMP|Okay, I'm going to be moving the TV directly. I'm going to pull it out of this bracket, Jim.
003:15:10|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Did you call?
003:15:12|T|LMP|Rog. I'll be moving the TV to get a better shot here; moving it out of this bracket.
003:15:18|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. It's just beginning to cut off at the bottom, but it's still a very good picture.
003:16:30|C|Kerwin|That's a good picture, Fred.
003:16:36|T|LMP|And we're just about there. About 10 - 10 more feet now.
003:16:41|C|Kerwin|Rog.
003:16:43|T|LMP|Everything looks pretty good down in the S-IVB, too. The shroud still looks intact down there.
003:16:50|C|Kerwin|Good deal. There's really quite a bit of detail in this picture.
003:17:03|O|CDR|Contact.
003:17:07|T|CMP|Okay. We've - we've got two barber poles.
003:17:11|C|Kerwin|Houston; Roger.
003:18:10|T|LMP|Okay. You should be able to see down into the portion of the IU right now, Joe.
003:18:21|C|Kerwin|Fred, Houston. We'd like to try going to Average on the TV for a minute or so.
003:18:29|T|LMP|Okay. You've got Average, and a little yellow dust cap just floated by in front of us.
003:18:36|C|Kerwin|Yeah. We see it at the top of the screen.
003:18:41|C|Kerwin|And, Fred, after a few minutes of this, at your convenience, we could use some interior shots if you get the time and if the lighting is good.
003:18:51|T|LMP|Okay.
003:18:52|C|Kerwin|And, 13, Houston. The S-IVB vent times are nominal as in the Flight Plan within a few seconds.
003:19:18|T|CDR|We're hard docked, Houston.
003:19:21|C|Kerwin|Roger. Understand. Hard docked. Good deal. Fred, one more thing on the TV. If you could come down to f:22 again.
003:19:32|T|LMP|Okay. You've got f:22 again.
003:20:22|T|CDR|And, Houston, Fred will handle the camera as we go through the postdocking checklist.
003:20:26|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. Real good.
003:20:52|P|PAO|Haise is apparently maneuvering the camera inside the spacecraft for an interior view at this point and we'll stand by to see if we've got enough light inside the spacecraft to get a useable picture.
003:21:38|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. I am pointing it over toward Jack, and it's pretty bright with the Earth out that window. Is that sort of washing out the picture here?
003:21:49|C|Kerwin|No, Fred, it's not. We've got a bright spot where the window is. The rest of you are semi-silhouetted. It's a pretty impressive picture.
003:22:36|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
003:22:38|T|CMP|Go ahead, Joe.
003:22:40|C|Kerwin|For Fred. The IOS [?] has caught you with the fuel cell reactant values in latch again.
003:22:52|T|CDR|Touch&eacute;.
003:22:54|C|Kerwin|And we have word that the propellant usage for T&D was nominal.
003:23:01|T|CMP|Okay, what is nominal, please?
003:23:02|C|Kerwin|Well, I didn't ask that yet, Jack; stand by one.
003:23:07|T|CMP|That's okay (laughter).
003:24:20|C|Kerwin|Fred, this is Houston. Over.
003:24:22|T|LMP|Go ahead.
003:24:24|C|Kerwin|Okay. With the direct sunlight from the window, out of the TV camera field as it is now, we'd like you to open it up an f-stop or so and, if convenient, try to keep that bright spot out of the window.
003:24:40|T|LMP|Okay.
003:26:14|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. I guess we think we could stand one more click down on the f-stop.
003:26:24|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. He's going to do it.
003:26:26|C|Kerwin|That is, we want you to open it up. Looks like a very interesting book you're reading.
003:26:33|T|CMP|I've got two of them.
003:30:11|C|Kerwin|Hey, that's pretty, Fred.
003:30:17|T|LMP|Okay. I hope you got more detail than I have on the monitor here.
003:30:21|C|Kerwin|No. We probably don't, but it's kind of a neat picture anyway.
003:30:39|T|CMP|Houston, we're now going to finish repressurizing the tunnel.
003:30:46|C|Kerwin|Houston; Roger.
003:31:02|P|PAO|This view is looking up into the docking tunnel of the Command Module with the tunnel light showing toward the top of the tunnel.
003:31:47|T|LMP|... probably hear, Joe, we're just finishing pumping up Aquarius here.
003:31:54|C|Kerwin|Okay. About all we see on this picture, Fred, are the bright spots with the lights around the tunnel area. The hatch itself is pretty dark.
003:32:57|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. By the way, we'd like to know how the High Gain Antenna lockup worked. Our signal strength is a little bit lower than we thought it would be.
003:33:06|T|CMP|It looked just the way I expected it to, Joe. I had her sitting there in Reacq with the numbers cranked in and soon as we got pretty much through the rotation, I just threw it down to High Gain and it appeared to lock right up.
003:33:24|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good deal. See that flashlight beam wandering around there.
003:34:30|P|PAO|At this point, we're getting a good view of Jack Swigert in the left hand seat of the Command Module.
003:35:45|T|LMP|Houston, 13.
003:35:47|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
003:35:50|T|LMP|We'd kind of like to hold off on the - start the venting again until we get the things pumped back up inside here. Wonder if you might give us a call to remind us when to initiate that.
003:36:06|C|Kerwin|Okay, 13; will do.
003:36:26|T|LMP|And we'll try to shift her up to look up into the tunnel here.
003:36:31|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real good.
003:36:54|C|Kerwin|Okay, 13; Houston. I think we could use an f-stop lower. What f-stop are you in now?
003:37:03|T|LMP|I'm about as low as you can go, Joe. I'm sitting on 4.4.
003:37:06|C|Kerwin|Okay.
003:37:18|T|CMP|What you're looking at, Joe, is the commander has removed the hatch and is proceeding to stow it.
003:38:06|C|Kerwin|Okay, 13. That's a pretty good picture there.
003:38:14|T|CMP|The CDR is verifying the docking latches now.
003:38:17|C|Kerwin|Rog.
003:38:25|T|CMP|Hey, Joe. Jim reports that there's a slight, you know, burn smell up in the tunnel area, as been reported on previous flights.
003:38:34|C|Kerwin|Okay. We copy that.
003:39:06|T|CMP|Okay. The commander reports all docking latches latched.
003:39:11|C|Kerwin|Houston; Roger.
003:41:28|P|PAO|Although we have a rather dim picture at this time, we can see Jim Lovell working in the tunnel area. Lovell has removed the hatch cover, inspected the docking latches and reported that everything was in order in the tunnel. He should be shortly attaching the umbilical to the Lunar Module which will provide power to the heaters and some of the critical LM guidance equipment, and then reinstalling the tunnel hatch.
003:42:08|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. For your information, the S-IVB vent is proceeding on schedule.
003:42:15|T|CMP|Okay, Joe.
003:42:20|T|LMP|Yeah, Joe. That's - That's concurring with all the thousands of particles I see going by outside here.
003:42:30|C|Kerwin|Yes. I guess I didn't need to tell you.
003:44:16|C|Kerwin|13. Looks like Jim is connecting the umbilical at this time. Is that right?
003:44:21|T|LMP|Yeah, that's affirm - affirm, Joe. Do you have any detail up in there at all? On the monitor it looks like I can - I can make out the drogue - the drogue a little bit, but not much else.
003:44:34|C|Kerwin|We can see the probe pretty well, and we can see his hands quite well there.
003:45:59|T|LMP|Okay. We're powering the LM now, Joe.
003:46:03|C|Kerwin|Okay, Roger that.
003:46:19|C|Kerwin|And the voltage looks good there, 13.
003:46:23|T|LMP|Roger.
003:47:04|T|LMP|Okay. We're going to take an outside view now, out the left side, Joe.
003:47:07|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. Real good.
003:47:24|P|PAO|This television transmission has being going on now for about forty minutes, and during that period of time, the spacecraft has covered more than five thousand miles. We currently show an altitude of 10,481 nautical miles [19,411 km].
003:48:03|T|LMP|Okay. You making out the picture up there, Joe?
003:48:07|C|Kerwin|Yeah. Is that the world?
003:48:19|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. That's a pretty nice looking picture. We'd like to know what settings you used to get that.
003:48:28|T|LMP|Okay. I think Jim's holding it now and - it - Okay, it should be in about f:22, infinity, and I think the 50-millimeter. And Jim says he thinks he has Baja in the picture now.
003:48:50|C|Kerwin|Okay. I think we could stand to go to f:44 on that. The clouds are pretty bright.
003:48:56|T|LMP|Okay. We're going to have to press on here, Joe, so we're back inside.
003:49:00|C|Kerwin|Okay. Thanks a lot.
003:54:04|T|LMP|Okay. How's that picture looking back outside now, Joe? Getting ready for LM extraction.
003:54:13|C|Kerwin|Okay. That looks pretty good, Fred.
003:55:14|T|CDR|Houston, this is 13. Do we have a Go for pyro arm?
003:55:20|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Affirmative. You're Go for pyro arm.
003:55:50|T|CMP|Hey, Joe, when we went back up and rechecked the tunnel there, we found two latches that weren't cocked and we reset them.
003:56:02|C|Kerwin|Ah, Roger that, Jack.
003:56:56|T|CMP|Joe, I've got a beautiful view of the Earth out window 1.
003:57:03|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jack.
003:57:04|T|LMP|By the way, the windows came through in real good shape. Window 5 looks real clean, so I'm kind of hopeful that Hycon stuff will be pretty good.
003:57:14|C|Kerwin|Good deal.
003:57:22|T|LMP|I meant window 3, Joe.
003:57:58|C|Kerwin|Okay, 13; Houston. You're Go for LM SEP whenever you're ready.
003:58:06|T|CDR|Roger.
003:58:18|C|Kerwin|Okay, 13; Houston. Correction on that. You're Go for LM SEP at the nominal time and - or later. We don't want it early.
003:58:27|T|CDR|Okay, Joe. We'll do it at 04:01:00.
003:58:29|C|Kerwin|Roger.
003:58:50|P|PAO|We're now about two minutes away from the scheduled CSM LM ejection time. At that time, the crew will activate a switch which separates the - which fires pryotechnics separating tie-down straps and the spring actuators at the attach points of the LM landing gear. It will eject the LM and the Command and Service Module at a velocity of about eight-tenths of a foot a second [25 cm/s]. This will be coupled then with a short burn with the Reaction Control System jets adding another four tenths of a foot per second [12 cm/s] to the separation velocity, giving them a total separation velocity of 1.2 feet per second [37 cm/s].
004:00:54|T|CMP|Okay. We're about ready to pull the LM out, Joe.
004:00:59|C|Kerwin|Okay, 13.
004:01:03|T|CMP|Here she comes.
004:01:15|T|CMP|Okay. It looks like we're clear, Joe.
004:01:19|C|Kerwin|Okay. Looks good. It's weird because we get the TV about 10 seconds after you call it.
004:02:06|P|PAO|We've been advised that within a few minutes we'll have to recycle the converter which converts the television picture we're receiving from sequential black and white to color. This would require the converter to be down for a couple of minutes, while it's reloaded with tape and in that interim period of time we would expect the picture to be down.
004:02:45|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
004:02:52|T|CDR|Go ahead.
004:02:53|C|Kerwin|Okay. We'll be waiting for you to tell us that you feel you're safely clear of the booster, and give us the Go to command the booster in its yaw maneuver.
004:04:39|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Did you - did you copy my last about giving us a Go for the yaw?
004:04:46|T|LMP|Yeah, we're maneuvering, Joe, and we hadn't picked her back up again yet.
004:04:55|C|Kerwin|Okay. Do you want to wait till you acquire it before we yaw it?
004:05:03|T|CDR|How much time do you have, Houston? Can you wait, or do you want to do it right now?
004:05:09|C|Kerwin|We can wait if you want us to, Jim.
004:05:11|T|CDR|Why don't you wait just a little bit.
004:05:13|C|Kerwin|Okay.
004:06:02|T|CMP|Joe, did they ever get an idea of what that - the TD and E fuel was?
004:06:09|C|Kerwin|Jack, they're not willing to pin it down to a specific number right now because they say the tanks will warm up later on and the apparent consumption will go down. But it was nominal.
004:06:20|T|CMP|Okay.
004:08:26|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. We have the S-IVB in sight. You're Go to maneuver the S-IVB.
004:08:31|C|Kerwin|Houston, Roger that.
004:09:04|T|CMP|We'll try to give you a - Houston, we're going to try to give you a shot of the S-IVB with the TV out window number 3.
004:09:11|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real good, Jack. Our S-band signal strength has been fluctuating. Does it seem to be going all right up there in the Auto Track mode ?
004:09:24|T|LMP|Yeah. Right now; yes, it's dropped off to about the 70-percent point, Joe, and it was before up about 85.
004:09:34|C|Kerwin|Okay.
004:09:54|T|CDR|And, Houston, do you have a TV picture?
004:09:57|C|Kerwin|Not at the moment, Jim. We had a garbled one there for a few seconds, and we don't have one at this moment.
004:10:05|T|CDR|Okay. I can see the S-IVB now out the hatch window and it's -
004:10:09|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. Suddenly we have a very good picture.
004:10:13|T|CDR|Okay.
004:10:50|T|CDR|And, Houston, I can see the gold shroud around the IU, and it looks that it's all intact.
004:10:56|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jim. We copy that. Incidentally, the APS evasive maneuver will be about 4 minutes late. It'll be at about 04 plus 18.
004:11:09|T|CDR|Roger.
004:11:37|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Wonder if you could zoom in on that S-IVB for us a little bit?
004:11:42|T|CDR|Okay.
004:12:19|C|Kerwin|Yeah, yeah. More like that.  That's nice.  It's off our screen to the right, now.
004:13:08|C|Kerwin|Oh, that's very nice, very nice.
004:13:55|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. Is EECOM monitoring the O<sub>2</sub> Flow High light again? We - we haven't yet started the venting yet.
004:14:04|C|Kerwin|Okay. Stand by. I'll check.
004:14:35|C|Kerwin|13, Houston.
004:14:38|T|CMP|Go ahead.
004:14:39|C|Kerwin|Jack, your cabin Regs are still making up, but you're Go to open the waste management vent again at this time, and we'll delta the time to close it by the appropriate amount for you.
004:14:52|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine. Well, we'll wait till the S-IVB does its maneuver here.
004:14:58|C|Kerwin|Okay.
004:15:40|P|PAO|We've just had a dropout in signal as the spacecraft maneuvered out of the field of view of the High Gain Antenna. At this point, the crew should be switching shortly to the Omni antennas and we'd expect to reacquire signal lockon.
004:16:53|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. We just had a momentary drop off in signal strength again there.
004:16:59|C|Kerwin|Roger, Fred. We had an LOS for a minute and we lost our TV picture. It looks like - yeah, we just got it back. It looks great again.
004:17:15|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. You might stop the f-stop down one more notch, if you got any left.
004:17:41|C|Kerwin|And, 13, Houston. We'll be commanding the evasive maneuver in about 17 seconds.
004:18:41|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. We can see it start to move. However, it doesn't seem to be a lot of debris or vapor coming out of it.
004:18:48|C|Kerwin|Roger that, Jack. Booster says that's great. He says the booster's doing its thing normally. Concur. We don't see much on the television at all.
004:19:16|C|Kerwin|And, Apollo 13, Houston. We'd like to change the S-band antenna configuration. Like you to go Omni Delta. Like you to go Manual mode on the High Gain with pitch of minus 60 and yaw of 90. Over.
004:19:37|T|LMP|Okay. You want us to Omni Delta and Manual on the High Gain to minus 60 and plus 90. Is that correct?
004:19:44|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative.
004:20:06|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. How much longer would you like the television?
004:20:10|C|Kerwin|Stand by on that. We'll get a word.
004:20:21|C|Kerwin|Okay, 13; this is Houston. You can turn the TV off anytime you're ready. We've enjoyed the show.
004:20:40|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Before you secure the TV, we'd like to know whether that was in maximum zoom, just for information.
004:20:48|T|LMP|That's affirm. Jim had it in Max zoom.
004:20:51|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good deal. That was a real good picture.
004:21:24|C|Kerwin|And, 13, Houston. The APS evasive maneuver appeared to be nominal. The LOX dump time is now 4 plus 39 plus 20, about 3 minutes late.
004:21:37|T|CDR|Roger.
004:22:16|P|PAO|The booster engineer reports the preliminary indications are that our Saturn S-IVB evasive maneuver was successful. The Flight Dynamics Officer will be evaluating the trajectory to assure that we've got the kind of separation from the spacecraft that we were looking for and also to determine to what extent we are heading toward the trajectory which would impact the S-IVB on the Moon. At 6 pm Central Standard Time, there will be a press conference in the news center auditorium. This is the small auditorium in Building 1, with Ken Mattingly. Astronaut Mattingly, until a few days ago, was the prime Command Module Pilot for the mission and due to exposure to measles, was replaced by Jack Swigert. Mattingly has been in the control center and is currently in the control center observing the progress of the mission. I have to repeat that press conference with astronaut Mattingly is scheduled for 6 pm Central Standard Time in the news center auditorium.
004:24:24|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. We're right now opening the Waste Stowage Vent.
004:24:29|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. We copy.
004:25:00|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. We're charging battery B.
004:25:05|C|Kerwin|Roger, 13. We see it. Looks good.
004:30:47|C|Kerwin|Apollo l3, Houston. Request Omni Alpha now. Over.
004:36:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 4 hours, 37 minutes. We're now about 3 minutes away from the scheduled LOX dump, the propulsive vent of liquid oxygen through the engine nozzle of the S-IVB. The Saturn Instrument Unit will command this maneuver or command the LOX dump and the LOX will flow out the engine bell for 48 seconds or until the tank is empty whichever comes first. The preliminary plan would be for the LOX dump to produce a change in velocity of about 28 feet per second [8.5 m/s] which would contribute to the trajectory change placing the S-IVB on an impacting trajectory with the Moon and subsequent midcourse corrections using the two 70-pound thrust [311-newton] Auxiliary Propulsion System units on the S-IVB would be intended to correct this trajectory and bring it into the precisely preplanned limits.
004:39:01|C|Young|Apollo 13, Houston.
004:39:04|T|CMP|Go ahead, Joe.
004:39:07|C|Young|Roger. They are having trouble verifying that the High Gain is doing its thing. Like to verify that the pitch is minus 10, the Y is plus 350, you're in Wide Beam Width and Auto.
004:39:29|T|CMP|Okay. Minus 10 pitch, plus 350 yaw, and Wide Beam Width and going into Auto. You want High Gain, John?
004:39:41|C|Young|That's affirm.
004:39:44|T|CMP|Okay. Here, it's coming at you.
004:40:16|P|PAO|Astronaut John Young, who was backup commander for Apollo 13, is now serving as Capsule Communicator in place of astronaut Joe Kerwin.
004:44:21|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The Ken Mattingly press conference is scheduled to begin shortly in the MSC news center auditorium. During the press conference, we will tape any conversation with the spacecraft and play that back immediately following the press conference. At 4 hours, 45 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
004:50:43|T|LMP|Ah, Houston; 13.
004:50:45|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
004:50:49|T|LMP|Is the S-IVB doing something different now?
004:50:56|C|Kerwin|Well, I don't know. It should be - let's see, it should have started the LOX dump at least quite a while ago. I guess that's complete. Why do you ask, Fred?
004:51:10|T|LMP|I'm looking out window 5 at what I think is the S-IVB, and I'm seeing what looks to be double plumes, growing in - it's two very narrow bands, maybe about 3 degrees, that are streaming out from it. And then there is a less dense band that covers maybe a 40-degree swath through the sky that continues out, also, in two directions.
004:51:45|T|CMP|Hey, Joe, what it looks like, kind of, is if you pull up behind a guy that's pulling a contrail, and you get in his contrail, like he's going away from you - there's a long contrail.
004:51:55|C|Kerwin|Okay; stand by. Let me see what Frank's got to say about that.
004:51:59|T|LMP|Except we're between - Looks like we're between two contrails, one guy above and one below.
004:52:07|C|Kerwin|Roger.
004:52:14|T|LMP|It's a very pretty sight.
004:52:33|C|Kerwin|Okay, 13; Houston. The booster says that the propulsive dump is concluded; he now has the nonpropulsive vents open and what you see is a normal phenomenon and it should go on for another 5 minutes or so.
004:52:52|T|LMP|Okay.
004:52:54|C|Kerwin|And, while I've got you, 13, at your convenience, we'd like to have the results of the EMS bias tests that you did pre-TLI and pre-Sep.
004:53:08|T|CMP|Stand by.
004:53:10|C|Kerwin|Okay.
004:54:05|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. The TLI - the Delta-V no-bias test prior to TLI, we had a 0.8, and post-TLI, it was 1.0.
004:54:24|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. Copy that. Thank you very much. Incidentally, as your tracking gets better and better, the size of MCC-2 is getting lower and lower and figures to be somewhere between 10 and 30 feet per second now.
004:54:40|T|CMP|Sounds good.
004:54:41|C|Kerwin|Yeah, sure does.
004:54:54|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
004:54:56|T|CMP|Go ahead, Joe.
004:54:57|C|Kerwin|Okay. We have a PTC REFSMMAT ready, if you're ready to go P00 and Accept, we'll stick it in there.
004:55:05|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by.
004:55:08|C|Kerwin|Okay.
004:55:45|T|CMP|Okay. I'm P00 and Accept, Joe.
004:55:48|C|Kerwin|Okay. Roger that.
004:57:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 4 hours, 58 minutes. During the press conference, the liquid oxygen propulsive vent from the S-IVB was completed successfully. We also had an exchange with the crew during which Jack Swigert and Fred Haise reported noticing what appeared to be contrails coming from the S-IVB and we advised them that this was a normal occurrence during the propulsive vent from the S-IVB. The plan was to dump the liquid oxygen for a total of 48 seconds or until the tank went dry. As it turned out, the tank did not go dry at the end of 48 seconds and the Instrument Unit, as planned, shut the vent off. Now this meant, then, that we continued to get non-propulsive venting which produced the apparent contrails viewed by the crew. We have a scheduled midcourse correction opportunity for the S-IVB at six hours. It is expected that this midcourse correction will be required and we also have an opportunity at 9 hours for an additional midcourse correction on the S-IVB to assure that it is on a trajectory which will impact the Moon at the desired point. We'll play back for you now, the taped conversations with the crew, and then continue to stand-by for any live communications with the spacecraft.
004:59:02|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. We'll have a handover in half a minute or so. You may get a momentary loss of strength.
004:59:09|T|CMP|Okay, Joe.
005:00:28|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. The computer is yours. Over.
005:00:31|T|CMP|Okay. Going to Block.
005:00:32|C|Kerwin|Roger.
005:15:50|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 5 hours, 16 minutes. This is a relatively quite period in the Flight Plan, and we'd like to take this opportunity to replay a tape recording of remarks made today by Vice President, Spiro Agnew and West German Chancellor, Willy Brandt at the Kennedy Launch Control Center following today's liftoff. A communications failure at the cape prevented a release of a large part of these remarks during the time they were delivered. We understand the total tape is about 10 minutes in duration. We'll play that for you now.
005:30:13|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Do you copy 13's torquing angles on the P52?
005:30:18|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Leave them up just a second, and we'll get them down.
005:30:29|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Okay. We got 'em.
005:30:46|T|CMP|Okay. The time of torquing was 5 hours, 30 minutes and 40 seconds.
005:30:51|C|Kerwin|Roger. We copy.
005:39:47|T|CDR|Hello, Houston; Apollo 13.
005:39:49|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
005:39:51|T|CDR|Okay. I just got all hooked up to get in my comm system here, and I just wanted to check out. I've got my suit stowed, a few other odds and ends done, and I'm back in business again.
005:40:01|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good deal. We're kind of hanging loose down here. I've got a Lift-off plus 15 PAD. There's no hurry to read it up, so let us know when you're ready.
005:40:09|T|CDR|Okay.
005:41:24|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 5 hours, 41 minutes. At the present time, we show Apollo 13 to be 24,916 nautical miles [46,144 km] from Earth. The spacecraft velocity is 12,172 feet per second [3,710 metres/second]. The Booster engineer here in Mission Control is currently -
005:41:44|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Go ahead with the PAD.
005:41:47|P|PAO|And we'll stand by for that PAD to the crew.
005:41:48|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. Lift-off plus 15 PAD: GET<sub>I</sub>, 015:00; Delta-V<sub>T</sub>, 5622; longitude, minus 165; and GET 400K, 047:04. Over.
005:42:19|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Lift-off plus 15: GET<sub>I</sub>, 015:00; 5622; minus 165; 047:04. Is that correct?
005:42:36|C|Kerwin|That's right, Jim.
005:45:13|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 5 hours, 45 minutes. Our Booster systems engineers just reported that the first midcourse correction opportunity with the S-IVB, the midcourse correction designed to put the S-IVB on the proper impacting trajectory with the Moon, will be required and it is expected that this maneuver will be a 217-second burn of the two Auxiliary Propulsion System modules on the S-IVB. These modules each produce 70 pounds of thrust [311 newtons] for a total thrust of 140 pounds [623 N]. The Booster engineer also reported that it would probably be required to utilize the second S-IVB midcourse correction opportunity at 9 hours to assure the proper trajectory. Midcourse correction 1 for the spacecraft, the Command and Service Modules, is not expected to be needed. The first midcourse correction opportunity which we would anticipate the possibility of having to make a small midcourse correction would be for midcourse correction number 2 at the scheduled time in the Flight Plan. At 5 hours, 47 minutes; this is Mission Control, Houston.
005:54:45|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
005:54:47|T|CMP|Go ahead, Joe.
005:54:48|T|CDR|Go ahead, Joe.
005:54:50|C|Kerwin|Rog. We'd like to have the Attitude Set switch back to GDC, if you're finished with your align. It gives G&amp;C down here a telemetry problem.
005:55:01|T|CMP|Yeah; okay.
005:55:02|C|Kerwin|Thank you.
005:55:10|T|CMP|I'm just going to give them one more align here.
005:55:12|C|Kerwin|Okay. No rush.
005:59:09|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 5 hours, 59 minutes. We're about one minute away now from the scheduled midcourse correction with the Saturn S-IVB, the third stage of the Saturn. This mid-course correction will utilize the auxiliary propulsion units on the Saturn third stage, each producing 70 pounds of thrust [311 newtons] for a total thrust of 140 pounds [623 N]. The maneuver will be commanded by the Saturn Instrument Unit. It is scheduled to have a total Delta velocity, a change in velocity of about 29.7 feet per second [9.1 m/s]; the burn duration planned for 217 seconds. This maneuver is targeted to impact the S-IVB on the lunar surface at longitude and latitude of about 3 degrees south, 30 degrees west. And our booster engineer reports that the midcourse burn has been initiated at this time.
006:03:55|P|PAO|This is Mission Control at 6 hours, 3 minutes. The Booster engineer has just reported that the midcourse correction with the S-IVB is complete. We'll be standing by for an analysis of the results of that midcourse correction. The midcourse correction opportunities scheduled at 6 hours and 9 hours for the S-IVB are intended to impact the Saturn third stage within about 200 kilometers of the Apollo 12 landing site. That would be 200 kilometers west of the Apollo 12 landing site. At the present time in Mission Control, we're in the process of changing shifts. Flight Director Gerry Griffin is coming on to replace Flight Director Milton Windler. We expect that the change of shift briefing will occur at about 8 pm Central Standard Time in the News Center Auditorium. At 6 hours, 5 minutes; this is Mission Control, Houston.
006:15:40|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
006:15:41|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
006:15:43|C|Kerwin|Rog. Would you please verify or tell us what S-band antenna configuration you're in, please?
006:15:51|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by.
006:16:07|T|CDR|We're in High Gain.
006:16:10|C|Kerwin|Roger. Stand by a minute, Jim. Our signal strength is getting a little low. We may have a recommendation.
006:16:21|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Are you in Manual or Auto in High Gain?
006:16:26|T|CDR|Stand by.  We're in Auto Track, Joe, and High Gain.
006:16:34|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 17 minutes into the mission. The change of shift news briefing time has been advanced. We're anticipating the change of shift news briefing to begin in approximately ten minutes. Approximately ten minutes, in the news center briefing room.
006:16:37|C|Kerwin|Roger.
006:38:50|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 38 minutes. The Flight Director Gerry Griffin has been taking status reports from each of his flight controllers. Everyone reports all spacecraft systems looking good. The Flight Surgeon reports the biomedical instrumentation looks excellent - very clean data. He thinks that, when this crew completes this long day, that they'll be tired and get a good night's sleep. They have about another six and a half hours before bedtime today. Booster systems engineer reports the S-IVB has been safed, retaining attitude control and midcourse capability, but that all pressure spheres have been dumped. He also reports to the Flight Director that the second midcourse correction for the S-IVB may be later than Ground Elapsed Time of 9 hours. He wants to get a good tracking vector to use for this final maneuver and he's not quite sure whether he'll do the maneuver at 9 hours or a little bit later after he refines his tracking data. He reports the S-IVB still has 372 seconds of burn time remaining, plus enough fuel in the APS after that to maintain attitude until 12 hours Elapsed Time. The guidance officer is watching Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert perform cislunar navigation tasks. Through telemetry, he's monitoring Swigert's marking stars with the sextant. He's very complimentary of Swigert's ability in this task. On his P23, says this procedure going very smoothly. At 6 hours, 41 minutes; this is Mission Control, Houston.
006:44:30|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. You copy 13?
006:44:39|T|CDR|Hello, Houston; Apollo 13. Over.
006:44:48|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
006:44:51|T|CMP|Hey, were you copying my P23 results?
006:44:56|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative, Jack. We followed you through the whole thing. You're ahead of schedule, hey.
006:45:03|T|CMP|Okay.
006:45:04|T|CDR|And, Joe, we confirmed there's no midcourse-1. Over.
006:45:11|C|Kerwin|That is affirmative as far as I know. Let's get a final check on it, Jim.
006:45:16|T|CDR|Okay. Because we're standing by. We want to do a fuel cell purge and a waste water dump.
006:45:24|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We confirm that there will be no midcourse-1.
006:45:30|T|CDR|Okay. Sounds good.
006:45:42|C|Kerwin|And, 13, Houston. You can go ahead with the purge and dump at your discretion.
006:45:47|T|CDR|Roger, Houston. What we're going to do is, we're going to get rid of Fred's suit here. Fred's suit has been right in the commander's slot here for the last half hour. So we're going to try and get it stowed.
006:46:00|C|Kerwin|Okay.
006:46:03|T|CDR|You did a pretty good job.
006:46:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 46 minutes. We'll take the release line down now while the change of shift news briefing is under way. We will tape any air-ground and play it back after the news briefing. This is Mission Control, Houston.
006:49:12|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. We'll have a handover in about 1 minute.
006:49:17|T|CDR|Hello, Houston. Apollo 13.
006:49:20|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jim. We'll have a handover from Hawaii to Goldstone in about 30 seconds.
006:49:26|T|CDR|Say again, Houston.
006:49:29|C|Kerwin|We'll be handing over from Hawaii to Goldstone in a few seconds. You may get a temporary loss of comm.
006:49:37|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We've got a whole bunch of noise, too.
006:59:16|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 59 minutes. During the news conference the air to ground conversation totaled 35 seconds. We have the tape of that now. We'll play that for you and then we will stay up live.
006:59:23|T|CMP|Okay. Houston, 13.
006:59:26|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
006:59:28|T|CMP|Hey, Joe. Do you want to dump waste water down to 25 percent. Is that right?
006:59:33|C|Kerwin|That's affirm.
006:59:34|T|CMP|Okay, in work.
006:59:35|C|Kerwin|Okay.
007:00:18|T|CMP|Do you know we're also purging fuel cells O<sub>2</sub> now.
007:00:21|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack.
007:00:21|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 7 hours, 9 minutes. Astronaut Vance Brand has just relieved astronaut Joe Kerwin at the CapCom console.
007:09:31|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. The fuel cell purge and waste water dump are complete.
007:09:38|C|Brand|Roger, Apollo 13. And this is your relief CapCom shift on now.
007:09:49|T|CDR|Well, good evening, Vance.
007:09:53|T|CMP|Boy, you sure made it back fast.
007:09:55|C|Brand|Yes. You guys had a beautiful launch, there. Really nice.
007:10:07|T|CMP|Could you follow it all the way up, Vance?
007:10:11|C|Brand|No, I didn't see staging. It was too hazy for that, but we could see it for a few miles anyway.
007:10:24|T|CMP|I'll tell you, it's sure an interesting ride.
007:10:28|C|Brand|Right.
007:17:00|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 13.
007:17:02|C|Brand|Rog. Go ahead, Jim.
007:17:05|T|CDR|Roger. We're at that stage now where we're going to take some Earth weather photography. If you're standing by, I have the camera aimed at the Earth right now, and I'll give you a mark when I take the first picture.
007:17:19|C|Brand|Roger. We copy, Jim. We'll be standing by for the mark.
007:17:41|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. 3, 2, 1 -
007:17:45|T|CDR|Mark.
007:17:48|C|Brand|Roger, copy.
007:18:17|C|Brand|And Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
007:18:21|T|CDR|Go ahead.
007:18:23|C|Brand|For the PTC, recommend that you disable quads A and B. Over.
007:18:30|T|CDR|Okay. Disable quads A and B, will do; and soon as Jack gets finished thrashing around, we'll be going to that PTC mode.
007:18:37|C|Brand|Okay.
007:31:29|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're starting PTC. We're disabling quads A and B now.
007:31:34|C|Brand|Roger, Apollo 13. Houston copies.
007:33:08|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
007:33:11|T|CDR|Go ahead.
007:33:12|C|Brand|Jim, we'd like to verify that the High Gain is secured, that the S-band antenna is on Omni, and Omni B should be the right antenna. Over.
007:33:27|T|CDR|Okay. You want the High Gain secured and you want the Omni on Omni Charlie, huh? Or Baker?
007:33:35|C|Brand|That's affirm. And this'll be maintained in the PTC.
007:33:39|T|CDR|Okay.
007:33:50|C|Brand|And the High Gain angles for stowage - or for stowing - are pitch minus 52, yaw 270.
007:39:21|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 13.
007:39:24|C|Brand|Roger. Go ahead.
007:39:26|T|CDR|Stand by for another Earth weather picture. I'll give you a mark.
007:39:29|C|Brand|Okay. Standing by, Jim.
007:39:46|T|CDR|3, 2, 1  -
007:39:49|T|CDR|Mark.
007:39:51|C|Brand|Houston copies.
007:40:22|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
007:40:24|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
007:40:27|C|Brand|Houston here. Your rates look very stable. It looks like your rates are damped out completely here. As far as we can see, it would be alright to start the PTC.
007:40:39|T|CDR|Okay. We'll give it a try.
007:46:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. It's 7 hours, 46 minutes. Apollo 13 now 37,630 nautical miles [69,691 km] from Earth. Velocity, 9,878 feet per second [3,011 metres/second]. Apollo 13 taking Earth weather photography, photographing the Earth one frame every twenty minutes for three hours. Jim Lovell has taken two photographs so far. We have a reminder for the newsmen from the print media. There will be a meeting at 9:30 am tomorrow, Sunday, in the news center briefing room. The writing press will select representatives to fill the Mission Control Center pool positions at that time. 9:30 am Central Standard Time tomorrow. At 7 hours, 47 minutes; this is Mission Control, Houston.
007:54:29|T|LMP|Hello, Houston. This is 13. How do you read?
007:54:34|C|Brand|13; Houston. Loud and clear.  13, Houston's reading loud and clear. How do you read?
007:54:48|T|LMP|Okay. And do you have any estimate, Vance, on how long we'll be charging battery B?
007:55:01|C|Brand|Stand by 1, Fred.
007:55:21|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
007:55:24|T|CDR|Go ahead.
007:55:26|C|Brand|We'll be charging for 4&frac12; to 5 hours yet, Jim.
007:55:32|T|CDR|Roger.
008:02:33|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
008:02:36|T|LMP|Go ahead.
008:02:39|C|Brand|Aah, Fred, recommend that, when your window comes around facing the Earth again, that you catch another one of those pictures, and at the same time, you should probably start PTC again. We might have sent a confusing bit of info up to you. The 'disable two quads' only applies to an early step in the procedure. We didn't mean that for the latter part of the procedure where we have the statement 'enable all jets.' Over.
008:03:15|T|LMP|Okay.
008:07:33|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 13.
008:07:43|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston. Go ahead.
008:07:46|T|CMP|Vance, Fred said that you had some more information about PTC and a different way of establishing it or something, huh?
008:07:55|C|Brand|Rog. Referring to the procedure on G/8-2, if you have that open, I'll tell you what we had to give you.
008:08:11|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by and I'll get it out.
008:08:13|C|Brand|Okay.
008:08:35|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead, Vance.
008:08:38|C|Brand|Okay. On checklist G/8-2 under step 5, there's a statement, 'disable all jets on two adjacent quads,' and that's what we were referring to when we called up saying 'disable quads A and B.' So that's all fine; however, going down now to step 7 where it says 'enable all jets,' we hope that you didn't think we meant leave A and B disabled there. In that case, it's as written. All jets should be enabled. Over.
008:09:20|T|CMP|Okay. Our checklist has 'all jets' scratched out, and it says 'enable couples on all axes.' So what we'll do is - we'll re-establish this thing and come down to that step 7, and we'll enable all jets. That means enable quads A and B. Is that right?
008:09:42|C|Brand|That's affirm. You'll have A, B, C, and D enabled for step 7.
008:09:47|T|CMP|Okay, real fine. I'll start on it now.
008:09:51|C|Brand|Okay. Understand you're going to re-establish it.
008:10:46|T|LMP|And Vance, on that picture, I was all set to shoot it just a little before you called, and the Earth hasn't showed up in the window yet. I don't know if we got too far off the bellyband or what.
008:11:02|C|Brand|Roger. Copy, Fred.
008:11:46|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
008:11:50|T|CMP|Go ahead, Vance.
008:11:52|C|Brand|Roger. On the photo, you'll probably have to re-establish the attitude for PTC and then whenever it comes into the window again, why we'll just be standing by for the photo.
008:12:06|T|LMP|Okay.
008:19:49|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
008:19:53|T|CMP|Go ahead, Vance.
008:19:57|C|Brand|Roger, You're coming in a little weak. Have a recommended roll rate for this PTC, if you could copy.
008:20:08|T|CMP|Ah, go ahead.
008:20:10|C|Brand|Okay. Recommend that you put in R1 the following: 03750, and that should give you exactly a rate of 0.3 degrees per second. Over.
008:20:27|T|CMP|Okay, 03750. Is plus or minus our choice?
008:20:38|C|Brand|Roger. The same direction you rolled last time, which I believe is plus.
008:20:47|T|CMP|Okay.
008:25:06|T|CMP|Hey, Vance, would you monitor our rates and kind of give us an idea of when you think they're stable enough to start PTC.
008:25:14|C|Brand|Rog, Jack. We'll take a look and let you know as soon as they look stable enough.
008:25:19|T|CMP|Okay. I've got quads A and B disabled here.
008:25:24|C|Brand|Roger.
008:25:32|T|CMP|Have they come up with an idea of how much fuel I used on the docking and also the P23 session at 5 hours or 6 hours.
008:25:47|C|Brand|I think we can give you something. Stand by a minute.
008:26:59|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
008:27:02|T|CMP|Go ahead.
008:27:04|C|Brand|Okay. It's looking good so far as RCS consumables are concerned, Jack. You're standing about 20 pounds above the curve right now. Looking at the TD&amp;E, you expended 65 pounds or - Stand by - 55 pounds, correction on that.
008:27:27|T|CMP|How much?
008:27:28|C|Brand|And 14 pounds on P23s. You used a little more out of quad A than out of the others.
008:27:37|T|CMP|Okay. Thanks, Vance.
008:27:38|C|Brand|Rog.
008:27:42|T|CMP|Hey, could you say again the TD&amp;E fuel? We've got a different - we all heard different things.
008:27:49|C|Brand|I said 65 and then corrected that to 55 pounds.
008:27:55|T|CMP|Okay.
008:31:36|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
008:31:39|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
008:31:41|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. Your rates look good. It's okay to start the roll again, if you'd like.
008:31:50|T|CMP|In work.
008:40:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 8 hours, 40 minutes. Apollo 13's altitude now 42,464 nautical miles [78,643 km] from Earth. Velocity, 9,210 feet per second [2,807 m/s].
008:41:34|T|LMP|Hello, Houston, 13.
008:41:46|T|LMP|Hello, Houston; Apollo 13.
008:41:49|C|Brand|Apollo 13, go ahead.
008:41:53|T|LMP|Okay. Ready for a little count here, Vance, and I'll shoot another picture. We found the Earth again.
008:41:59|C|Brand|Okay. We'll be standing by, Fred.
008:42:05|T|LMP|Okay. 3, 2, 1 -
008:42:09|T|LMP|Mark.
008:42:11|C|Brand|Roger. Copy.
008:51:53|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 8 hours, 51 minutes. Tracking of the S-IVB since its first midcourse correction indicates that a second midcourse correction will not be necessary. I repeat; a second midcourse correction of the S-IVB trajectory will not be necessary, based on tracking to date since the first midcourse correction. The booster systems engineers plan to wait until about 10 hours Elapsed Time before making a final decision on whether to perform a midcourse. They want to get further tracking data from some other stations, and will have it by that time. The present indications are that the S-IVB is on the proper trajectory to impact the Moon at the planned impact point, and a - Booster has come up with a time based on present indications, a prediction that the impact will take place at 77 hours, 49 minutes, 23 seconds. He says he will update this time later, but that's the prediction at the present time. His studies all show that capability to command the midcourse will exist until an Elapsed Time of 13 hours, 48 minutes. Capability to command attitude control will exist to the same Elapsed Time time; 13 hours, 48 minutes. And, we at present have capability to track the S-IVB until an Elapsed Time of 84 hours, 42 minutes which is well past the predicted impact time. Apollo 13's altitude now 43,653 nautical miles [80,845 km] from Earth. Velocity, 9,069 feet per second [2,764 m/s].
009:02:47|T|LMP|Hey, Houston, 13.
009:02:50|C|Brand|Roger. Go ahead.
009:02:52|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by for a mark on another picture.
009:02:55|C|Brand|Okay. Standing by, Fred.
009:03:09|T|LMP|3, 2, 1 -
009:03:13|T|LMP|Mark.
009:03:17|C|Brand|Okay, we got it.
009:23:58|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
009:24:08|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
009:24:11|C|Brand|Jim, Houston here. Two items: first of all, your PTC is looking very good and it should carry you through the night; second point, have a procedure to give you, if you're ready to copy. We'd like to set three bits in the computer, and I'll explain why.
009:24:43|T|LMP|Go ahead, Vance, we're ready to copy.
009:24:46|C|Brand|Okay. The procedure is as follows: Verb 25, Noun 07, Enter; 1331, Enter; 7, Enter; and Enter. Explanation as follows. During the P23s, there was one time when Verb 37 was entered into the computer at about 16 seconds after the Optics Zero switch was flicked to Zero. This is a very uncommon anomaly in that, if you do this during - point - four tenth of a second interval at around 16 seconds after you zero the optics, some OPT-mode bits are reset; and this would mean that, if you had a OCDU fail, it wouldn't be indicated; so all this procedure is doing is setting these three bits back again where they should be.
009:26:01|T|CMP|Okay, Vance, and I guess I'll try to be slower on that Verb 37.
009:26:07|C|Brand|Yes. Actually slower or faster, either one, I guess. Well, yeah, slower. It's a very unusual thing to have that happen.
009:26:19|T|LMP|Okay. And, Houston, stand by for a mark on another picture.
009:26:24|C|Brand|Rog. Standing by.
009:26:33|T|LMP|3, 2, 1 -
009:26:36|T|LMP|Mark it.
009:26:39|C|Brand|Roger. We copy, Fred.
009:26:54|T|CMP|Okay, Vance; we've completed that procedure, and let me know if everything was okay.
009:26:59|C|Brand|Okay, thank you. We'll let you know if anything isn't okay. I'm sure it's good now.
009:27:15|T|CMP|Tell G&amp;C and Guido thanks a lot for keeping good track of me, there.
009:27:21|C|Brand|Rog. They're right on the ball.
009:27:36|C|Brand|And, 13, Houston. If you would like, we can let you know about every 2 minutes before the Earth should be coming into your window. We think we've got it pegged down pretty well now, and you won't have to look for it so much. Do you want that?
009:27:54|T|LMP|Yeah. That would be fine, Vance.
009:27:56|C|Brand|Okay.
009:28:06|C|Brand|And, 13, Houston. Guido says the bits are reset - rather, are set.
009:28:13|T|CMP|Okay, thanks much.
009:31:58|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 32 minutes. The Booster systems engineer has just advised Flight Director Gerry Griffin that he and his group are going to pack it up and move out, meaning that no midcourse correction number 2 will be required for the S-IVB. The midcourse correction number 1 for the third stage of the booster has placed it on a trajectory which is calculated to impact at - into the Moon at the desired point. Several of the Booster people will stand by to continue to monitor, but at this point everything looks and the majority of the people at that position will be ending a very long day for them and leaving the control center. To repeat, no midcourse correction number 2 will be required for the S-IVB. This is Mission Control, Houston.
009:36:50|T|S/C|[Music.]
009:45:58|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
009:46:01|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
009:46:04|C|Brand|It's time for Fred to start looking for the Earth, should be coming by in about a couple of minutes.
009:46:10|T|CDR|Okay. He's got his head out there right now.
009:46:14|T|LMP|Yeah. You've got that pretty well pegged, man. There it be.
009:46:21|C|Brand|Doesn't that give you confidence?
009:46:26|T|LMP|Yeah. I guess so. In a minute, you're going to hear my kitchen timer ding, and that also says the Earth is there.
009:46:39|C|Brand|Okay.
009:46:57|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by, Vance, for our countdown.
009:47:09|T|CDR|3, 2, 1 -
009:47:12|T|CDR|Mark.
009:47:15|C|Brand|Roger. We copy.
009:48:50|T|S/C|[Music. Hall of Montezuma]
009:49:51|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
009:49:54|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
009:49:56|C|Brand|Rog. We're enjoying Fred's music there.
009:50:04|T|CDR|Yeah, ... up here.
009:50:09|T|LMP|Yeah, I kind of like it too, Vance.
009:50:15|C|Brand|Yeah, we - we didn't hear much of it, though.
009:51:33|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Fred's music was a few bars from the Marine Corps Hymn. Obviously recorded on the on - one of the on board tape recorders. Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise is a former Marine aviator.
010:03:38|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 13.
010:03:41|C|Brand|13, Houston. Go ahead.
010:03:44|T|CMP|Okay, Vance, we did another EMS null bias test and the - it went from 100.0 to 101.8 in 100 seconds.
010:03:59|C|Brand|Roger. We copy.
010:06:09|C|Brand|13, Houston.
010:06:12|T|CMP|Go ahead, Vance.
010:06:13|C|Brand|Jack, like to verify, was that 100 to 100.8 or 101.8?
010:06:20|T|CMP|101.8.
010:06:23|C|Brand|Rog.
010:06:26|T|CMP|It was plus 100 to plus 101.8.
010:06:31|C|Brand|Rog.
010:07:57|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
010:08:01|T|CMP|Go ahead.
010:08:02|C|Brand|The Earth's coming up in the window again in 1 to 2 minutes.
010:08:08|T|CMP|He's got it. You're right again.
010:08:24|T|CMP|Okay, stand by for a mark here.
010:08:26|C|Brand|Rog.
010:08:38|T|CMP|Okay, ready? 3, 2, 1 -
010:08:40|T|CMP|Mark.
010:08:42|C|Brand|Roger, copy your mark.
010:09:06|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston. We have a CSM state vector to send you. Request P00 and Accept at your convenience.
010:09:28|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. There's P00 and Accept.
010:09:32|C|Brand|Okay, it's coming up.
010:11:30|C|Brand|13, the computer's yours again.
010:11:33|T|CMP|Okay, going back to Block.
010:11:35|C|Brand|Rog.
010:29:31|T|LMP|Looks like picture-taking time again.
010:29:50|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
010:29:53|T|LMP|Go ahead, Vance.
010:29:56|C|Brand|Okay, Earth should be coming into view.
010:30:01|T|LMP|Okay. I got it.
010:30:56|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by, Vance. 3, 2, 1 -
010:31:01|T|CMP|Mark.
010:31:03|C|Brand|Roger. We got it.
010:31:14|C|Brand|Earth starting to look pretty small now?
010:31:23|T|LMP|Well, looking at here, Vance, it's hard to be convinced it's even the Earth. All we see is water and clouds.
010:31:36|C|Brand|Well, I guess that's what we want. We want pictures of weather, right, clouds.
010:31:43|T|CMP|Yeah, about half of it's covered with clouds.
010:35:03|T|S/C|[Music.]
010:37:27|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 10 hours, 37 minutes. Apollo 13 is 52,141 nautical miles [96,565 km] from Earth. Velocity, 8,250 feet per second [2,515 m/s].

010:39:25|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 13.
010:39:28|C|Brand|This is Houston. Go ahead.
010:39:30|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. Are you copying the torquing angles of the P52 option 3?
010:39:45|C|Brand|That's affirm - that's affirm, but stand by.
010:39:51|T|CMP|Okay.
010:39:56|C|Brand|Okay. We've got 'em. Go ahead and torque 'em, Jack.
010:40:01|T|CMP|Okay. That was stars 20 and 27 and star-angle difference is five balls, and the time at torquing would be 10 hours, 40 minutes, 15 seconds.
010:40:15|C|Brand|1 hour [means 10 hours], 40 minutes and 15 seconds; 20 and 27 stars; and five balls. Roger.
010:51:33|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
010:51:37|T|CMP|Go ahead, Vance.
010:51:40|C|Brand|Time to look out your window for us again.
010:51:46|T|LMP|Lo and behold.
010:52:58|T|CMP|Okay. It's 3, 2, 1 -
010:53:01|T|CMP|Mark.
010:53:03|C|Brand|Roger. Copy.
010:59:08|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
010:59:12|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
010:59:13|C|Brand|Jim, we're coming up on a handover between sites. You might lose comm momentarily.
010:59:20|T|CDR|Okay. Understand handover, we might lose the comm.
010:59:23|C|Brand|Roger.
011:00:07|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 11 hours. That handover will be from Goldstone to Honeysuckle, taking place now. Apollo 13 is 53,925 nautical miles [99,869 km] from Earth, velocity 8,093 feet per second [2,467 m/s].
011:05:08|T|CDR|- post-docking checklist -
011:05:10|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. Real good.
011:13:52|C|MCC|Apollo 13, Houston.
011:13:55|T|CMP|Go ahead.
011:13:56|C|MCC|You should have the Earth coming into view here shortly.
011:14:02|T|LMP|Okay.
011:14:12|T|LMP|We got a new CapCom now.
011:14:29|C|Brand|No, I changed my voice.
011:14:58|T|CMP|3, 2, 1 -
011:15:01|T|CMP|Mark.
011:15:03|C|Brand|Roger. Copy.
011:15:08|T|CDR|That was negative, Houston. Say again.
011:15:12|C|Brand|We got your mark, Jim.
011:15:16|T|CDR|Okay.
011:16:53|T|LMP|Hey, you still there, Vance?
011:16:56|C|Brand|Rog. Go ahead.
011:16:59|T|LMP|I guess the world really does turn. I can see some of my landmasses now. It must be Australia down near the bottom and I guess we haven't really figured out what's over the - to the left. It must be some part of Asia. China, probably.
011:17:19|C|Brand|Hey, maybe the fact that you verified that the Earth really turns, we can call this Haise's Theory, huh?
011:17:32|T|CMP|Very good, Vance. Very good.
011:17:36|T|CDR|It's looking good for you, Vance.
011:17:39|C|Brand|No, seriously. Very interesting, we can see on the map now that you're between Guam and Hawaii and a little bit north, and you're almost out 60,000 miles [110,000 km].
011:17:58|T|CMP|Yeah. I just did a P21 and we had 55,900 [103,500 km].
011:18:08|C|Brand|Okay. That's pretty good.
011:18:12|T|CMP|I'll let you look at it again here.
011:18:24|C|Brand|Incidentally, we're looking at a replay of your TD&amp;E stuff here and the TV looks pretty good. First chance some of us had had to see it.
011:18:47|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. In R1, there's our altitude in tens of miles, 55,290 [102,400 km].
011:19:01|C|Brand|Okay.
011:20:14|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
011:20:18|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
011:20:19|C|Brand|Okay. Looking at our computations back here, we show you about 55,450 [nautical miles, 102,690 km] and going out rapidly now.
011:20:33|T|CDR|Well, HAL might be a little bit off.
011:20:36|C|Brand|Okay.
011:20:37|T|CMP|We have a sign underneath our LEB DSKY that 'my name is HAL.'
011:20:45|C|Brand|I can't imagine how that got there.  Just remember, you have to be nice to HAL.
011:20:56|T|CMP|We will.
011:21:04|T|CMP|I think this PTC's going to work out good. I been watching it here for the last hour here.
011:21:13|C|Brand|Good. It's looking good here.
011:21:44|C|Brand|Good Lord!
011:23:57|T|CDR|Houston, 13.
011:24:02|C|Brand|13, Houston. You're very weak. Please repeat.
011:24:07|T|CDR|Vance, to our calculations, we have taken about 10 Earth window photography pictures. I see nothing coming up here except to close the waste stowage vent here in a little while. I was thinking about getting squared away to bed down for the evening pretty soon.
011:24:35|C|Brand|Okay. That sounds good, Jim. FAO here would like to request just one more picture before you bed down, if you don't mind.
011:24:47|T|CDR|Okay. We'll come through with one more picture.
011:24:50|C|Brand|Okay.
011:30:33|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
011:30:38|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
011:30:40|C|Brand|A couple of items, Jim. The first is, the time for closing the waste stowage vent is 12:24. If you turn in before that time, why it's okay as far as we're concerned down here to close it before that time, just before you go to bed. The second point, we have some results on the P23s, and, if Jack's interested, we could give him the corrected altitudes we're getting, and so forth.
011:31:18|T|CMP|Yeah. I sure am, Vance.
011:31:26|C|Brand|Okay. This is preliminary results, but it will give you some indication. Corrected altitude is turning out to be 17 plus or minus 4 kilometers, and the fact that it's plus or minus 4 kilometers indicates that you're being very consistent in judging the altitude. The effective altitude is turning out to be 10 plus or minus 12 kilometers. Comments are that, as I said before, you're being consistent on the horizon selection. The substellar point error is averaging 15 arc-minutes and if you could hold the rates to a minimum, you might shoot for 5 arc-minutes. That's the only comment there. Over.
011:32:31|T|CMP|Okay. We'll try doing it better next time.
011:32:35|C|Brand|But, they're real satisfactory.
011:32:43|T|CMP|Okay. Thanks, Vance.
011:32:46|C|Brand|Rog.
011:35:30|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
011:35:33|T|CMP|Go ahead.
011:35:34|C|Brand|Okay, Jack, this is the last time for the Earth coming into view in about 1 to 2 minutes.
011:35:43|T|CMP|Okay. I got my photographer looking out there.
011:35:47|C|Brand|Okay.
011:35:59|C|Brand|13, Houston. I just corrected. Actually, the Earth will come into view more times. It's just that we're ... to the photography. Over.
011:36:12|T|CMP|Okay.
011:37:17|T|CMP|3, 2, 1 -
011:37:20|T|CMP|Mark.
011:37:23|C|Brand|Roger. We copy, and could you give us the frame number on that last picture, please?
011:37:31|T|LMP|Okay. We've been writing them all down, Vance, as we went, but that one turned out to be 29.
011:37:38|C|Brand|Roger. Twenty-nine, Fred.
011:37:46|T|LMP|Okay, Jack says I can't read the counter very well. It should be 28 based on our start frame.
011:37:54|C|Brand|Correction to 28.
011:38:09|C|Brand|13, Houston. Understand, though, the number showing that you read on the camera was 28. Is that affirm?
011:38:21|T|LMP|Yes. The readability of that thing is like, you know, half a frame one way or the other; so, 28, I think, is a good number.
011:38:27|C|Brand|Okay.
011:42:12|C|Brand|Roger. Houston copies.
011:42:23|T|LMP|I'll have to not wear it out before Jack gets there.
011:42:30|C|Brand|Sounds like that music's a pretty nice thing to have on a long voyage.
011:42:39|T|LMP|Yeah, you're right.
011:59:28|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
011:59:32|T|LMP|Go ahead.
011:59:34|C|Brand|Fred, did you get any Master Alarms up there about 5 or 10 minutes ago? Folks thought they saw some here and they were curious about it.
011:59:46|T|LMP|Ah, yeah. We got another O<sub>2</sub> Flow High on - I guess it was about 5 minutes ago.
011:59:57|C|Brand|Okay.
011:59:58|T|CMP|I think, Vance, what - what the people down there might have been seeing is our testing.
012:00:06|C|Brand|Rog. Testing the Caution and Warning?
012:00:13|T|CMP|Yeah. We were rigging a little siren device over the Master Alarm, and we were running a test on it.
012:00:20|C|Brand|Okay. Good enough. And anytime you're ready to copy, I've got a PAD, P37 block data.
012:00:32|T|LMP|Stand by.
012:01:21|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead, Vance.
012:01:24|C|Brand|Okay. P37 block data, starting with GET<sub>I</sub>. 025:00, 5119, minus 165, 071:08; 035:00, 7733, minus 165, 070:36; 045:00, 6208, minus 165, 094:52; 060:00, 5993, minus 165, 118:53. Over.
012:03:14|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by 1 minute.
012:03:27|T|LMP|Okay. 025:00, 5119, minus 165, 071:08; 035:00, 7733, minus 165, 070:36; 045:00, 6208, minus 165, 094:52; 060:00, 5993, minus 165, 118:53.
012:04:08|C|Brand|Rog. That's all correct.
012:04:14|T|LMP|Okay.
012:05:44|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 12 hours, 5 minutes. Apollo 13's distance from Earth now 58,828 nautical miles [108,949 km]. Velocity, 7,690 feet per second [2,344 m/s].
012:08:15|T|CDR|Houston, 13.
012:08:17|C|Brand|Roger. Go ahead.
012:08:20|T|CDR|We're starting our presleep checklist and no medication.
012:08:24|C|Brand|Okay. The Doc says very good.
012:08:38|T|CDR|And, Houston, is there any onboard readouts that you don't have from us.
012:08:50|C|Brand|Stand by 1. We need the LM/CM Delta-P for one thing, and I'll check back in a minute with the others.
012:09:00|T|CDR|Okay. And we still have the vent valve open. We'll close it one of the last things and I'm looking at LM/CM Delta-P right now and I see five-tenths in psi indicated.
012:09:14|C|Brand|Roger. Five-tenths.
012:09:37|C|Brand|13, Houston.
012:09:41|T|CDR|Go ahead.
012:09:42|C|Brand|Only other readouts we need are those on page 3-13 of the Flight Plan. Bat C, Pyro Bat A, Pyro Bat B, RCS A, B, C, and D readings, and DC Indicator select Main A or B.
012:10:07|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by.
012:10:49|T|LMP|And, Vance, we're still charging Bat B. Did you want to dispense with that in a few minutes?
012:11:06|C|Brand|Stand by on that, Fred.
012:11:13|T|CMP|Okay, Vance, I've got your readouts on page 3-13 of the Flight Plan.
012:11:17|C|Brand|Okay. Ready to copy.
012:11:20|T|CMP|Okay, Bat C is 37, Pyro Bat A is 37, Pyro Bat B is 37; RCS A, 94 percent; B, 95 percent; C, 93 percent; D, 96 percent.
012:11:41|C|Brand|Roger. Copy that.
012:12:23|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
012:12:28|T|LMP|Go ahead.
012:12:30|C|Brand|Okay. In answer to the battery-charging question, I calculate it should be fully charged at 12:35. Play that one, though, the same as the waste vent. If you want to do it earlier because you're turning in, why that's fine with us.
012:12:52|T|LMP|Okay, we'll continue on with a few other things we got to get done, and just before turning in, we'll check with you, and you can remind us then.
012:13:02|C|Brand|Okay.
012:17:17|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 13. Give me a call when you're ready for E-memory dump.
012:17:26|C|Brand|This is Houston, 13. You were weak. Please repeat.
012:17:30|T|CMP|Okay, Vance, give me a call when you're ready for our E-memory dump.
012:17:47|C|Brand|Okay, 13. We're not quite ready yet. We'll give you a call when we're ready.
012:19:14|C|Brand|Roger. Go ahead.
012:19:21|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. I understand you're ready.
012:19:26|C|Brand|Negative, GUIDO isn't quite ready yet.
012:19:32|T|CMP|Okay. I thought I heard you call us.
012:19:37|C|Brand|But we're ready now, Jack, so GUIDO says he's ready to take it.
012:19:47|T|CMP|On the way down.
012:19:48|C|Brand|Roger.
012:34:33|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 13.
012:34:38|C|Brand|13, Houston. Go.
012:34:41|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. Requesting clearance now to turn the vent valve back to Closed again, and also the battery charge, Off.
012:34:53|C|Brand|Roger. That's fine with us, Jim. Proceed.
012:34:56|T|CDR|Okay, we'll do that.
012:41:05|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
012:41:07|T|CMP|Go ahead, Vance.
012:41:13|C|Brand|We think the spacecraft's looking in good shape. Nobody has any comment down here before you hit the hay.
012:41:24|T|CMP|Okay. How do they think we stand on the way of consumables so far?
012:41:39|C|Brand|You're looking in good shape in all respects - consumables-wise.
012:41:47|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine.
012:47:37|C|Brand|13, Houston.
012:47:41|T|CMP|Go ahead, Vance.
012:47:43|C|Brand|Just the last comment, Jack. Would you clear HAL, please, so he doesn't burn his lights out there tonight?
012:47:51|T|CMP|No, I - I was just - Yeah, I will do this for you.
012:47:54|C|Brand|Okeydokes.
012:48:04|C|Brand|And we'll see you in the morning, huh?
012:48:07|T|CMP|Okay. It'll be just a minute or two yet. We have to finish up a couple more chores.
012:48:18|T|LMP|What do you mean? It is morning.
012:48:22|C|Brand|Hey, that's right.
012:48:42|C|Brand|It's been a long day, huh?
012:48:45|T|CMP|Yeah, it sure was.
013:08:04|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 13 hours, 8 minutes. We don't anticipate any further conversation with the crew tonight. At least we do not intend to put in any more calls to them. Apollo 13 crew settling down for a 10-hour rest period. Apollo 13 is 63,312 nautical miles [117,254 km] from Earth; velocity, 7,358 feet per second [2,243 m/s]. We'll take the release line down now. Come back up approximately in an hour with a status report. If there is further conversation, we'll come back up and bring that to you. This is Mission Control, Houston.
013:57:41|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 13 hours, 57 minutes. The White Team, lead by Flight Director Gene Kranz, is in the process of taking over here in the Control Center relieving the Gold Team, led by Gerry Griffin. Apollo 13 is 66,738 nautical miles [123,599 kilometres] from Earth; velocity, 7,123 feet per second [2,171 metres per second]. We had no conversation with the crew for the past hour. They have started a 10-hour rest period. Been a fairly quiet shift. At the beginning of the shift, the crew was performing program 23, cislunar navigation, taking star markings with the sextant. That went very well. They established a Passive Thermal Control mode and had to re-establish it a little bit later as the initial PTC was not well established. It has been performing very well since it was re-established. For a period of several hours the Apollo 13 crew photographed the Earth's weather. One photograph every 20 minutes. Midcourse correction number 1 was not performed by the spacecraft. Midcourse correction number 1 for the S-IVB, the third stage of the booster, was performed just prior to the Gold Team coming on shift this evening at 6 hours Elapsed Time. Midcourse correction number 2 was scheduled for 9 hours. However, tracking determined that midcourse correction number 2 for the S-IVB was not required. And the S-IVB is expected to impact the lunar surface in the area that is desired at about 77 hours, 49 minutes. The impact time will continue to be updated throughout the translunar coast period. Just prior to saying goodnight to the crew, we did have a report from spacecraft commander Jim Lovell that the crew had taken no medication thus far in the mission. And we reported to the crew that all spacecraft consumables are in good shape. 14 hours, 1 minute; this is Mission Control, Houston.
014:33:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 14 hours, 33 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Our digital displays presently show Apollo 13 traveling at a speed of 6,923 feet per second [2,110 m/s], and at a distance away from Earth of 68,941 nautical miles [127,679 km]. The White Team of flight controllers have settled into their respective console positions. The atmosphere in Mission Control, at the present time, could be described as quiet, business-like, since the crew entered their rest period some hour and a half to two hours ago. Flight Director Gene Kranz, as is traditionally done, went around the room talking to each member of his flight control team following their changeover. Jack Lousma is presently filling the position of Capsule Communicator, however we would not expect to hear from Mr. Lousma assuming that the mission continues on its present Flight Plan. The report from Flight Surgeon during this around-the-room period indicated - the Flight Surgeon indicated that he felt all three crewmen were settled in and sleeping at the present time. He is recording data on the Lunar Module Pilot, and his data indicated that Fred Haise went to sleep at 13 hours, 30 minutes into the mission; some one hour ago. We're now at 14 hours, 35 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
015:33:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 15 hours, 33 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Our digital displays presently show the Apollo 13 spacecraft at 73,035 nautical miles [135,261 km] away from Earth; now travelling at a velocity of 6,731 feet per second [2,052 m/s]. With the crew now well into its - into their rest period, here in Mission Control we have not attempted to contact them. Continuing to monitor at 15 hours, 34 minutes into the flight; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
016:23:36|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 16 hours, 24 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Our digital displays presently show Apollo 13 at 76,311 nautical miles [141,328 km] away from Earth. Continuing to slow down, now showing a velocity of 6,551 feet per second [1,997 m/s]. Meanwhile during this quiet period in the Mission Control Center, the White Team of flight controllers, headed by Flight Director Gene Kranz, are taking this opportunity to watch a television replay of the Transposition and Docking phase of the mission which took place yesterday afternoon. We're at 16 hours, 25 minutes into the flight. Continuing to monitor; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
017:23:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 17 hours, 23 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Our digital displays presently show the Apollo 13 spacecraft at 79,919 nautical miles [148,010 km] away from Earth, and travelling at a velocity of 6,350 feet per second [1,935 m/s]. We've had no voice communications or contact with Apollo 13 crewmen Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, or Fred Haise, since they started their rest period. Meanwhile, this has provided a period of quiet planning in the Mission Control Center. One of the items being planned, midcourse correction number 2, will pass along preliminary planning numbers for you now. We're presently looking at a Ground Elapsed Time of 30 hours, 40 minutes, 57 seconds for MCC-2, with a Delta-V or a velocity [change] of 23 feet per second [7 m/s]. This, of course, will be performed with the Service Propulsion System of the Command Module and with a burn duration now planned of 3.25 seconds. Of course, these numbers will be reviewed and updated as the mission progresses. We're now at 17 hours, 25 minutes into the flight of Apollo 13 and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
018:22:01|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 18 hours, 22 minutes since the start of the Apollo 13 mission. We now show Apollo 13 83,396 nautical miles [154,449 km] out from Earth, traveling now at a speed of 6,157 feet per second [1,877 m/s]. At this time, the Apollo 13 crew continues in their rest period and meanwhile in Mission Control we will continue to monitor for any conversations or transmissions if they - in the unlikely event they should occur. We're at 83 hours [sic], 23 minutes into the flight; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
019:22:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 19 hours, 22 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. We've just concluded another silent hour in Mission Control Center as the Apollo 13 crew is still sleeping. Meanwhile, backup commander John Young has joined Jack Lousma at the Capsule Communicator's console. At this point, we'll relay some flight dynamics data developed during this period of relative inactivity. Apollo 13 will reach its mid-point in its trip to the Moon, in terms of distance, at an altitude of 112,070 nautical miles [207,554 km]. This will occur at a Ground Elapsed Time of 27 hours, 20 minutes, 49 seconds. The spacecraft's velocity relative to the Moon will be 4,207 feet per second [1,282 m/s]. Relative to the Earth, its velocity will be 4,990 feet per second [1,521 m/s]. Apollo 13 will be at its mid-way point in terms of time and our point of reference here is the Lunar Orbit Insertion, now forecast to occur at 77 hours, 26 minutes, 12 seconds. Its mid-way point would be at a Ground Elapsed Time of 38 hours, 43 minutes, 06 seconds. At that point, Apollo 13 will be at an altitude of 85,684 nautical miles [158,687 km] away from the Moon and traveling away from the Earth at a distance of 141,764 nautical miles [262,547 km]. Its velocity relative to the Moon, 3,776 feet per second [1,151 m/s]; its velocity relative to the Earth, 4,098 feet per second [1,249 m/s]. Apollo 13 should go into the lunar sphere of influence at Ground Elapsed Time of 62 hours, 49 minutes, zero seconds. Its distance, at that time, away from the Moon will be 33,821 nautical miles [62,636 km]. Distance away from the Earth, 190,713 nautical miles [353,200 km], and traveling at a velocity of 3,641 feet per second [1,110 m/s] relative to the Moon, and 3,025 feet per second [922 m/s] relative to the Earth. We are now at 19 hours, 25 minutes into the flight of Apollo 13; and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
020:22:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 20 hours, 22 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Our display now shows the Apollo 13 spacecraft at 90,380 nautical miles [167,384 km] away from Earth, continuing to slow down; its velocity presently reading 5,843 feet per second [1,781 m/s]. Meanwhile in the Mission Control one of our multi-purpose countdown clocks shows that the Apollo 13 crew has 2 hours, 37 minutes remaining in their rest period. We're at 20 hours, 23 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
020:24:21|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. We wish to make an announcement that the writer pool meeting - this is a writer pool for the Missions Operations Control Moon - Room - is getting under way at the present time in the small auditorium in building 1. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
021:21:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 21 hours, 21 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Apollo 13 is now 93,640 nautical miles [173,421 km] away from Earth; its velocity now reading 5,699 feet per second [1,737 m/s]. There's 1 hour, 38 minutes remaining for the rest period of Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise. Based on Madrid tracking of the S-IVB, we're presently predicting a point of impact of 8 degrees, 35 minutes south; 33 degrees, 54 minutes west at a Ground Elapsed Time of 77 hours, 51 minutes, 32 seconds. These are very early numbers and subject to considerable refinement through further tracking. We're at 21 hours, 22 minutes; continuing to monitor; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
021:55:20|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 21 hours, 55 minutes since lift-off. Apollo 13 is presently 95,511 nautical miles [176,886 km] out from Earth and now traveling at a speed of 5,620 feet per second [1,713 m/s]. In Mission Control Center, we're now experiencing a changeover in flight control teams. The Lunney team has reported aboard, replacing Gene Kranz's team of flight controllers. At the Capsule Communicator position, Joe Kerwin is in now in place of Jack Lousma. For the entire shift we had no contact with the crew as they were in a rest period. Jack Lousma although he served as our capsule communicator, can be distinguished by the fact he had absolutely nothing to say over the loop this morning. We're at 21 hours, 56 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
023:11:14|T|CDR|Hello, Houston. Houston, Apollo 13. Over.
023:11:17|C|Kerwin|Good morning, 13. This is Houston. How are you?
023:11:22|T|CDR|Read you loud and clear, and we had a fairly good night's sleep.
023:11:32|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real fine. At your leisure, you can give us radiation reports, I guess. And, we're getting a consumables update together for you, and a few other little details whenever you're ready to talk. About the only major thing on the spacecraft is that it's been getting farther away.
023:11:51|T|CDR|Okay. Well, that's to be expected, I guess.
023:11:54|C|Kerwin|Yeah.
023:12:06|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 23 hours, 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 13 now 99,589 nautical miles [184,438 km] out from Earth; velocity continuing to decelerate, now showing 5,453 feet per second [1,662 m/s] in velocity. Spacecraft Commander Jim Lovell just called Houston about - oh, some 12 minutes past the scheduled wake-up time. It had been decided here in Mission Control to let the crew sleep as long as they wanted to this morning because it's rather a relaxed day. We'll play back the tape now of this first few sentences of conversation and rejoin any subsequent conversation live.
023:15:38|T|LMP|And we're starting to charge battery A, Houston.
023:15:44|C|Kerwin|Rog on battery A, Fred. EECOM says battery B looks real good.
023:15:51|T|LMP|Okay.
023:16:46|T|CDR|Houston, 13.
023:16:48|C|Kerwin|Go ahead.
023:16:51|T|CDR|Okay. For information, Fred was on comm last night; and he was over in the left-hand seat, and if you want our radiation readings, we just goofed. We left them all in the suits which are now nicely tucked away. We're going to get out Jack's suit in an hour or so anyway, and we'll get his dosimeter out if you wanted to get the reading on that one.
023:17:13|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. That'll be satisfactory.
023:17:17|T|CDR|Okay.
023:17:18|C|Kerwin|And in exchange for that, the Surgeon would like to have a rough number of hours each of you slept and a qualitative verb to describe whether it was good, fair, or poor.
023:17:30|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by.
023:17:46|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We had an average of around 5&frac12; hours sleep ... last night ...
023:18:06|C|Kerwin|Jim, Houston. Your comm got pretty garbled there just as you started to talk.
023:18:38|T|CDR|Okay. Houston, Apollo 13.
023:18:40|C|Kerwin|Okay, 13. You're loud and clear again.
023:18:45|T|CDR|We averaged about 5 1/2; hours sleep apiece, and we're estimating that the sleep was good.
023:18:53|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that.  Let's see what else we got for you, Jim. Midcourse-2 looks like about 23 feet per second [7 m/s], approximately retrograde and on time. And it's holding real firm there. For your information, and you don't need to copy this down, because it's still pretty soft, but we have an S-IVB impact of about 8.57 south and about 33.9 west, which is a little west and a little south of the Flight Plan value. We have it at a GET of about 77 plus 51 which is just before AOS, and the LOI paths are a little bit late, and as I say, it's still pretty soft, and we'll be updating you with firm numbers.
023:19:57|T|CDR|That's fine, Joe. Just as long as it doesn't hit Cone Crater.
023:20:02|C|Kerwin|Okay. And I'll have a consumables update for you in a little while, and I have a small Flight Plan update for you sometime a little later on when you're ready to copy. There's no big deals in it.
023:20:19|T|CDR|Roger.
023:20:23|C|Kerwin|And, 13, Houston. We'd like to verify that you cycled the O<sub>2</sub> cryo fans. We saw the H<sub>2</sub>, but we didn't see the O<sub>2</sub> get stirred up.
023:20:35|T|CMP|Yeah, Joe. We did and - kind of looked like we might have had a little stratification because right after we put them on, we had a Cryo Press light.
023:20:45|C|Kerwin|Okay. EECOM told me that might happen, and he was right.
023:21:54|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. We're ready to copy a Flight Plan update and your consumables.
023:22:00|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack.  The Flight Plan update has a couple of items in it, and the first one we'd like to do is to update the T<sub>ephem</sub> values in the G&amp;C checklist on page G/9-2. These are fairly small changes, but in case you need them, we'd like you to have the exact numbers. Over.
023:22:25|T|CMP|Okay. Just a minute. I'll get it out.
023:22:56|T|CMP|Joe, was that the G&amp;C checklist, page 9-2?
023:23:00|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative. G&amp;C, page G/9-2.
023:23:08|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
023:23:09|C|Kerwin|Okay. On that page in line 04, column B, change the number from 03366 to 05253. Over.
023:23:30|T|CMP|05253.
023:23:31|C|Kerwin|Okay. And in line 05, column B, change from 11000 to 33661. Over.
023:23:47|T|CMP|33661.
023:23:50|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's right. The only other thing I've got for you, Jack, is three additional questions for the booster systems debriefing, which is to take place at about 25 hours, and we thought we'd pass these questions up to you early so you can consider them. Over.
023:24:12|T|CDR|Okay. We're ready to copy.
023:24:15|C|Kerwin|Okay. The first extra is, and let me get the original question because this question says, &quot;More specifically on item 2,&quot; and item 2 says, &quot;Were there any significant changes in the noise vibration level during the single stage of powered flight? Specifically, describe your observations during the early S-II center engine cut-off, and approximately 90 seconds prior to TLI cut-off, you reported a high vibration in the S-IVB. We'd like you to describe the build-up of this vibration and its behavior through cut-off.&quot; Over.
023:25:02|T|CDR|Okay. Essentially, what you'd like us to talk about is vibration sequence during the early S-II cut-off of the center engine and also describe the vibrations that we encountered during the S-IVB TLI burn. Is that correct?
023:25:17|C|Kerwin|That's it. Okay. The second extra question is for you, Jim, and it says, &quot;Comparing this flight with your ride on Apollo 8, were there any significant differences in the powered flight environment?&quot;
023:25:35|T|CDR|Okay. We'll describe a comparison with 8 and 13 as far as powered flight goes.
023:25:41|C|Kerwin|Roger. And the last additional question is what did the ORDEAL ball look like during TLI? As you know, we passed you an update to that setting, and we'd like to know whether it was riding right on zero or what during the burn. Over.
023:26:00|T|CDR|Okay. Will do. Well we'll describe the ORDEAL ball.
023:26:03|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's it, and that's the whole Flight Plan update. I have a consumables update now if you want to listen to that.
023:26:12|T|CDR|Okay, Joe. We're ready to copy.
023:26:14|C|Kerwin|Okay. At 23 hours, the total RCS is 1121, quad A is 274, quad Bravo is 286, quad Charlie is 274, quad Delta is 287; and the cryos are as follows: H<sub>2</sub> tank 1, 83 percent; H<sub>2</sub> tank 2, 86 percent; O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, 87 percent; O<sub>2</sub> tank 2, 87 percent. Over.
023:27:07|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. We got all those, and how do we compare them with where we should be in the timeline?
023:27:15|C|Kerwin|As I understand it, Jack, you're running slightly ahead of nominal in both those areas.
023:27:24|T|CMP|Okay; real fine.
023:27:25|C|Kerwin|No problems.
023:28:07|C|Kerwin|And, 13, Houston. That's all the business I got right now. I have a little news plan of the day for you, if you feel like listening to that a little later on.
023:28:30|T|CDR|Just hold off there, Joe, until Fred's on his headset.
023:28:36|C|Kerwin|Stand by one, Jim. You're coming in garbled again.
023:29:58|T|CMP|Houston, 13.
023:30:00|C|Kerwin|Okay, 13; Houston. Loud and clear again. Go ahead.
023:30:05|T|CMP|Okay. Joe. On the news, Jim would like to hold off a little bit on that, and I want to make a request to FAO, if he will at some time during the day, when we have a - get a Flight Plan update with those activities we agreed to make optional during lunar orbit and the few activities we were going to delete, I think that I forgot and left that card back during the press of suiting, I left it in the suit room.
023:30:35|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. I understand FAO's working on that and we'll have something for you later on.
023:30:42|T|CMP|Okay. We're not in any hurry.
023:30:45|C|Kerwin|Rog.
023:47:00|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; 13.
023:47:11|C|Kerwin|Okay. Jack. We copy the angles. You can go ahead and torque them.
023:47:24|T|CMP|Okay. Joe. The time of torquing will be 23 hours, 47 minutes, 30 seconds.
023:47:30|C|Kerwin|We copy.
023:54:45|T|CDR|Houston, 13.
023:54:48|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
023:54:51|T|CDR|For information, Joe, we're all configured back again now to our regular seating positions, if you're monitoring us.
023:54:59|C|Kerwin|Okay. Thank you, Jim.
024:04:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control; continuing to monitor the air/ground from Apollo 13. Crew now in breakfast period. About an hour from now, the launch vehicle's systems performance debriefing will be carried out between the crew of Apollo 13 and the flight controllers here in the Mission Control room. Additional questions, over the ones that were preplanned and included in the Flight Plan, will be passed to the crew from the Booster systems engineer; the philosophy being that many of the debriefing items can be carried on in flight during rather quiet periods of the coast phases of the flight, and thereby reduce the amount of debriefing done after recovery. Spacecraft now 102,342 nautical miles [189,537 km] out from Earth. Velocity now 5,345 feet per second [1,629 m/s]. Ground Elapsed Time now at 24 hours, 5 minutes. Apollo Control continuing to stay live in anticipation of the morning news being read up by spacecraft communicator Joe Kerwin to the crew and a rather quiet day all in all. Coming up at 30 hours and 40 minutes with midcourse correction burn number 2 which is the hybrid transfer maneuver to take the spacecraft out of the free return trajectory and place it in a non-free return, but still within the capability of the propulsion systems of the spacecraft to get back onto a free return. Pericynthion, should this maneuver not be made, would be 252 nautical miles [467 km] above the Moon. Post burn, it's more in the neighborhood of 60.2 nautical miles [111.5 km] if the maneuver is done on time and with the desired velocity change. 24 hours, 6 minutes; continuing to stand by.
024:16:02|T|CDR|Hello there, Houston; 13.
024:16:08|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
024:16:12|T|CDR|Gosh, we had forgotten, but we'd like to hear what the news is.
024:16:15|C|Kerwin|Okay. There's not a whole lot to it. Well, let's see, we'll start with the - Let's start with sports, what the heck. The Astros survived 8 to 7, the Braves got five or six runs in the - five runs in the ninth inning, but they just - they just made it; and in the other important game of the day, the Cubs were rained out. I have all the rest of the scores, you can tell me if you want any of them. They had earthquakes in Manila and other areas of the island of Luzon. There were three tremors and they kept the buildings shaking for about a half an hour or so, and it was about a 5 on the Richter scale. Okay, let's see. The Beatles have announced they will no longer perform as a group. The quartet is reported to have made in excess of a half billion dollars during their short musical career. However, rumors that they will use this money to start their own space program are false.
024:17:24|T|CDR|Maybe we could borrow some.
024:17:26|C|Kerwin|[Laughter.] Okay. Okay; West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who witnessed your launch from the Cape yesterday, and President Nixon will complete their round of talks today. Brandt reportedly came to the U.S. to seek assurance from the President to go ahead with talks with the eastern European nations, especially East Germany, Poland, and Russia. Many air traffic controllers are still out, but reports indicate that they are slowly returning to work, and you'll be happy to know that the controllers here in the MOCR are still on the job.
024:18:04|T|CDR|Great, great.
024:18:05|C|Kerwin|Go ahead.
024:18:09|T|CDR|I said thank goodness for that.
024:18:10|C|Kerwin|Okay. Some truck lines are being struck in the Midwest, and the school teachers have walked off the job in Minneapolis. Today's favorite pastime across the - Uh oh; have you guys completed your income tax?
024:18:28|T|CDR|How do I apply for an extension?
024:18:31|C|Kerwin|[Laughter.]
024:18:32|T|CMP|Yeah, Joe. I got to - hey, listen - It ain't too funny; things kind of happened real fast down there, and I do need an extension.
024:18:43|C|Kerwin|[Laughter.]
024:18:44|T|CMP|I didn't get mine filed. I'm really serious; would you -
024:18:47|C|Kerwin|You're breaking up the room down here.
024:18:49|T|CMP|- because I may be spending time in a -
024:18:51|C|Kerwin|We'll see -
024:18:52|T|CMP|I may be spending time in a - I may be spending time in another quarantine besides the one that they are planning for me.
024:18:59|C|Kerwin|We'll see what we can do, Jack. We'll get with Recovery and see if we can get the agent out there in the Pacific when you come back. By golly, let's see. In professional basketball, the Nicks beat the Milwaukee Bucks 110 to 102, and Billy Casper is leading the Masters after 54 holes with a 208, and spring football practice is in full swing. And that's about all the news we got; the updated plan of the day for you guys, the uniform will be service dress inflight coverall garments with swords and medals, and tonight's movie shown in the Lower Equipment Bay will be John Wayne, Lou Costello, and Shirley Temple in the 'The Flight of Apollo 13.' Over.
024:19:50|T|CDR|Outstanding.
024:20:06|T|CDR|Houston, this is 13. Is it true that Jack's income tax return was going to be used to buy the ascent fuel for the LM?
024:20:18|C|Kerwin|Well, considering that he's a bachelor and hasn't got that deduction to take, yeah!
024:20:29|T|CMP|Hey, Joe. I'm glad you brought that up, because I was really serious about that.
024:20:36|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. We'll - We'll - we'll take care of it. Tom Stafford says he'll get an extension for you.
024:20:43|T|CMP|Okay.
024:20:50|C|Kerwin|And Jim McDivitt says, &quot;yeah, now that you mention it, he forgot to fill the ascent stage.
024:21:00|T|CDR|[Laughter.] Suspicions confirmed.
024:21:04|C|Kerwin|Should give you very good performance on descent.
024:21:11|T|CMP|We should have a lot more hover time, huh?
024:21:13|C|Kerwin|That's right.
024:21:23|C|Kerwin|Okay, crew. About the only other thing I've got for you right now is an update to your P37 PAD for Lift-off plus 35. This is a change to the PAD we gave you yesterday. The reason for the update is for weather avoidance in the mid-Pacific landing area at 70 hours, which is the return time for this PAD, and in case the question arises in your mind, we don't expect any problem there for the end of the mission. The weather area is 20 degrees south of your end-of-mission landing point, and it appears to be moving to the south.
024:22:01|T|CDR|Okay, Joe. I'm ready to copy the PAD.
024:22:03|C|Kerwin|Okay. GET of ignition is 035:00; Delta-V<sub>T</sub>, 7883; Longitude, minus 155; and the GET 400K, 069:54. Over.
024:22:28|T|CDR|GET<sub>I</sub> is 035:00, 7883, minus 155, 069:54.
024:22:39|C|Kerwin|Okay.
024:23:17|T|CDR|And, Houston, Jack's going to try donning his suit now for practice, himself, and when he gets it out, we'll give you a dosimeter reading.
024:23:26|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real good.
024:41:49|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 13.
024:41:51|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go.
024:41:55|T|CDR|Okay. We've retrieved Jack's dosimeter, and it's reading 02022.
024:42:07|C|Kerwin|Okay. We copy 02022 on the dosimeter, Jim.
024:42:14|T|CDR|That's affirm.
024:42:31|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. At your convenience, we'd like the LM/CM Delta-P reading.
024:42:37|T|CDR|That reading is 0.65 psi.
024:42:42|C|Kerwin|Copy 0.65. Thank you.
025:10:56|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
025:10:58|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 13. Roger. We're thinking together. And we're here waiting for your call.
025:11:07|C|Kerwin|Okay, you were a little broken up there, Jim, but I think it's getting better. We're ready for the launch vehicle systems debriefing whenever you are.
025:11:31|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; Apollo 13. You were cut out again; say again, please.
025:11:35|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jim. We're ready for the launch vehicle systems debriefing whenever you are. Over.
025:11:43|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by 1.
025:12:00|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; 13. In answer to question 1, the changes in the noise level occurred mainly between the first stage and the other stages - the other stages were about the same in noise level, very quiet, but the first stage, of course, was - made quite a bit of noise in the beginning but - which built up during the high Q, and then went - went quiet just after high Q.
025:12:31|C|Kerwin|Okay, copy that, Jim.
025:12:37|T|CDR|I might mention that the noise level during the first stage was not sufficient to be uncomfortable at all.
025:12:46|C|Kerwin|Roger. And I assume comm was okay.
025:12:50|T|CDR|That's affirm. Comm was very good all during - throughout the entire flight. Much better than I expected.
025:12:57|C|Kerwin|Okay.
025:13:04|T|CDR|Now, in answer to question 2, there was, of course, a vibration transient in the second stage that - due to the number 5 engine going out - which occurred shortly before the engine went out, and slightly after that then the S-II stage was very smooth.
025:13:33|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. I guess the significant point there is that you did notice the vibration before you saw the engine light.
025:13:41|T|CDR|That's right. We - we noticed the vibration but it wasn't such that we thought something catastrophic was going to happen; it just started vibration and then the EN light came on, and then the vibration went away and the stage itself was just smooth.
025:13:59|C|Kerwin|Okay, copy that.
025:14:03|T|LMP|Yeah, and that - it was all pretty - pretty short in span - just a second or so before and like a second afterwards, Joe.
025:14:14|C|Kerwin|Oh. Roger.
025:14:18|T|CDR|And on the S-IVB, the vibration of the vehicle itself was about the same as powered flight - a very high frequency vibration.
025:14:33|C|Kerwin|That was - was that during - just during TLI, or did you notice that at insertion?
025:14:45|T|CDR|Well, it was a high-frequency viola - vibration but more noticeable during the TLI burn than it was during the boost phase of flight.
025:14:59|C|Kerwin|Okay, I - understand.
025:15:13|T|LMP|I guess the S-IVB vibration during TLI was there all the time although it seemed to - to grow to us as the burn progressed, although that may have been just due to the boost weight decrease.
025:15:30|C|Kerwin|Okay, you called this about 3&frac12; minutes, but I guess the thing was slowly building up throughout the whole burn. Right?
025:15:37|T|LMP|That's right.
025:15:40|C|Kerwin|Okay, was it uncomfortable or did it cause your vision to degrade or anything like that?
025:15:49|T|CDR|No, it - it was not uncomfortable at all but I was recalling the ride on 8, and the S-IVB was more - much more smooth on 8 than it was on 13.
025:15:59|C|Kerwin|Copy that.
025:16:24|T|CDR|Okay, now, in answer to number 3, we did not experience any unexpected transients except that all of us noticed the PU shift. We thought it was more pronounced than we had expected it to be.
025:16:39|C|Kerwin|Okay. Understand.
025:16:42|T|CMP|Joe, on that. I guess most of every time that PU shift occurred we all - almost all of us glanced at the engine light. We could feel definite acceleration change.
025:16:53|C|Kerwin|Rog. Understand, Jack.
025:16:58|T|CDR|And, during the high-Q portion of the flight, the Alpha meter, to my knowledge, never went above 25 percent.
025:17:06|C|Kerwin|Okay.
025:17:14|T|CDR|In answer to number 4, we got a pretty good look at the thermal shroud and the IU after taking the LM away, and from our viewpoint, the shroud was completely intact. I saw no loose particles or parts of it floating at all.
025:17:30|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. Understand.
025:17:40|T|CDR|And, I guess we answered number 5. I don't think at any time did we have any communication problem during powered flight.
025:17:45|C|Kerwin|Roger.
025:17:59|T|CDR|In answer to number 6, the answer is essentially no. We saw no venting or suspected leak on the LM or the CSM.
025:18:14|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. I guess you described to us the nonpropulsive venting on the S-IVB after the APS maneuver and we copied that at the time.
025:18:30|T|CDR|Okay. Fred saw the S-IVB venting.
025:18:33|T|LMP|Yes, we had already talked about that, Joe. And that was also visible when it - of course, when it did its evasive maneuver when we were looking at it right close up.
025:18:44|C|Kerwin|Roger.
025:19:12|T|CDR|Okay, Joe. The last time we saw the S-IVB positively was when Fred saw it venting at about - at about 5 hours. We think we might have picked it up later on. We saw a particle or something out there that was tumbling which might have been the booster or one of the SLA panels.
025:19:34|C|Kerwin|And when was that, Jim?
025:19:41|T|CDR|We're - we're debating. It was somewhere between - say 7:30 and 9 hours.
025:19:47|C|Kerwin|Okay.
025:19:50|T|LMP|But, Joe, assuming the S-IVB is still stable. The object I was looking at was definitely tumbling.
025:20:01|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. As I recall, it was stable then, although it's tumbling now.
025:20:08|T|LMP|Okay. It probably was the SLA panel I picked up.
025:20:14|C|Kerwin|Right. Incidentally, I guess the guys in building 6 -
025:20:17|T|CDR|Oh and I think we -
025:20:18|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, Jim.
025:20:19|T|CDR|I - I think we answered number 9. We - at around 5:32, I think, was when we think the number 5 light came on in the S-II, and a definite vibration which was more than just a high-frequency vibration we got with the normal S-IV burn, and then the light came on. I called ENCO thinking from the training that it was 7:42 and looked up at the time and realized it was early. And then, soon after the light came on, the vibration stopped and the engine or the booster smoothed down. It was very smooth from there on.
025:20:59|C|Kerwin|Okay. This may be a stupid question, but do you have any idea of what the frequency of it was?
025:21:08|T|CDR|Only to say that it was much higher - I couldn't really guess now. It was rather a rapid longitudinal vibration.
025:21:23|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. Stand by now for a minute, we're going to switch omni.
025:22:48|T|CDR|Houston, 13, ...
025:22:51|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. I read you. We still have quite a bit of noise on the loop.
025:22:59|T|CDR|I'll stand by. Roger.
025:23:04|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. It should be pretty good now. We copied you answering question number 9.
025:23:16|T|CDR|Do you want any more comments on the S-IVB vibration?
025:23:20|C|Kerwin|I don't think so. When you get all done, I'll - I'll make a quick check to see if the booster people have any - any additional questions. You skipped number 8, Jim; could you go back to that for a second?
025:23:34|T|CDR|Okay, stand by.
025:23:54|T|CDR|Our only comment there, Joe, was that the burn on TLI, to our knowledge, was about 3&frac34; second longer than had been predicted and that was the only thing that we really noticed; otherwise, looked like V<sub>I</sub> was nominal at cut-off.
025:24:11|C|Kerwin|Okay, understand.
025:24:23|T|CDR|Okay, on comparing the flight of 13 to Apollo 8, lift-off was about the same amount of vibration as I noticed on 8, but at the beginning of the flight, there was less of the sideways motion than we experienced on Apollo 8. The S-IC separation felt more violent on 13 than it did on 8, maybe that's because I was in a different seat, I don't know. But there was about three sharp transients of the cut-off and a couple of big bangs where we were thrown backwards longitudinally on our straps before the S-II went off. And the S-II was, of course, just as smooth on 13 as 8 except for the number 5 engine. And we did not experience the vibration that we experienced on 8 towards the end of the S-II burn. And the S-IVB was - had more vibration than we had on 8.
025:25:31|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim, got all that.
025:25:39|T|CDR|The up - the update on the ORDEAL ball was a good one. At the burn, we were about - just about 8 degrees. We had to pitch down. The yaw was right on, all the way through the entire burn, and just towards the end of the burn, the ball started going back in pitch a little bit.
025:26:03|C|Kerwin|Okay, sounds good, we'll give Mike Wash a gold star on that one.  Okay, Jim, stand by 1 while I see if we have any extra questions.
025:26:44|C|Kerwin|Jim, while we're waiting to see if they have any more questions, I'd like to read you the booster people's preliminary analysis on the - the S-II cut-off. Over.
025:26:58|T|CDR|That's very interesting. Go ahead.
025:27:00|C|Kerwin|Okay, preliminary analysis of the data indicates that the center S-II engine vibrated at a somewhat higher amplitude than we've seen on previous flights, and it started at about 160 seconds into the S-II burn. As a result of these vibrations, the engine chamber pressure decreased to the level where the two low-level thrust sensors, the thrust-okay sensors, initiated center engine cut-off. Early evaluation of data indicates that no damage occurred to the engine, and the cause of the increased vibration amplitude is still under investigation. Over.
025:27:44|T|CDR|I'm glad it was the center engine.
025:27:48|C|Kerwin|Yeah, right.
025:27:58|T|CDR|Joe, do you have any word on what marks we had for TLI?
025:28:04|C|Kerwin|At the time of TLI, as I recall, you had 6 seconds longer than the nominal burn which was 3 seconds longer than the 3-sigma low burn, and you were also Go for a second-opportunity TLI if we had required one.
025:28:24|T|CDR|Okay, we were just wondering because it appeared to us that we had a longer TLI burn than had been predicted.
025:28:30|C|Kerwin|Yes, you did. We confirmed that - that - that cut-off time just about as you saw it, and I don't have an explanation for it, but it was within the 3-sigma margins.
025:29:47|C|Kerwin|13, Houston.
025:29:49|T|CDR|Go ahead.
025:29:51|C|Kerwin|Roger, we have no further questions. All the answers were clear and satisfactory, and we thank you very much. You can press on with the rest of your busy day.
025:30:02|T|CDR|Right-o.
025:31:50|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The Launch Vehicle Systems Debriefing has just concluded. No further questions from the Booster controllers pass through spacecraft communicator Joe Kerwin. Apollo 13 now 106,747 nautical miles [197,695 km] out from Earth; velocity continuing to slow down, now 5,179 feet per second [1,579 m/s]. The spacecraft will reach the midpoint in distance where it's equally far from the Earth to the spacecraft or from the spacecraft to the Moon at a Ground Elapsed Time of 27 hours, 20 minutes, 49 seconds. At that time it will be 112,070 nautical miles [207,554 km] both ways to the Earth and to the Moon. Continuing to stand by on the air-to-ground circuit for further conversation.
026:29:08|T|LMP|And, Houston; 13.
026:29:13|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
026:29:18|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. Out window 5, I just picked up the tumbling object again so, for sure, it must have been a SLA panel. I don't think we could still be in the proximity of the S-IV at this time.
026:29:33|C|Kerwin|I don't think so, Fred. It's several hundred miles aft of you. 700 miles is - is the number, I'm told. And since the SLA panel didn't make the midcourse correction, that might be it.
026:29:51|T|LMP|Yes, it's - I can't really tell for sure even through the monocular that it is, but it looks the same relative position to the stars. And the best I can tell, about the same intensity and still about the same distance from us.
026:30:11|C|Kerwin|Can you see it tumbling. Does it have a shape, or is it a point?
026:30:19|T|LMP|No. I can tell it's tumbling; I guess the flat side not only is facing me, it's not only much brighter, it also grows larger.
026:30:34|C|Kerwin|Okay. Very interesting. We'll see if we can figure out where that's at relative to you. They keep updating the S-IV impact on us a little bit. The last guess we had was that it'll impact about the same longitude we gave you but close to zero latitude and a little bit later. You still won't be able to see it. And they're saying it might make a -
026:31:02|T|LMP|Roger.
026:31:03|C|Kerwin|- they're saying it might make a 100- to 120-foot crater, too.
026:31:13|T|LMP|It'll - it'll still be past the terminator for us for a while.
026:31:19|C|Kerwin|Right. It will be at about the rev 20 terminator, so it will be late in your lunar orbit activities before you'll be able to photograph it, and FAO is looking at whether we can work that in or not.
026:31:36|T|LMP|Okay.
026:43:26|T|CMP|Houston, 13.
026:43:29|C|Kerwin|13, Houston.
026:43:33|T|CMP|Hey, Joe? Is FAO ready to - or do you - or are you ready to give me those items that we made optional and deleted in the solo book?
026:43:44|C|Kerwin|Jack, we're not quite ready with that yet, but we will be before too long. Can you wait awhile?
026:43:53|T|CMP|Sure can. I got lots of time.
026:43:54|C|Kerwin|Okay.
027:20:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 27 hours, 20 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The crew, rather quiet during this period. Still in the Passive Thermal Control barbecue mode. Velocity now 4,991 feet per second [1,521 m/s]. Coming up, in slightly over 20 seconds, on the midpoint in distance, and at which time the spacecraft will be equally far from the Earth and from the Moon. The distance at this time will be 128,880.5 statute miles [207,413.1 km]. Coming up -  
027:20:50|P|PAO|Mark. That computes out to 112,070 nautical miles [207,554 km].
027:21:04|P|PAO|Continuing to leave the circuit live, as we anticipate further discussions. And later on today, the midcourse correction burn number 2 which will take Apollo 13 out of the free return trajectory into the so called hybrid trajectory, which would not necessarily return to the vicinity of the Earth. The closest approach would be something in the nature of 40,000 miles coming back from the non-free return trajectory. At 27 hours, 21 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and standing by; this is Apollo Control.
027:59:41|T|CDR|Hello, Houston; Apollo 13.
027:59:49|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
027:59:54|T|CDR|Just a passing comment, Joe. We're having lunch right now, and I just made myself a hotdog sandwich with ketchup. Very tasty and almost unheard of in the old days.
028:00:07|C|Kerwin|That's correct, 13. As I recall the Flight Plan, you're supposed to put mustard on the hot dogs and not ketchup, but I guess we'll overlook that.
028:00:18|T|CMP|We blew it.
028:00:20|C|Kerwin|Right. How's everything going?
028:00:28|T|CDR|Ah, Pretty good. We have about four different methods of spreading ketchup, right now.
028:00:34|C|Kerwin|Okay. Jack, we'll have your update to you before too long.
028:00:41|T|CMP|Okay. Fine, Joe. We did a fit check on the Hycon camera and everything works okay.
028:00:49|C|Kerwin|Okay. Beautiful. We don't have anything else for you at the moment.
028:46:44|T|LMP|Houston, 13.
028:46:49|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
028:46:56|T|LMP|Okay. We'd like to get the FM up now to look at some inside pictures there.
028:47:04|C|Kerwin|Okay. Stand by and I'll get a Go on this.
028:47:57|C|Kerwin|13, Houston.
028:48:01|T|LMP|Go ahead.
028:48:02|C|Kerwin|That's acceptable, Fred, and meanwhile, when you guys are ready to copy, we've got an MCC-2 PAD for you.
028:48:13|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by 1.
028:48:15|C|Kerwin|Roger that. And also if you can go to P00 and Accept conveniently, we'd like to uplink.
028:48:31|T|LMP|Okay. You've got it.
028:48:33|C|Kerwin|Okay.
028:49:06|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. You can go ahead with the P30 PAD.
028:49:11|C|Kerwin|Okay. Here we go. MCC-2, SPS/G&amp;N: 63634; plus 0.96, minus 0.23; 030:40:49.00; minus 0021.7, minus 0001.7, minus 0008.0; 080, 164, 326; N/A, N/A; 0023.2, 0:03.5 - We'll give you half a second on the burn time because it's so short - 0018.5; 44, 135.9, 28.1; and the rest is N/A. Comments: set stars 31 and 23; roll align 288, pitch 205, yaw 034; no ullage, LM weight 33499, and - Over.
028:51:02|T|LMP|Okay. MCC-2, SPS/G&amp;N: 63634; plus 0.96, minus 0.23; 030:40:49.00; minus 0021.7, minus 0001.7, minus 0008.0; 080, 164, 326; N/A, N/A; 0023.2, burn time 0:03.5, 0018.5; 44, 135.9, 28.1; and the rest N/A. Set stars 31, 23; roll align 288, pitch 205, yaw 034; no ullage, LM weight 33499.
028:52:11|C|Kerwin|Roger. Readback correct. I have two more short comments on them, but I want to wait just a second and make sure I understand them before I pass them to you.
028:52:25|T|LMP|Okay.
028:52:45|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred; Houston.
028:52:50|T|LMP|Go ahead.
028:52:51|C|Kerwin|The two additional comments were just that, first of all, they biased Delta-V<sub>C</sub> by minus 0.34 feet per second based on your EMS null bias checks. That's just for information. And the second one also for information is that your targeted pericynthion is 60 miles [111 km] after this correction.
028:53:25|T|LMP|Okay, understand. For Jack's information, the EMS Delta-V bias is 3.4, and our targeted pericynthion after this maneuver is 60 miles.
028:53:41|C|Kerwin|That's correct on the pericynthion. The EMS bias is 0.34, very small.
028:53:48|T|LMP|Okay. 0.34 on the EMS Delta-V bias.
028:53:53|C|Kerwin|Roger. And -
028:53:56|T|CMP|Hey, Joe, we'll give -
028:53:58|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, Jack -
028:53:59|T|CMP|We'll give you - we'll give you the read - we'll give you the results of another null bias test for comparative purposes right before the - oh, at the proper time.
028:54:08|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real fine; and the computer is yours.
028:54:12|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you. Going Block.
029:00:04|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; 13. Are you copying the torquing angles on the P52?
029:00:08|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. Give us a second.
029:00:26|C|Kerwin|And, 13, Houston. We have them. You can torque them.
029:00:30|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. Time of torqueing; 29 hours, 0 minute, 30 seconds.
029:00:36|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
029:23:39|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 29 hours, 23 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Ignition countdown clock toward the midcourse correction number 2, which will take Apollo 13 out of its free-return trajectory, now shows 1 hour, 16 minutes, 55 seconds until ignition. This burn, at a Ground Elapsed Time at 30 hours, 40 minutes, 49 seconds; will be Service Propulsion System burn, 23.2 feet per second retrograde. But will lower the spacecraft pericynthion or closest approach to the Moon to around 60 nautical miles. At 29 hours, 24 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control standing by for resumption of conversation between spacecraft communicator Vance Brand who has relieved Joe Kerwin here in Mission Control, and the crew of Apollo 13.
029:29:35|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
029:29:39|T|CMP|Go ahead, Joe.
029:29:40|C|Brand|Hey, you've got a new CapCom on now with the Black Crew, and we have about three items to give you, Jack.
029:29:50|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by 1. Are these updates or what?
029:29:56|C|Brand|I'm going to give you some High Gain Antenna angles for TV and the rest is just information, general words.
029:30:08|T|CDR|Go ahead there, Vance.
029:30:10|C|Brand|Okay. At burn attitude for TV, your pitch and yaw angles are as follows: Pitch, minus 1 - minus 69; yaw, 180; High Gain.
029:30:26|T|CMP|Okay.
029:30:27|C|Brand|Okay. Second point is that you're Go for MCC-2. Everything's looking good here.
029:30:34|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine.
029:30:36|C|Brand|And the last item's for Jack. Jack, preliminary indications are that you can get a 60-day extension on your - filing your income tax if you're out of the country.
029:30:54|T|CMP|That's good news. I guess I qualify.
029:31:00|C|Brand|Yeah, we were just looking at the map, and you're south of Florida so you're not in the country now.  But we wondered how about your car tags. Have you taken care of those?
029:31:20|T|CMP|Yeah, I did, as a matter of fact. I think I did.
029:31:28|T|LMP|Known as, 'plan ahead.'
029:31:30|C|Brand|Okay. Good.
029:31:52|C|Brand|And, Apollo 13, Houston. Recommend Omni Alpha until you get to the burn attitude.
029:32:00|T|CMP|Okay. Omni Alpha.
029:40:32|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; Apollo 13.
029:40:34|C|Brand|13, go ahead.
029:40:38|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. The EMS Delta-V pass passive, the results of the no-bias pass in 100 seconds, have been from 100 to 101.5.
029:40:52|C|Brand|Roger. Copy plus 100 to plus 101.5, and that agrees fairly closely with the last one, as I recall.
029:41:00|T|CMP|Okay. Fine.
029:45:46|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. We're at P40 burn attitude. Jim is on the sextant star check, and we do have a star in the sextant.
029:45:56|C|Brand|Roger, Jack. Copy. Very good.
029:46:02|T|CMP|But we couldn't tell you whether it's 44 or not.
029:46:08|C|Brand|Whoops.
029:46:44|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; 13. We're a little bit ahead of ourselves. Do we have a Go to do the fuel cell purge and the waste water dump?
029:46:57|C|Brand|Jack, that's affirm. You have a Go for those.
029:47:01|T|CMP|Okay. We're on our way.
029:50:14|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
029:50:18|T|CDR|Go ahead.
029:50:21|C|Brand|Jim, battery A is charged now. Whenever you want to unhook it will be fine with us.
029:50:28|T|CDR|Okay.
030:04:45|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control; 30 hours, 4 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Some 36 minutes away from ignition and midcourse correction burn number two. Apollo 13 presently 119,751 nautical miles [221,779 km] out from Earth. Velocity now 4,734 feet per second [1,443 m/s]. The scheduled television broadcast from Apollo 13 due in about 10 minutes. TV will last approximately 30 minutes and will include the activities prior to and during the midcourse correction burn number 2. 30 hours, 5 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, and standing by; this is Apollo Control.
030:12:04|T|CMP|Houston, 13. Are you still planning to have TV at the scheduled time?
030:12:16|C|Brand|Okay, 13; Houston. That's affirm. At the Flight Plan-scheduled time.
030:12:21|T|CMP|Okay. All right.  We've got a beautiful sight we want to show you.
030:12:36|C|Brand|Right.
030:12:47|C|Brand|13, Houston. You can go ahead with the TV now. We're standing by.
030:13:03|T|CMP|Okay. Here it comes.
030:13:04|C|Brand|Okay.
030:13:53|C|Brand|Okay. Jack. It's coming in, and it's right in the center of our screen.
030:14:00|T|CMP|Okay, Vance.
030:14:04|T|LMP|Can you - Think you could guess what that might be, Vance? Better than Charlie?
030:14:14|C|Brand|I don't want to start flipping coins at this point.
030:14:21|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. We're pointed just a little ways off from looking directly at the Moon. Jim is holding the camera through window 3. The Sun is coming at about 40 degrees off our left side, and what we are going to show you in just a minute is about 30 seconds of waste water dump and just show you just what it looks like. It's really fantastic.
030:14:49|C|Brand|Okay. We'd like to see that.
030:15:29|C|Brand|Okay. We saw some droplets speeding out for a little while, Jack. Now we don't see anything.
030:15:40|T|CDR|Actually, Vance, what you're looking at is solid water droplets coming out just about all the time. It lights up the whole sky around the Moon. It's just far too fine for you to see. Now I think they're coming out a little thicker.
030:15:53|C|Brand|Okay. Yeah, we see those.
030:16:01|T|CDR|Jack's complaining about seeing stars.
030:16:16|C|Brand|FIDO says he can understand why that would perturbate a trajectory now.
030:16:26|T|CDR|It's amazing watching these little frozen droplets maneuver. They seem to go in all directions, but finally after they get out a certain ways, settle down and they all seem to be traveling about the same direction.
030:16:42|C|Brand|Right. That's coming in real well.
030:16:51|T|CDR|The objects in the foreground are parts of the LM that you're looking at.
030:17:11|T|CDR|The camera is now going over to Fred.
030:17:18|C|Brand|We can just barely see those parts of the LM. They must be in a shadow.
030:17:34|T|CDR|Okay. Now you are looking at a thruster quad at the lower part of your screen.
030:17:41|T|LMP|I've got the f-stop all the way open now, Vance; that's quad  quad 1 you're looking at with the LM should - The Moon should be in view just over the top of the quad.
030:17:58|C|Brand|Right. We see the nozzle of the quad, but it's dark and it's not easy to see.
030:18:28|C|Brand|13, Houston. INCO suggests you try Average if you're in Peak to see if that gives us a better picture.
030:18:41|T|LMP|Okay. We're in Average now.
030:19:02|C|Brand|I think that helps out. We can see it better.
030:19:23|C|Brand|Okay. Now, 13, request you either move it away from the bright area or else move it back to Peak. Over.
030:20:08|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. I cranked the focus down a little bit. Is the quad coming in any better now?
030:20:17|C|Brand|It's coming in about the same, Fred, and you're a little weak now on the comm.
030:20:32|C|Brand|We could see when you went back to Peak.
030:20:38|T|LMP|And I'm now zoomed all the way out.
030:20:50|C|Brand|Okay. We could see you zoom in on the Moon, and it's near the center of our screen, just a little to the left. Very clear.
030:21:09|T|LMP|Yeah. I show it just about at 38.
030:21:16|C|Brand|We can't tell if it's gray or light brown, though.
030:21:33|T|LMP|Do you have your grid down there, Vance?
030:21:43|C|Brand|That's negative, Fred.
030:21:48|T|LMP|Okay.
030:22:31|T|LMP|I don't know if you can make out the features there, Vance, on the Moon, but it looks like the terminators are at central plains area somewhere around Descartes, maybe.
030:22:45|C|Brand|Okay. We're - We see it just as a bright portion of the lunar disk, and it looks a lot like you see it from Earth. Very bright. We're unable to see any features at all.
030:23:09|T|LMP|It's pretty much the same with the eyeballs in here, and it looks a little bigger now. But the only way I could see it very good at all was with the monocular, a little while ago.
030:23:31|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. Very good. We'd be interested to see in the cabin when you get ready for that, too.
030:23:39|T|LMP|Okay. I'll set up now.
030:23:59|T|CDR|And, Vance, we're counting down to midcourse-2, we're up to, in our checklist, to minus 6 minutes to go.
030:24:08|C|Brand|Roger. Minus 6 minutes. Understand you're about ready to turn on the gimbal motors and all that sort of thing. Okay. We see the computer now in the upper middle part of the - the panel. I think we see somebody's checklist in the center couch. It must be Jim holding the checklist.
030:24:39|T|LMP|Right. And what Jim's holding now, he's got a pen in his hand we've rigged on a string, as sort of a simple-minded accelerometer. This burn's pretty short and I'm not sure even that's going to show very much. But we'll see if it'll stretch out at the end of its string.
030:25:02|C|Brand|Yeah. We see the pencil at the top of the picture floating around. And Jack's coming into view now.
030:25:10|T|LMP|And I've gone back - Okay, I've gone back to Average now and how's the picture?
030:25:18|C|Brand|Roger.
030:28:08|T|LMP|Now in about a few minutes, Vance, I guess we'll see how about the only system we haven't used yet works. Everything else sure has worked mighty fine.
030:28:20|C|Brand|Right. The spacecraft's really working nicely. Okay. We're picking up panel 2 now. Still a little bit of the checklist.
030:28:57|T|LMP|Just wondering if you can pick up the caution array there?
030:29:00|C|Brand|Right. We just saw your - your testing of the caution and warning system at the left-hand side of the panel on our TV.  See the lights all flash on. You're doing it again.
030:29:54|C|Brand|You mission timer's showing up as a - a brilliant green in the upper left-hand part of the picture.
030:30:12|T|LMP|Roger. I got the camera kind of canted on you here, Vance.
030:30:19|T|CMP|Vance, Jim's going to go to VOX now.
030:30:22|T|CDR|Vance, how do you read?
030:30:23|C|Brand|Roger. Read you loud and clear, Jim.
030:30:28|T|CDR|Okay. We'll - what we'll do - We'll be on VOX for the remainder of the burn and preburn countdown.
030:30:38|T|CDR|... VOX.
030:30:40|T|CDR|... And what we're waiting for is 54 minutes on our counter or 20 which would be minus -
030:30:58|C|Brand|Jim, we hear clipping on your VOX. Could you adjust it so that you're coming in continuously all the time?
030:31:08|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by 1.
030:31:17|T|CDR|l, 2, 3, 4, 5. How's that, Vance?
030:31:21|C|Brand|Okay. That's better.
030:32:04|T|CMP|Vance, how do you read the CMP on VOX?
030:32:07|C|Brand|Jack, read you loud and clear.
030:32:10|T|CMP|Okay. Fine.
030:32:21|T|CMP|We show minus 8&frac12; minutes.
030:32:25|C|Brand|Roger. Houston copies.
030:32:44|T|CDR|Close -
030:33:00|T|LMP|Is that too close, Vance, or can you make out the SPS engine panel now?
030:33:06|C|Brand|We - we can see your fuel and oxidizer gauges and hydrogen/oxygen gauges at the top of the picture and the PUGS, but it isn't coming in in focus too well. It's a little dim.
030:33:20|T|LMP|Yes. I think the problem is I'm about 2 feet and it doesn't go down but to 4.
030:33:32|C|Brand|Right. We understand that's the panel right in front of your face.
030:33:43|T|CDR|Okay. Vance, stand by for the main gimbal motors.
030:33:49|T|CMP|Okay. We're minus 7 minutes.
030:33:53|C|Brand|Roger.
030:34:25|C|Brand|Fred, the focus is good enough that we can see the position of your four ball valves at the top of the picture for the big SPS engine.
030:34:37|T|CDR|What would you like to watch, Vance?
030:34:43|T|LMP|Hopefully, you'll see the - or we'll see the two on the left here, set A, go on here directly -
030:34:51|T|CMP|Minus 6 minutes.
030:34:52|T|CDR|Main Bus Ties, two, On, Fred. Okay. SPS Helium Valve, two, Auto and checked Auto barber pole. TVC Servo Power is 1, AC1/Main A; 2, AC2/Main B.

030:35:27|T|CMP|RHC armed.
030:35:29|T|CDR|Okay. Let's do a primary TVC check.
030:35:34|T|CMP|Fred, are you ready to start primary?
030:35:36|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead on primaries.
030:35:38|T|CMP|Okay. Pitch 1, Start.
030:35:40|T|LMP|Good.

030:37:38|T|CMP|Okay. We're coming up on 3 minutes. I'll give you a Mark.
030:37:41|T|CDR|Fair enough.
030:37:50|T|CMP|Mark.
030:37:51|T|CMP|Three minutes. DET is good.
030:37:53|T|CDR|Okay. We're set.
030:37:58|T|CDR|At 58, we want Delta-V Thrust A to Normal.
030:38:05|C|Brand|Jim, Houston. You're looking good down here. Go for the burn.
030:38:10|T|CDR|Right, Vance.
030:38:50|T|CMP|Okay. Two minutes. Delta-V thrust -
030:38:52|T|CDR|Delta-V Thrust A to Normal.
030:38:53|T|CMP|Normal.
030:38:55|T|CDR|Translation Hand Controller armed. Arm your Rotational Hand Controller. I've got mine armed. Okay, Fred. Tape Recorder, High Bit Rate, Record, Forward, Command Reset. Standing by for 59. It's running?.
030:39:51|T|CMP|Minus 1 minute.
030:39:52|T|CMP|Okay null that.
030:40:17|T|CMP|Average G.
030:40:19|T|CDR|EMS mode to Normal.
030:40:21|T|CMP|Mode Normal.
030:40:22|T|CDR|Standing by for Enter Enable.
030:40:46|T|CDR|Enter Enable.
030:40:51|T|LMP|Two balls.
030:40:56|T|CMP|Okay. Shutdown.
030:40:57|T|CDR|Main engine ...
030:40:58|T|CMP|Okay. Let's get the residuals. Okay, Houston, there are the residuals.
030:41:10|T|CDR|Okay; gimbal motors.
030:41:12|T|Brand|Okay. Copy residuals.
030:41:13|T|CMP|... secondaries.
030:41:15|T|LMP|Okay. Go.
030:41:16|T|CMP|Okay. Yaw 2.
030:41:18|T|LMP|Good.
030:41:19|T|CMP|Pitch 2.
030:41:20|T|LMP|That's good.
030:41:23|T|CMP|Primary.
030:41:24|T|LMP|On Low Bit Rate. Start. Go with the primaries.
030:41:30|T|CMP|Okay. Yaw 1.
030:41:31|T|LMP|That's good.
030:41:32|T|CMP|Pitch 1.
030:41:33|T|LMP|Okay.
030:41:34|T|CMP|TVC Servo Power, Off.
030:41:35|T|LMP|- is Off. Okay. Record the Delta-V<sub>C</sub>. You got that?
030:41:38|T|CMP|Okay. You got the - You got the Delta-V<sub>C</sub> in minus 3.7.
030:41:41|T|CMP|Okay. Function, Off. Mode, standby.
030:41:43|T|CDR|Proceeding now.
030:41:44|T|CMP|Off. Mode, Standby  -
030:41:45|T|LMP|Translation Hand Control Power, Off.
030:41:47|T|CMP|Okay. Power Off.
030:41:48|T|LMP|ROT Power Direct, two, Off.
030:41:49|T|CMP|Two Off.
030:41:50|T|LMP|Rate 2.
030:41:52|T|CMP|BMAGs, Rate 2.
030:41:53|T|LMP|I'm already in low bit rate.
030:41:54|T|LMP|Okay.
030:41:56|T|CDR|Yes, we were on those ... so that we had less than 0.2.
030:42:02|C|Brand|Okay. Houston copied your residuals, very low.
030:42:13|T|LMP|Okay. Fuel is 1.0; oxidizer 0.25; the Ox unbalance is reading 200 decrease, which doesn't mean very much, and I guess that wasn't too much for a push there, Vance. I didn't see the accelerometer do a whole lot and it was a little surprising how slowly the injector valves opened, at least on the indicators.
030:42:44|C|Brand|Roger. That was a very short burn. Request you give us a sweep across the panel when you get a chance, Fred. Let us see Jack and Jim again. Over.
030:42:56|T|LMP|Okay.
030:42:57|T|CMP|Okay, Vance, I was going to show you on - wonder if the folks might - down there might be interested in how we find out how far we're away from the Moon. Going to do that right now in program 21 here.
030:43:09|C|Brand|Okay.
030:43:11|T|CMP|I'm asking the computer how far away we are. And the computer is telling me we're 121,490 miles out.
030:43:21|C|Brand|Okay. That agrees fairly closely with our map on the wall.
030:43:30|T|CMP|I'm glad. That means you're tracking us too.
030:43:38|T|CDR|And if you didn't see our residuals, it was 0.1 X, 0.2 on Y, and 0.1 Z, and Delta-V<sub>C</sub> was minus 3.8.
030:44:01|C|Brand|Jack, Houston. We show you down here 121 thousand miles 520 out. So I guess we all agree.
030:44:12|T|CMP|Okay. Real good, Vance. What I'm going to do is give you a shot of Fred.
030:44:23|T|LMP|If we can get all the wiring out of the way.
030:44:27|T|CMP|The big problem here is, when you move the TV around, this wire follows you like a snake here.
030:44:35|C|Brand|Yeah, we have Fred now. Looks like he has a lariat there, getting ready to rope the checklist.
030:44:47|T|LMP|That's only half of it. We have most of it hidden away.  It's been pretty interesting doing all the camera work here to get a little extra training running the TV here, hopefully for when we get on the ground at Fra Mauro. The monitor does make it pretty easy though.
030:45:12|C|Brand|Right. That's a real advantage in the cockpit. You're just a little bit dark. It looks like it might help to have the f-stop run down about one increment. See how it comes out -
030:45:26|T|LMP|Can't do it, we're wide open.
030:45:27|C|Brand|Are you?
030:45:29|T|CDR|I think we're wide open -
030:45:30|T|CMP|Yeah. We're wide open, Vance.
030:45:42|T|CMP|Okay. Does that help any, Vance?
030:45:45|C|Brand|Okay. It's reasonably good. We can make out Fred fairly well. Looks like he's in a shadow. Hey, that helps. You just turned up the lights, huh?
030:45:55|T|CMP|Yes. We went fixed on the -
030:45:59|C|Brand|Okay. You're on candid camera.
030:46:05|T|CDR|We did notice one thing, Vance. You know that new fad with long hair? It won't work too well up here in space.
030:46:15|C|Brand|What was that one again?
030:46:18|T|CDR|I say, you know the new - the new fad with long hair?
030:46:21|C|Brand|Right.
030:46:22|T|CDR|It doesn't work too well up in space, you can't comb your hair up here.
030:46:27|C|Brand|Well, I guess you have to give up something.
030:46:36|C|Brand|Well, at least it - it helps to try. We can see you trying to comb your hair there, Jim. It looks like your - your beards haven't come along to the point where you've had to use the razor though.
030:46:51|T|CDR|Well, we've been debating that. We thought we'd take care of our beards tomorrow and make that one of our daily routines.
030:47:06|T|LMP|I take it that was a subtle hint, Vance.
030:47:11|C|Brand|No, no. We're not commenting on your appearance, Fred. I mean nothing derogatory, understand.
030:47:20|T|CDR|And, Vance, I thought we'd get a picture of Jack just so that all the girls know that he's still here. [Laughter.] Say hello to them.
030:47:30|T|CMP|[Laughter.]
030:47:34|C|Brand|Yeah, we - we appreciate that. There he is. Big Jack.
030:47:57|C|Brand|Jack, you're in the shadow right now; we have a little bit of interference from your window, which is very bright, so we can't - I think you're smiling, but it's a little hard to tell.
030:48:11|T|CDR|Think I'm smiling.
030:48:12|C|Brand|Hey, there we go.  Incidentally, we've been getting all kinds of bits of information to pass up to you. We've had baseball scores coming in, basketball. Somebody said there's 220 days, shopping days left 'til Christmas.
030:48:46|T|CMP|Yeah, who won the Masters, Vance?
030:48:56|C|Brand|It was a tie in the Masters and stand by.  It was a tie between Littler and Casper after 72 holes, and there's going to be a playoff Monday, we understand.
030:49:16|T|CMP|Oh. Sounds good.
030:49:35|C|Brand|One thing the world might be interested in knowing is what you do after the burn in the way of configuring switches back. We - We heard you go through the checklist. But, I guess right now, basically, you probably have all the switches back in position and you're in a mode to continue on with - Okay. What does the Flight Plan say? You're going to be doing cislunar navigation. So, Jack you're going to be down in the LEB. Is that correct?
030:50:12|T|CMP|That's right, Vance. Be going down there shortly.
030:50:30|C|Brand|Okay. The TV now is all but black. Looks like it must be pointing into a shadow.
030:50:39|T|CMP|What he's doing there, he's trying to give you one more shot of the Moon, and right now I'm setting up to maneuver to the optics calibration attitude.
030:50:47|C|Brand|Roger.
030:50:55|T|LMP|And what I wanted to point out, I don't know if it's apparent, but to show the advantage of doing all the dumps just before the burn, we're looking again at the same scene over quad 1 at the Moon. And now you don't see all the sparkly frozen particles outside there anymore. We've sort of run off and left them.
030:51:22|C|Brand|Rog. We - We don't see anything out there anymore in the way of particles leaving the spacecraft. We'd suggest, maybe you zoom the Moon in a little bit again so we can see the shape of it better.
030:51:59|C|Brand|Okay. That brings the Moon in. We can see the terminator at the top of the melon-shaped disk.
030:52:11|T|LMP|Okay. Now you can see a few of the spark - sparkling particles going across the screen. Those are being emitted from the thrusters. Jack's maneuvering the spacecraft now.
030:52:34|C|Brand|Okay. We can see those very poorly. Well, actually, they're coming in better now. It looks like little specks going from the upper left part of the screen across to the right, and understand those are from the thrusters.
030:52:52|T|LMP|That's affirm.
030:54:12|C|Brand|Okay, 13; Houston. Just as an item of interest, advise your speed with respect to the Earth now is 4,667 feet per second [1,423 m/s].
030:54:29|T|CMP|Okay. Thanks, Vance.
030:55:01|C|Brand|Okay, Apollo 13; Houston. The Moon has been in and out of the - the - our screen here. Right now it's off at the bottom side, but we can still see the particles coming off from the spacecraft.
030:55:20|T|LMP|Okay. I'll have to pull it out the window now, Vance. The Sun's coming up on the right side.
030:55:26|C|Brand|Roger. Understand. You -
030:55:27|T|CDR|Do you want to see any shots down in the LEB, Vance?
030:55:31|C|Brand|Say again.
030:55:35|T|CDR|Do you want to see any of the photographs or do you want the TV down in the LEB?
030:55:40|C|Brand|That's right, Jim. It'd be good to see what you're doing down in the LEB or the far corner of the spacecraft where the optics are. Might be interesting to describe what you will do in the next few minutes in the way of sightings.
030:55:59|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. First we're going to give you a shot of the sleep station.
030:56:22|C|Brand|Okay. The camera's bounced around a little, but we can see the green computer come in every once in a while.
030:56:59|T|CDR|While Jack's getting the sleep station rolled up, I thought I'd show you one interesting corner. We've got a temporary stowage bag here and that's where all our wastepaper and all that goes while we're - after every meal. It's in the right-hand corner down by our dump system.
030:57:16|C|Brand|Roger. Understand. We're looking at the wastebasket.
030:57:26|T|CDR|And the age-old question that's always asked us is how do we get rid of liquid waste and that line that you see, I think you can see it now, it goes right outside where we open up the overboard drain dump, and all of our waste products, liquid waste products, go out through that line and get dumped overboard.
030:57:45|C|Brand|Roger. Understand, and we can see somebody's foot, as well.
030:57:51|T|CDR|Okay. Fred's now going down there, and he is going to try to get underneath the sleep station on his side where we have a sleep restraint. And the whole object of that is to - merely to position the body between the - between the bottom of the spacecraft and - so it doesn't float up between that and the bottom of the couch.
030:58:14|C|Brand|Roger. The sleep restraint of the hammock is coming into view underneath the couch. It's the white object.
030:58:27|T|CDR|You perhaps can see the zipper of the hammock right now. It's the black lines in that white object.
030:58:34|C|Brand|Right. We can see it.
030:58:39|T|CDR|Vance, these hammocks, by the way, are very comfortable. When we first heard about them in the design of Apollo, we thought they weren't necessary, but they turned out to be very nice devices to sleep in.
030:59:15|T|CDR|I'm trying now to get down there with Fred to show you how it works. I keep floating up, though, but maybe we can get a little shot here.
030:59:42|C|Brand|Okay. We have somebody upside down in the photograph there now.  Realizing, of course, in - in space there is no really right-side up or upside down. It still looks that way to us.
031:00:10|T|CDR|Okay. That's - That's Fred now. I'm trying to put him right-side up, for you folks back there in the sleep station. Fred, would you move your hands there so the folks back home can see you?
031:00:23|C|Brand|Okay. That's coming in real clear, Jim. We see Fred in the sleep restaint - restraint.
031:00:36|T|CDR|As a matter of fact, Vance, I find my - I find Fred down there all the time.
031:00:44|C|Brand|Yeah. I can see he appreciates that.  Looks fairly comfortable.
031:01:08|C|Brand|Looks like there's a lot of room down there, considering all the boxes on the floor underneath the couch.
031:01:16|T|CDR|It's surprising. There still is quite a bit of room down there even with the Hycon camera box down. And right now, I'm going to bring the camera back up.
031:01:55|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. If there is no more that you would like to see right now, we'll terminate our little TV for you today.
031:02:01|C|Brand|Okay. Thank you very much, Jim. Appreciated seeing inside the spacecraft and getting a look at the Moon that you're rapidly approaching.
031:02:13|T|CDR|Roger. This is Odyssey saying goodbye.
031:03:54|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 31 hours, 4 minutes. We've completed the change of shift here in Mission Control. Flight Director Milton Windler has replaced Flight Director Glynn Lunney. Our Capsule Communicator will continue to be astronaut Vance Brand. The change of shift press conference is scheduled to begin shortly in the MSC News Center Auditorium, and participants will be Glynn Lunney, Flight Director; and Astronaut Tony England.
031:05:36|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
031:05:41|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
031:05:44|C|Brand|Okay. At your convenience we have an item to give you which will have to be copied. It's information on how to photograph Comet Bennett at time 32 hours GET. Over.
031:06:02|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by 1 minute.
031:06:03|C|Brand|Okay.
031:07:02|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. Go ahead.
031:07:06|C|Brand|Okay. Time 32 hours, 00 minutes GET. Instructions at completion of P23, maneuver to following attitude: roll, 101.0; pitch, 090.0; yaw, 000.0. High Gain Antenna angles will be: pitch, minus 23; yaw, 93. Use normal PTC procedures to dampen rates. After vehicle's stable, and before spin-up, take photographs of Comet Bennett. Use the DAC on the sextant with magazine G. That is, very high-speed black-and-white film, right? That's the dim-light film. Take three photos, one each at 5-, 20-, and 60-seconds time exposure. Use Auto optics. Noun 88 values are: R1, plus 34717; R2, minus 08028; R3, plus 35075. Take three photos, one each at 5-, 20-, and 60-second time exposure using manual optics. Shaft will be 000.8 degrees, trunnion 12.5 degrees. Comment: Strip off about 50 frames; that is, 2 seconds of - at 24 feet per second before the first frame and after the last frame of the photos. That is, 2 second - 2 seconds at 24 frames per second - before the first frame and after the last frame of photos.
031:11:13|T|LMP|Is that it, Vance?
031:11:15|C|Brand|And that's all.
031:11:19|T|LMP|Okay. The time is - The event will be at 32:00; and we're to maneuver to the following attitude; roll, 101.0; pitch, 090.0; yaw, all zips. High Gain angles will be pitch, minus 23; yaw, 93. And we're to use normal PTC procedures to damp the rates. And after damping the rates and before spin-up, we're to put the DAC on the sextant with the magazine G, very high-speed black and white film. Then, we're to take three photos, one each at 5-, 20-, and 60-seconds' time exposure using audio - Auto optics. Our Noun 88 values: R1, plus 34717; R2, minus 08028; R3, plus 35075. Thence, three more photos, one each at 5-, 20-, 60-seconds time exposure using manual optics. Shaft, 0.8 degrees; trunnion, 12.5 degrees. And we're to take 2-second bursts at 24 frames per second, before and after these pictures.
031:12:49|C|Brand|Your readback is correct, Fred.
031:13:23|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 31 hours, 13 minutes. We understand the change of shift press conference is ready to begin in the MSC News Center Auditorium. During the press conference we'll be recording any conversations with the crew for play back immediately following the change of shift briefing. We might also add at this point that during the television transmission, which lasted a total of 50 minutes, 41 seconds, among the viewers in the viewing room here in Mission Control were Astronaut Fred Haise wife, Mary, and his three children; Mary, Frederick, and Stephen. At 31 hours, 14 minutes; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
031:20:14|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
031:20:18|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
031:20:21|C|Brand|Jim, for PTC tonight, request that you disable quads C and D. That's the opposite of last night. Over.
031:20:36|T|CDR|Okay. For PTC tonight, disable quads C and D.
031:20:40|C|Brand|Rog. And advise in approximately an hour, we'll have some read-ups whenever you're ready to take them regarding solo book changes.
031:20:53|T|CDR|Okay. We'll be standing by for it.
031:20:56|C|Brand|Rog.
031:30:52|T|LMP|Houston, 13.
031:30:54|C|Brand|Go ahead, 13.
031:31:00|T|LMP|Have you all got a chance to look at the data on the SPS yet?
031:31:06|C|Brand|Stand by 1, Fred.
031:31:40|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
031:31:44|T|LMP|Go ahead.
031:31:47|C|Brand|Fred, it looks good, but they haven't had a chance to evaluate everything. They'll probably be finished with looking at strip charts in about 15 minutes, and after that we'll try to get back with you.
031:32:01|T|LMP|Okay. Thank you.
031:32:03|C|Brand|Rog.
031:34:22|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 31 hours, 34 minutes. During the change of shift briefing, Flight Director Milton Windler has been in the process of reviewing the mission status with each of his flight controllers. We've also had some conversations with the spacecraft. Vance Brand has given the crew the instructions for photographing the Comet Bennett at 32 hours. This will be done using the Data Acquisition Camera, a 16-millimeter data camera on board the spacecraft. And, at this time, Jack Swigert is in the Lower Equipment Bay doing a P23 exercise, the midcourse navigation, using the onboard optical equipment and the onboard computer and guidance system, updating the guidance system with onboard sightings of five stars. We'll play back the tape recorded conversations that we have and then standby for live communications.
031:36:44|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
031:36:48|T|LMP|Go ahead.
031:36:50|C|Brand|On the P33, just like to verify that you changed the Noun 88 values for this last star. It looks like they haven't been changed. Over.
031:37:06|T|CMP|Okay, Vance.
031:37:10|T|CMP|That's better. Let's read you what we - what we have. We have what they had in the Flight Plan, and if it's been changed from the Flight Plan, we don't have it.
031:37:29|C|Brand|Stand by 1.
031:38:09|T|CDR|We think you're right, Vance. It looks like they used the same set of Noun 88 for both stars by mistake.
031:38:16|C|Brand|Okay, very good.
031:44:04|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. That ought to complete the P23s, right?
031:44:07|C|Brand|Okay. Very good, Jack.
031:44:37|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
031:44:42|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.
031:44:44|C|Brand|We have some results on your - your first star, if you'd like to hear them. The rest of the stars we'll - we'll have to give you in a couple of hours. Over.
031:44:58|T|CMP|Go ahead.
031:44:59|C|Brand|Okay, the first star: the corrected altitude, 15 kilometers plus or minus 4; effective altitude, 12 kilometers plus or minus 7. As far as the substellar point, the value is arc-minutes - 2 arc-minutes, and that's very good. And, like I said, we'll get back with you in a couple of hours for the rest.
031:56:31|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
031:56:36|T|CMP|Go ahead.
031:56:37|T|CDR|Go ahead.
031:56:38|C|Brand|Okay. We have several items, here. First, is a reminder on the PTC that R1 should be 375 - 0.375 degrees as last night, to get 0.3-degree rotation rate. The second one -
031:57:00|T|CMP|Okay. Copy that.
031:57:02|C|Brand|Okay. The second one, at 32 hours looking at Bennett's Comet - we want the pictures taken when the spacecraft is as stable as it's going to be before starting PTC. The stability requirement is very high. We weren't sure if you understood that from what we passed up. In addition, the photographs might not show as much as the eye can see of the comet, so if you see anything interesting about the structure of the comet, why, sketching it is in order and is encouraged. Over.
031:57:50|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. What we'll do is, when we get to attitude, we'll disable the quads and do like we did last night; we'll let GUIDO and you people down there tell us when you think we are stable enough; then we'll do all this work with the DAC on the sextant, first; and then when we get that done, we'll go back and put the sextant eyepiece back on and see what we can observe visually.
031:58:18|C|Brand|Okay. That sounds good. Also, while you are waiting for the vehicle to stabilize, it might be interesting to have the eyepiece on and be looking at it visually. Okay. Next item: your SPS burn had no anomalies whatsoever. It was a very good burn.
031:58:52|T|LMP|Okay. Very good.
031:58:55|C|Brand|Next item: request hydrogen tank 1 Heater, Off, for balancing purposes.
031:59:22|C|Brand|And Apollo 13, another item: something that we have observed and you might be seeing is a slight T<sub>CE</sub> fluctuation on fuel cell 3. This fluctuation has been going from about 152 to 160 over a 37-second period. It has been seen on other flights in the past. No one is worried about it, but the usual fluctuation is about 1&frac12; degrees instead of 7 seconds, so I thought you should be aware of it.
032:00:07|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. And one other slight distinction we've noted is the flow of hydrogen versus the oxygen is not exactly matched on fuel cell 3 either.
032:00:26|C|Brand|Okay. We copy. And the last item: we'd like to send you an IRIG update, so at your convenience, request P00 and Accept.
032:00:46|T|CDR|Okay. We are in P00 and Accept, Vance.
032:00:49|C|Brand|Okay.
032:01:20|T|CDR|Quad C and D are disabled, Vance.
032:01:24|C|Brand|Roger. Disabled. And down here, we see that your hydrogen and oxygen on the fuel cell are exactly matched, so we suspect it's purely a spacecraft read-out problem.
032:01:40|T|CMP|Okay.
032:02:46|P|PAO|At this time, the crew is in the process of stabilizing the spacecraft attitude, eliminating all rotational rates in preparation for spinning up the spacecraft for the Passive Thermal Control mode. Before beginning the slow rotation of Passive Thermal Control, Jack Swigert will attach the Data Acquisition Camera to the spacecraft's sextant, the 28-power sextant, and will attempt to get some photographs of Bennett's comet. He'll take a series of photographs at varying time exposure rates and he's also been advised if any particularly interesting features are noted visually of the Comet Bennett, that they should attempt to sketch them. At present time, Apollo 13 is 125,083 nautical miles [231,654 km] from Earth. The spacecraft velocity is 4,571 feet per second [1,393 m/s]. The fuel cell temperature fluctuations which were mentioned are occurring in fuel cell No. 3, and this is a temperature that's measured at the condenser exhaust, at the point where the hydrogen reactant is flowing out of the fuel cell and the water's being separated from it. The other two fuel cells are remaining steady at about a 157 -
032:04:26|T|CMP|Okay, Vance, let us know when you're through with the DSKY so we can load Noun 88?
032:04:40|C|Brand|Roger. We'll let you know, Jack.
032:04:51|P|PAO|And as we were saying, the two other fuel cells, Fuel Cells 1 and 2, are remaining stable at a temperature of about 157 to 159 degrees. Fuel Cell 3 is fluctuating between about 152 and 160. Vance Brand advised the crew that this will cause no problem, with a possible exception that it could trigger a warning alarm to them. But we have seen this sort of thing on previous flights, and it should cause no problem.
032:05:22|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston. The computer's yours, again.
032:06:10|P|PAO|The Guidance Officer has just reported that the spacecraft appears to be approaching a stable attitude, and we expect that would be in a position shortly for the crew to begin - attempt to photograph the Bennet Comet.
032:10:56|C|Brand|Okay. You're GO for the pictures.
032:11:01|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. We tried our Auto Optics and couldn't pick it up there. We're pointing pretty much right into the Sun, and things are pretty well washed out. And I've gone to Manual Optics and I'm trying to get 0.8, 12.5 on the shaft and trunnion, and I still can't pick it up. So - it's very light in the sextant, so I kind of think maybe we're too near the Sun to see it.
032:11:28|T|CDR|That's right, Vance. The sextant is all - it's - it's all milky and it - any comet that could be seen through there is just going to be missed in the background.
032:11:41|C|Brand|Okay, we copy that. We got some discussion. Stand by.
032:13:35|T|CMP|Okay, Vance, it isn't - we're not looking into the Sun - what we are getting is a large reflection from the Sun behind us off the LM; and it is - it is coming on that quad 1 there, and that quad is reflecting back into the sextant.
032:13:54|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. Understand. Just a question: if you look through the telescope, can you see the comet at all? Over.
032:14:07|T|CMP|No, I can't, Vance. It's - it's still too light.
032:14:23|T|SC|Does that
032:14:35|C|Brand|Stand by.
032:15:19|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. You heard Jack Swigert advise, and Jim Lovell confirm, that reflections of the Sun off the LM are apparently washing out the sextant of the Bennett - the Comet Bennett. This problem is being discussed in Mission Control right now. Ken Mattingly, who is in the Control Center, and the Flight Activities Officier, and Capcom Vance Brand, as well as astronaut Tony England, are huddled around the Flight Director's console, discussing the possibility of perhaps seeking another spacecraft attitude that might avoid the reflection problem.
032:17:45|T|LMP|Say, Vance?
032:17:50|C|Brand|Roger. Go ahead.
032:17:55|T|LMP|Are the flowers blooming yet?
032:18:00|C|Brand|Gee, I sure haven't seen any.
032:18:04|T|LMP|Okay.
032:18:05|C|Brand|Hey, we've - we've got quite a discussion down here on your trying to observe the comet, and this reflection is not unexpected. And give us another minute, and we'll be back with you on something on that.
032:18:25|T|CDR|Okay. I doubt very seriously though, if we take any photographs with high-speed black and white with the light coming into the sextant that you're going to get anything out of it.
032:18:42|C|Brand|Okay. Unanimous opinion is that you're right, and we'll scratch all of this Bennett Comet stuff on the way out, with the hope that conditions will be more favorable after TEI. Over.
032:19:04|T|CDR|Sounds good. Without the LM, we may have a better chance.
032:19:10|C|Brand|Roger.
032:19:29|C|Brand|And Apollo 13, you're Go for PTC. Your rates are very low according to what we can read.
032:19:38|T|CDR|Roger, Vance.
032:22:24|T|LMP|Okay. Are you going to give a call on Omni B, Vance?
032:22:42|T|LMP|Do you read, Vance?
032:22:43|C|Brand|Roger. Go ahead. Request Omni B, Fred, and secure the High Gain Antenna.
032:22:53|T|LMP|Okay. You got it.
032:22:55|C|Brand|Okay.
032:43:21|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
032:43:25|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
032:43:27|C|Brand|Just something to think about. In about 30 minutes, we can generate the PADs that we have yet to send up before the sleep period, so we could support an earlier sleep period if you so desired. And - but, it will take us 30 minutes to get that stuff. The other thing is any time you're ready to copy, I can read up the solo book changes. Over - And, also, two pages in the Flight Plan.
032:44:01|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. We're about ready to copy the solo book changes and the Flight Plan changes, and whenever your PADs are ready, we'll take those. And as far as moving up the sleep period, that's fine, but we'll - if we don't go to sleep right away, we'll use it to get out some of our lunar maps and study them.
032:44:21|C|Brand|Okay. And we'll get busy getting those PADs for you as soon as possible then, and I'll stand by on the copying bit.
032:45:44|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 32 hours, 46 minutes. The crew sleep period is scheduled to begin at 37 hours. You heard Vance Brand advise Jim Lovell that should the crew desire, we would be in a position to give them the PAD information that they need to get before beginning the sleep period a bit early and give the astronauts themselves the option of beginning their rest period earlier if they desire. The primary activities remaining on the Flight Plan, in addition to passing up those, the numerical data, is for the crew to change out one of the lithium hydroxide canisters and complete the pre-sleep checklist and their evening meal. And when those things have been completed they would be able to begin the rest period. We don't have any idea at this time precisely when the rest period would begin. That would be up to the crew. At the present time Apollo 13 is 126,900 nautical miles [235,000 km] from Earth. The velocity is 4,500 feet per second [1,370 m/s].
032:47:28|T|CMP|Okay, Vance, I'm ready to copy the solo book changes there.
032:47:37|C|Brand|Okay. First, turn to page 12. On the right-hand side of the page, starting from the middle of the page down, everything under &quot;Cycle 5 frames, Replace dark side or dark slide&quot; should be deleted until you get to the very bottom of the page where you have &quot;Acquisition MSFN Omni D&quot; and that should remain in. Also, leave in &quot;Remove window shades,&quot; which is about the third line down from where you start.
032:48:37|T|CMP|Okay. Okay. Then from &quot;Cycle 5 frames, Replace dark slide,&quot; from there on down, delete.
032:48:50|C|Brand|That's everything from there on down, with the exception of &quot;Remove window shades&quot; and at the bottom &quot;Acquisition MSFN Omni D.&quot;
032:49:10|T|CMP|Okay. Copy.
032:49:12|C|Brand|And that includes in the margin to the left, the &quot;DAP load&quot; that's at the very start there and the &quot;0.0507&quot; and &quot;plus 0500, &quot; farther down.
032:49:31|T|CMP|Okay. Got it.
032:49:34|C|Brand|Okay. Going to page 13.
032:49:39|T|CMP|Okay.
032:49:42|C|Brand|Okay, in the left margin, just below 105 hours GET, cross out the &quot;0507&quot; and the &quot;plus 0500,&quot; and below that, add in &quot;DAP load&quot; as follows: &quot;10111 and 11111.
032:50:11|T|CMP|Okay. Got it.
032:50:13|C|Brand|Okay. Now, next, at about 105:05, there's a &quot;Verb 48.&quot; That should be moved up to 105, and below that, the &quot;Verb 49 maneuver&quot; should be moved up, too.
032:50:42|T|CMP|Okay. That &quot;Verb 48&quot; should be moved up to 105:05 and also the &quot;Verb 49.
032:50:50|C|Brand|That should be moved up to 105:00. I'm sorry. Both.
032:50:56|T|CMP|Okay.
032:50:57|C|Brand|And what that does is give you more time to maneuver.
032:51:07|C|Brand|Okay. Next.
032:51:09|T|CMP|All right.
032:51:10|C|Brand|Page 14, right-hand side, near the bottom under &quot;Orbital Science,&quot; scratch out &quot;Verify DSE ON,&quot; and also delete &quot;Visual target 3 on track 180 plus 19,&quot; and cross out the penned-in &quot;D5.
032:51:43|T|CMP|Okay. Got it.
032:51:46|C|Brand|Next, page 15, left-hand column, or left-hand side, rather, near the bottom, where it says &quot;Configure cameras and tape&quot; and goes down through &quot;Replace dark slide.&quot; Just make the comment there, &quot;Solar corona is optional.&quot; Over.
032:52:16|T|CMP|Okay. Got it.
032:52:19|C|Brand|Okay, next page, 16. This is a continuation of the same solar-corona thing. On the right-hand side of the page, starting just above 107:40 with &quot;Verb 49, maneuver to solar-corona attitude,&quot; from there on down to 107:55 just beneath &quot;Replace dark slide,&quot; all of this is in an optional category. So you just might line off -
032:53:03|T|CMP|All right. Got it.
032:53:04|C|Brand|- that and put &quot;Optional, solar corona.&quot; Okay, next, page 17 -
032:53:12|T|CMP|Okay.
032:53:13|C|Brand|- starting at 108:00 on the left-hand side, line out &quot;Stop Orb rate at Orb science attitude.&quot; At - Line out in the left-hand column the DAP load of &quot;10101&quot; and &quot;11111.&quot; Going down to 108:10, add in the following: &quot;Stop ORB rate at track attitude,&quot; and, in parentheses, &quot;0, 353, 0.&quot; In the left-hand -
032:54:14|T|CMP|Okay.
032:54:15|C|Brand|Okay, in the left-hand column under 108:10, put in a DAP load in parentheses of &quot;10101&quot; and, under that, &quot;11111.
032:54:33|T|CMP|Okay.
032:54:35|C|Brand|Beneath that, scratch out &quot;Spacecraft control dash CMC Auto verify.&quot; Scratch out the &quot;Verb 79&quot; and all in parentheses after that, like the &quot;Minus 00507,&quot; et cetera. And beneath that, scratch out &quot;Pro to start pitch rate.&quot; In parentheses, &quot;0, 230 slash 018, 0.
032:55:10|T|CMP|Okay.
032:55:12|C|Brand|Okay. Looking to the right, the LM attitude or rather the CSM attitude will be incorrect, so you can cross that off. And beneath the picture of the Moon, cross out the - in parentheses, &quot;108.19&quot; and the &quot;0,230/018, 0
032:55:39|T|CMP|All right.
032:55:41|C|Brand|On the right-hand half of the page, cross out the &quot;Orbital science block,&quot; and under that &quot;Visual target 1 south of track TR.&quot; And under that, the penned-in &quot;D2/3/4.
032:56:08|T|CMP|All right. Got it.
032:56:09|C|Brand|And beneath that, cross out &quot;Verb 49, maneuver to track attitude&quot; by the &quot;'C' 0, 353, 0&quot; and the &quot;HU, SCF.
032:56:28|T|CMP|All right.
032:56:30|C|Brand|Okay. The information beneath that starting with &quot;Configure camera earthshine photos&quot; down through &quot;Replace dark slide&quot; is optional. So just put in &quot;Earthshine optional&quot; as a comment there, and in the camera settings, in the block that has &quot;f:2.8 125, infinity,&quot; cross out the &quot;125&quot; and put in &quot;one-eighth,&quot; 1 slash 8, in other words.
032:57:18|T|CMP|Okay, that last part was, cross out the &quot;125&quot; and put in &quot;1/8.&quot; Is that right?
032:57:25|C|Brand|That's affirm. Okay. Next page. No change. Go to page 19.
032:57:45|T|CMP|Okay.
032:57:49|C|Brand|Okay. On the right-hand side, from the &quot;Verb 49, maneuver to earthshine attitude,&quot; down through everything up to &quot;MSFN uplink,&quot; this is optional. This is &quot;Earthshine optional.
032:58:19|T|CMP|All right. Got it.
032:58:21|C|Brand|And once again, a camera-setting correction up near the top of that section that we called optional, where you have &quot;bracket MIR f:0.9, 125&quot;, cross out the &quot;125&quot; and put in &quot;1 slash 60.&quot; In other words, one-sixtieth. Over.
032:58:46|T|CMP|Okay. Cross out the &quot;125&quot; and put in &quot;1 slash 60.
032:58:52|C|Brand|That's correct. And further down at 109:50, where you have &quot;Visual target 17&quot; et cetera, cross out that line and cross out the penned-in &quot;D17.&quot;
032:59:18|T|CMP|Okay.
032:59:27|C|Brand|Now, move to page 25.
032:59:53|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead, Vance.
032:59:54|C|Brand|Okay. At about 114:10, everything under &quot;Altitude set equals 60 miles&quot; should have the comment &quot;Solar corona, optional,&quot; and on that first line of that optional where it says &quot;Verb 49, maneuver to solar corona and limb brightening attitude,&quot; cross out &quot;And limb brightening attitude.
033:00:33|T|CMP|Okay.
033:00:35|C|Brand|Going further down to 114:16, cross out the &quot;14 DAC 18 VHBW limb brightening&quot; line and the line under that which is &quot;BRKT, MIR,&quot; et cetera.
033:00:59|T|CMP|All right.
033:01:01|C|Brand|In the block where it says &quot;Solar corona and limb brightening photos,&quot; cross out &quot;And limb brightening photos&quot; and just put &quot;Solar corona, optional.&quot;
033:01:23|T|CMP|Okay. Got it.
033:01:25|C|Brand|Going a few lines below that where you see &quot;DAC On for 4 seconds at about 50 frame rate cover lens&quot;, cross that out.
033:01:50|T|CMP|Hey, Vance, we lost you there ...?
033:01:58|C|Brand|Yes, I think we lost lock. We'll stand by a minute.
033:02:03|T|CMP|Okay, I got you back.
033:02:07|C|Brand|Okay. Going on down, cross out &quot;114:29:16, DAC On, SR dash 40 seconds.&quot;
033:02:26|T|CMP|Okay.
033:02:27|C|Brand|And at the very bottom line on that half of the page should be crossed out which is &quot;114:29:56, DAC OFF, SR.
033:02:42|T|CMP|Okay.
033:02:43|C|Brand|On the right-hand side of page 25, where you have the title &quot;Solar corona and limb brightening photography,&quot; cross out &quot;limb brightening photography.
033:02:57|T|CMP|Okay.
033:02:58|C|Brand|And in the figure, where you have the &quot;DAC LOS&quot; line, which is parallel to the X-axis on the horizon, cross out &quot;DAC LOS&quot; parallel to X-axis on horizon.
033:03:24|T|CMP|All right.
033:03:26|C|Brand|And cross out the bottom block on that half of the page which is &quot;DAC magazine percent required 12 magazines, g&quot; et cetera.
033:03:42|T|CMP|All right.
033:03:45|C|Brand|Next page, 26.
033:03:57|T|CMP|Go ahead.
033:03:58|C|Brand|Okay. Cross out the top line on the right-hand side of that page, which is &quot;DAC on for 4 seconds, 50 frame rate cover lens.&quot; And cross out the block to the right of that and down, which has &quot;Magazine percent.&quot;
033:04:35|T|CMP|All right. Got it.
033:04:40|C|Brand|Okay. Next, page 28.
033:05:08|C|Brand|Ready to go?
033:05:10|T|CMP|Go ahead.
033:05:11|C|Brand|Okay. On the left-hand side of page 28, at the very bottom, cross out &quot;Photo target 5 north, frame f:5.6, 215, infinity,&quot; et cetera. All of that line over to the vertical strip. And cross out the penned-in &quot;E4&quot; below that.
033:05:32|T|CMP|All right. Got it.
033:06:02|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
033:06:04|C|Brand|Okay, and the next page, 29, right-hand side near the top, cross out &quot;Photo target 13, north at 5.6, 250,&quot; et cetera, all of that line. And cross out beneath that the penned-in &quot;E5 slash 6.
033:06:27|T|CMP|All right.
033:06:29|C|Brand|Going to page 30, next, left-hand side.
033:06:45|T|CMP|Go ahead.
033:06:47|C|Brand|At the top at 127:01, cross out &quot;Visual target 9 on track, 180 degrees, plus 0.47,&quot; and cross out the penned-in &quot;E11&quot; beneath that.
033:07:08|T|CMP|Okay.
033:07:10|C|Brand|Going down to 127:11, cross out &quot;Verify DSE On.&quot; Beneath that a ways, cross out &quot;127:14:20, start visual observations of Fra Mauro.&quot;
033:07:34|T|CMP|All right.
033:07:36|C|Brand|Beneath that, cross out &quot;Continue visual observations,&quot; and cross out &quot;Stop observations.&quot; And beneath that, cross out &quot;Photo target 56 on track f:8, 250, infinity, 5,&quot; et cetera, to the end of that line. Cross out the &quot;5.6&quot; beneath that and the penned-in &quot;E15.&quot;
033:08:12|T|CMP|Okay.
033:08:14|C|Brand|Over in the margin, to the left of all that, make a comment: &quot;Delete visual only.&quot;
033:08:38|T|CMP|Where was that, Vance? I didn't get that last one.
033:08:42|C|Brand|Okay. That's still on page 30, on the left-hand side. In the time - in the margin at the left where you have times, just pen in beneath the &quot;127:10&quot; the following: &quot;Delete visual only.&quot; That's only a comment.
033:09:04|T|CMP|Okay. All right.
033:09:12|C|Brand|Okay. Going to page 34.
033:09:27|T|CMP|Okay.
033:09:31|C|Brand|About - on the left-hand side about almost halfway down beneath the "Verb 49, maneuver to TOPO target 54A,&quot; make the comment &quot;Target 54A is optional.&quot;
033:09:54|T|CMP|All right. Got it.
033:09:56|C|Brand|And, next, page 35, on the right-hand side. Everything from &quot;Spacecraft control, CMC, AUTO, verify&quot; on down should be given the comment &quot;Zodiacal light photos optional.&quot;
033:10:32|T|CMP|All right.
033:10:35|C|Brand|And, well, where you have the block in the middle of the page that says - the small block that says &quot;Zodiacal light photos,&quot; just put &quot;Optional&quot; in that title, too.
033:10:48|T|CMP|Okay.
033:10:50|C|Brand|And, next, page 36, on the left-hand side.
033:11:00|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
033:11:03|C|Brand|Okay. First, a comment. In the middle of the page is where the zodiacal light stuff ends, just under Verb 48. And then, if you'll go down to the bottom of the page, cross out the line &quot;Photo target 12 on track,&quot; et cetera, and cross out the &quot;E5&quot; that is below that line.
033:11:30|T|LMP|Okay, Vance, can I break in a minute?
033:11:33|C|Brand|Sure.
033:11:39|T|LMP|We have the Cryo Pressure light on now. The H<sub>2</sub> has hit its lower bound, so do you want us to go back to Auto on the H<sub>2</sub> Heater 1?
033:11:51|C|Brand|Stand by.
033:12:14|C|Brand|13, Houston.
033:12:18|T|LMP|All right, go ahead.
033:12:20|C|Brand|They request that you leave that switch in the AUTO position until you go to bed tonight. Stand by. I mean in the ON position. I'll repeat that again. In the OFF position until you go to bed tonight for reasons that you have a 3-percent imbalance, and they'd like to get that more even. So, just before turning in, we'll change the switch to AUTO.
033:12:54|T|LMP|Okay.
033:13:10|T|CMP|Okay, Vance, continue.
033:13:11|C|Brand|Okay -
033:13:12|T|CMP|Before we get away, would you ask FAO - something I didn't get briefed on - what the penned-in E5 and those letters and numbers mean?
033:13:31|C|Brand|Okay. just 1 minute.
033:13:54|C|Brand|Okay, we'll have comments on that for you in just a second.
033:14:00|T|CMP|Okay.
033:15:00|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
033:15:01|T|CMP|Okay, Vance, I'm ready to continue. I'm ready. Go ahead.
033:15:06|C|Brand|Okay, new subject. Like to break in to say that request you re-initialize the PTT - PTC. For some reason, it's gone up to 18 degrees in pitch and yaw both. We don't quite understand this. All we can think of is - start it again. Over.
033:15:27|T|CMP|Okay. We'll go back.
033:15:33|C|Brand|Okay. We are at the - the end of the changes in the solo book, and I have two pages of changes in the Flight Plan. Those are pages 3-122 and 3-125. While you're looking that up, we'll put Ken on to answer your question.
033:16:01|T|CMP|Okay. I'll start back - let me start back re-initializing PTC here.
033:16:07|C|Brand|Okay.
033:16:59|T|CDR|Okay, Vance, I'm on 3-122 of the Flight Plan.
033:17:03|C|Brand|Okay. Okay, about - at time 156:50 on the right - well, on the right-hand half of the page, there's a line which states &quot;Visual target 16, south, 180 plus 1:11, Gassendi, f:15.&quot; Request you cross out that line.
033:17:38|T|CDR|Okay, we'll crossing them out.
033:17:42|C|Brand|That's all on 3-122. Next change is 3-125.
033:18:07|T|CDR|Okay, I'm looking at 125.
033:18:10|C|Brand|Okay, starting from the top of the page, cross out the first five lines, which are &quot;Set up camera for contamination and photography, Betelgeuse, CM4/EL/80,&quot; et cetera, &quot;MAG T,&quot; et cetera, &quot;Install window shades.
033:18:35|T|CDR|I've got them crossed.
033:18:37|C|Brand|Okay, then jump down to just about 159:28. Cross out &quot;Maneuver to contamination field photography attitude,&quot; and all other lines below that through &quot;Enable thrusters A3, C4, B3,&quot; et cetera.
033:19:06|T|CDR|Okay, so we start with &quot;Maneuver to contamination field photography,&quot; and we cross out everything down to and including &quot;Enable thrusters A3, C4, B3, and D4.
033:19:16|C|Brand|That's correct. And those are all of the flight changes - Flight Plan changes we have. And Ken is coming on now and later sometime when we get PTC squared away, and it's convenient, I suppose you should read all these things back to make sure that we're squared away on them.
033:19:41|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead, TK.
033:19:48|C|Mattingly|Yes, sir. Understand you have a question.
033:19:53|T|CMP|Yes. I guess I didn't understand what the letter and the number was behind some of these photo targets.
033:20:02|C|Mattingly|Okay -
033:20:03|T|CMP|Does that refer to the pages?
033:20:05|C|Mattingly|Yes, sir. That's the map. Each fold is lettered in the lower - or upper right-hand corner if you work your way from east to west and the charts are labeled D, E, and F and the solo stuff will all be the D and E, and they change with the plane change 1. That's the time they change the two maps.
033:20:30|T|CMP|Okay. I got it. Thank you.
033:20:32|C|Mattingly|Yes, sir. You're doing good work, guy.
033:20:37|T|CMP|Well, I had a good prime crewman that taught me all I know.
033:20:43|C|Mattingly|Don't run out.
033:20:50|T|CMP|Hey, when FIDO gets a good hack on our trajectory, will you let us know?
033:20:58|C|Brand|How long you willing to wait?
033:21:03|C|Mattingly|He's looking at his calendar, if that means anything.
033:21:07|T|CMP|(Laughter) All right.
033:21:31|T|CMP|Okay. I'm back at the attitude here, and I'll wait for rates to damp and you let me know when we're stable again.
033:21:38|C|Brand|Okay. Will do.
033:22:06|P|PAO|That last exchange was between Jack Swigert in the spacecraft and Astronaut Ken Mattingly, whose been on the Capcom console along with Vance Brand, since immediately following the television transmission this evening.
033:24:00|C|Brand|13, Houston.
033:24:06|T|CMP|Go ahead, Vance.
033:24:08|C|Brand|Roger. Just a reminder you have to disable Charlie and Delta here as you've done in the past. Over.
033:24:15|T|CMP|Okay. I was kind of holding off on this. We're dumping a little waste water now.
033:24:23|C|Brand|Okay. FIDO says he knew it all along. He's - he says he's been very concerned that you've been doing a lot of water dumping.
033:30:07|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. We've got quad C and B disabled.
033:30:13|C|Brand|Okay. Copy, Jack.
033:39:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 33 hours, 40 minutes. The crew, at the present time, is still involved in eliminating rotational rates and attitude rates from the spacecraft in preparation for re-establishing a Passive Thermal Control mode. Once they get the spacecraft stable, they'll start it rotating at a rate of about 3&frac34; revolutions per hour.
033:41:12|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
033:41:16|T|LMP|Go ahead.
033:41:18|C|Brand|It may be a while before your rates are settled down. We're still observing fairly high rates and deadbanding. Over.
033:41:29|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
033:50:36|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
033:50:41|T|CMP|Go ahead, Vance.
033:50:42|C|Brand|Okay. We've got about three items. First one is, all of your P23 batch - two marks have been evaluated and - Hey, congratulations. Looks real good; they're very happy with it. You're down to 4 arc-minutes on the substellar-point aspect of it, and that's the first thing to mention. The second is, unless you see a need, I don't see any need for you to read back the information we gave you on the solo book and so forth. Do you concur?
033:51:20|T|CMP|Roger. I think I got it. I remembered a lot of it, and so I think with what you gave me and what I remember, I'm pretty sure we got it right.
033:51:36|C|Brand|Okay, and the third item, I was just about to call that your rates were stabilized to start the PTC, but it looks like they're jiggling around again from a dump, so we'll stand by some more.
033:51:55|T|CMP|Okay.
033:52:23|T|LMP|No secrets around here.
033:52:28|C|Brand|Say again. Hey, that's right.
033:52:33|T|LMP|I said there's no secrets around here.
033:52:38|C|Brand|Yes. Big Brother is watching.
033:52:50|C|Brand|13 -
033:52:51|T|CMP|I can just see EECOM telling FIDO.
033:53:03|C|Brand|Yes. You really have to watch that pair, all right. By the way, we have a maneuver PAD for you, a fly-by PAD, whenever you're ready to copy.
033:53:17|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by.
033:53:55|T|CDR|Go ahead, Vance.
033:53:57|C|Brand|Okay, maneuver PAD, purpose: fly-by, SPS/G&N; 63385; plus 0.97, minus 0.23; 072:24:33.08; plus 0212.7, minus 0141.7, minus 0254.8; 148, 316, 050; NA, plus 0022.5; 0360.9, 0:53, 0356.3; 33, 352.7, 15.0; NA, NA, NA. Starting with latitude, minus 23.26, minus 165.00; 1147.7, 36172; 166:54:02. Comments, GDC align stars are 31, Arcturus; and 23, Denebola. R align 288, pitch align 205, yaw align 034; ullage, none; other, burn is SPS docked. LM weight, 33499. Over.
033:57:39|T|CDR|Our PAD as follows: fly-by, SPS/G&N; 63385; plus 0.97, minus 0.23; 072:24:33.08; plus 0212.7, minus 0141.7, minus 0254.8; 148, 316, 050; NA, plus 0022.5; 0360.9, 0:53, 0356.3; 33, 352.7, 15.0; NA, NA, NA; minus 23.26, minus 165.00; 1147.7, 36172; 166:54:02; set stars 31, 23; roll is 288, pitch 205, yaw 034; no ullage; SPS docked; and LM weight, 33499.
033:59:20|C|Brand|Roger. That's correct. Want to verify under Noun 81 that Delta-V<sub>X</sub> is plus 02127. You cut out right there.
033:59:35|T|CDR|Roger. Delta-V<sub>X</sub> is 02127.
033:59:40|C|Brand|Roger. And your rates are low. Looks like you can start the PTC.
033:59:51|T|CMP|Okay. In work.
033:59:54|C|Brand|Okay. And when the computer is available, request P00 and Accept and we'll ship you your state vector.
034:00:07|T|CDR|Wait until I get PTC going first, Vance, then we'll give it to you.
034:00:10|C|Brand|Okay.
034:02:41|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. We're P00 and Accept. The computer's yours.
034:02:48|C|Brand|Roger. Here it comes.
034:03:09|T|CMP|You know, somehow, everytime I do a set of P23s, you guys uplink me a state vector. I don't think I do too well.
034:03:24|C|Brand|No -
034:03:25|T|CMP|I could get a complex.
034:03:26|C|Brand|No. You know - you know how the FIDOs are. They like to load in their own data, no matter what.
034:03:44|T|CMP|But our state vectors take into account the waste water dumps.
034:03:56|C|Brand|Yes, that's -
034:05:28|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston. It's your computer again.
034:05:33|T|CMP|Okay. Going to Block.
034:05:36|C|Brand|And as a matter of interest, understand that the downrange comparison between the MCC and the computer is within 35,000 feet, and that's on the last sighting, which people think is pretty good.
034:05:56|T|CMP|Okay. Maybe that gives us a little more confidence that if we had to do P23s on the way home, we'd make it.
034:06:05|C|Brand|No doubt about it.
034:13:19|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 34 hours, 13 minutes. At this time, the crew has very little to complete before beginning their sleep period. They still had a lithium hydroxide canister to change out. Following that, we expect they'll begin their eat period, and it's possible that they will begin the sleep period somewhat earlier than the scheduled 37 hours in the Flight Plan. Our latest estimate on the impact of the S-IVB, the Saturn third stage on the lunar surface, is that this event will occur 77 hours ,57 minutes, 37 seconds; and our current tracking data indicates that the impact point will be 0 degrees, 56 minutes north; 29 degrees, 33 minutes west. Apollo 13 at this time is 130,736 nautical miles [242,123 km] from the Earth travelling at a speed of 4,402 feet per second [1,342 m/s].
034:41:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 34 hours, 42 minutes. Our Guidance and Control officer reports that the spacecraft appears to be remaining quite stable in the Passive Thermal Control mode. The spacecraft rotating slowly to maintain the proper thermal balance as the normal mode for the spacecraft to be in during sleep periods and periods of low crew activity. Jim Lovell advised some time ago - a couple of hours ago, that the crew might begin the sleep period early. He said if they had any problem getting to sleep or if they weren't particularly sleepy at the time they finished their other scheduled activities, that they might review some of their lunar charts before turning in for the 10 hours rest period. At this time Apollo 13 is 131,948 nautical miles [244,368 km] from Earth, travelling at a speed of 4,368 feet per second [1,331 m/s]. At 34 hours, 43 minutes; this is Mission Control, Houston.
034:58:16|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
034:58:21|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
034:58:23|C|Brand|Just info on your PTC, Jim. It's looking very good. Just - excursions in pitch and yaw are very low.
034:58:34|T|CDR|Okay, thank you. And we're going to change another lithium hydroxide canister now.
034:58:42|C|Brand|Okay.
034:58:54|T|CMP|And, Vance. Has FIDO come up with any observations on the trajectory?
034:59:02|C|Brand|Well, a minute ago, he said that to tell you that he was pacified now after your past comments on his trajectory and so forth, and he hadn't seen any waste water dumps or anything and he's pretty happy.
034:59:24|T|CMP|Okay. I just wondered if we're going to need any more midcourse.
034:59:36|C|Brand|He says, seriously, it's looking probably like you won't have any more.
034:59:45|T|CMP|Hey, that's real fine.
034:59:49|C|Brand|FIDOs never guarantee anything, however.
034:59:55|T|CMP|Yes. That's right.
035:04:50|T|CMP|Houston, 13. I have the onboard read-outs, if you're ready to copy.
035:04:57|C|Brand|Roger. Go ahead.
035:05:01|T|CMP|Okay. Bat C, 37; Pyro Bat A, 37; Pyro Bat B, 37; RCS A, 97 percent; B, 97 percent; C, 96 percent; D, 97 percent.
035:05:27|C|Brand|Roger. We copy that. Thank you.
035:26:56|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
035:27:05|T|CDR|Go ahead, Vance.
035:27:07|C|Brand|Jim, just an item for you and Fred to be thinking about in case you haven't been briefed on this, something that's now being talked about a little bit. These conservative people would like to have you read the SHe tank pressure when you go into the LM for the LM familiarization at 58 hours. If there's no midcourse-3, and it looks like there's a good chance that there will not be, why, they might want to move the LM familiarization up from 58 to 55 hours. Over.
035:27:50|T|CDR|Okay. If we don't have a midcourse-3, then we'll probably move LM FAM up to 55 hours, in which case we'll go in there and read SHe tank pressure.
035:28:02|C|Brand|Roger. Along with the other FAM stuff, and it's not certain that we want to do this, it's just being talked about, so this is just the information for you.
035:28:18|T|CDR|Okay. This is beginning to sound like the SIM that we ran not too long ago.
035:28:29|C|Brand|I don't think it will be a very big deal.
035:43:42|T|CMP|Okay. Houston, 13.
035:43:46|C|Brand|This is Houston. Go ahead.
035:43:50|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. Our LM/CM Delta-P is 0.9.
035:43:58|C|Brand|Roger. 0.9.
035:44:05|T|CMP|Roger.
035:46:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 35 hours, 46 minutes. The Flight Dynamics officer has just recomputed a new impact point for the S-IVB, based on later tracking data. The current figures predict that the S-IVB will impact the Moon at a Ground Elapsed Time of 77 hours, 56 minutes, 54 seconds; and the coordinates of the impact are now predicted to be 2 degrees, 35 minutes south, and 28 degrees, 31 minutes west. These continue to be preliminary figures and we expect that there is a good chance they will be updated as we get further tracking data on the S-IVB. At the present time Apollo 13 is 134,624 nautical miles [249,324 km] from Earth, traveling at a speed of 4,292 feet per second [1,308 m/s].
036:42:10|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
036:42:14|T|LMP|Go ahead, Vance.
036:42:17|C|Brand|Are you guys hacking into your presleep checklist yet?
036:42:24|T|LMP|Oh, we just finished eating and cleaning up a bit afterwards. Jim's going around collecting debris off of all the inlet hoses. And, I guess you might say we're kind of thinking about getting ready to go to sleep.
036:42:47|C|Brand|Well, I hope you had a good meal.
036:43:01|C|Brand|Sounds like you guys are really living it up, up there. All that music, food. I didn't say drink.
036:43:09|T|LMP|Yes, it is pretty nice. Not bad at all. You're right; you didn't say it. This PTC we're in is a pretty - pretty nice merry-go-round, Vance. Every 10 minutes alternately I get to look at the Earth and the Moon.
036:43:40|C|Brand|You couldn't ask for anything more than that. Just so it isn't so fast you -
036:43:44|T|LMP|No, it's a lot - a lot better. I remember from 8 when they didn't hardly ever get to look at either one.
036:43:57|C|Brand|That's right. They were tumbling about another axis, weren't they.
036:44:03|T|LMP|Yes.
036:44:31|T|LMP|It's pretty cloudy down there tonight. About the only land I can see again is a portion of Australia and Korea and looks like a part of China. Just about clouds covering everything else.
036:44:51|C|Brand|Can you still see that clearly with the naked eye, or do you have to look through a glass?
036:45:01|T|LMP|I can see Australia with the naked eye and the China landmass, but I - It took the monocular to pull out the Korean Peninsula.
036:45:15|C|Brand|How about the Moon? Is it looking very big yet?
036:45:21|T|LMP|No, not really. Bigger, but we've got a ways to go.
036:45:31|C|Brand|I understand that they're estimating your pericynthion - lunar pericynthion is now 62 [nautical] miles [115 km].
036:45:46|T|LMP|Well, that's not bad.
036:45:47|C|Brand|That's supposed to be just right.
036:45:50|T|LMP|Yes.
036:46:25|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; 13.
036:46:28|C|Brand|Go ahead, Jack.
036:46:31|T|CMP|Okay. We're into the presleep checklist now. As far as the crew status report, as far as medication goes, we've had no medication. And we're all feeling really good. I've given you the onboard readouts. Jim is chlorinating the potable water now. I'm ready for an E-memory dump whenever you're ready.
036:47:01|C|Brand|Stand by 1 on the E-memory dump, Jack. I think we'll be ready in about a minute.
036:47:12|T|Brand|And EECOM says that as soon as you stir your cryos, request you go back to Auto on that one tank.
036:47:25|T|CMP|Okay. We'll do that.
036:48:14|C|Brand|Hello, 13; Houston. We're ready to take your E-memory dump.
036:48:21|T|CMP|Okay. Coming down.
036:50:07|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 36 hours, 50 minutes. During that last series of conversations, Jack Swigert passed along the crew physical status, reporting that they've taken no medication and they're all feeling fine. Prior to that, Fred Haise gave us an out-the-window description of the Earth and Moon. Fred also played back a short sample of the music that they have on board the spacecraft and reported that the food was fine. Apollo 13 at this time is 137,250 nautical miles [254,187 km] from Earth, travelling at a speed of 4,219 feet per second [1,286 m/s]. The crew should be beginning their scheduled 10-hour rest period shortly. That rest period is scheduled to begin at a Ground Elapsed Time of 37 hours. They've completed all items in the Flight Plan necessary to beginning the sleep period. At 36 hours, 52 minutes; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
037:07:15|C|Lousma|Apollo 13, Houston. Were you trying to call?
037:07:20|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
037:07:29|T|CDR|Houston, 13.
037:07:33|C|Lousma|Apollo 13, Houston. We thought you were trying to call. Were you?
037:07:38|T|CDR|I don't believe so unless we inadvertently hit the microphone button.
037:07:48|T|LMP|Must have been some other guy trying to call, Jack.
037:07:53|T|CDR|Just trying to get some words in, eh Jack?
037:07:58|C|Lousma|Roger. We saw the downvoice subperiod come on. We thought maybe you were trying to call. Sorry. I hope we haven't disturbed you and from where I sit, it looks like you're running a rest home up there. Good night.
037:08:14|T|CDR|We're all going to bed now just after we play the last rendition of 'With Our Eyes on the Stars.'
037:08:29|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. And we'd like you to check your S-Band Normal voice switch, Off.
037:08:37|T|CDR|S-Band Normal, Off.
037:10:42|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 37 hours, 11 minutes. That was Jim Lovell reporting just a few minutes ago that the crew was ready to begin their 10-hour sleep period. That sleep period is scheduled to end at 47 hours Ground Elapsed Time. Here in Mission Control, astronaut Jack Lousma has replaced astronaut Vance Brandt as Capsule Communicator.
037:11:09|T|CDR|Houston, 13. We'll be off comm; so if you need us, send a crew alert, please.
037:11:44|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. If we need you, we'll send a crew alert, and we'd like to know who's got the duty tonight on the biomed. Is that you?
037:12:03|T|CDR|Yes. I'll be on the biomed.
037:12:09|C|Lousma|Okay. We copy, and you're spoiling my good record of two watches without saying anything.
037:12:24|T|CDR|Just want to keep you busy, Jack.
037:12:27|C|Lousma|You're waking me up.
038:07:28|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 38 hours, 8 minutes. The crew is now about one hour into their scheduled ten-hour rest period and here in Mission Control the activity has settled down primarily to watching the spacecraft systems. At the present time Apollo 13 is 140,357 nautical miles [259,941 kilometres] from the Earth travelling at a speed of 4,135 feet per second [1,260 metres per second]. At 38 hours, 8 minutes; this is Mission Control, Houston.
039:19:34|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control of 39 hours, 20 minutes. We're now some 2&frac12; hours into the scheduled 10-hour rest period. The flight surgeon reports that Jim Lovell appears to be sleeping soundly at this time. Lovell is the only crewman who is wearing a biomedical harness, according to the plan. We have almost a little more than 7&frac12; hours remaining in the sleep period. All spacecraft systems continue to function normally at this time. Apollo 13 now 143,222 nautical miles [265,247 km] from Earth and the spacecraft velocity is 4,059 feet per second [1,237 m/s]. At 39 hours, 21 minutes; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
040:00:01|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 40 hours. Seven hours remain in the crew's sleep period. Apollo 13 is 144,784 nautical miles [268,140 km] from Earth; velocity, 4,019 feet per second [1,225 m/s]. The latest S-IVB impact time update places impact of the third stage of the booster on the lunar surface at 77 hours, 57 minutes, 4 seconds. Predicted coordinates of impact: 2 degrees, 10 minutes south; 28 degrees, 50 minutes west. This is Mission Control, Houston.
041:00:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 41 hours. Everything continues to go well aboard Apollo 13 as the three crewmen begin the fifth hour of their scheduled 10-hour rest period. Apollo 13 is 147,103 nautical miles [272,435 km] from Earth. Traveling at a velocity of 3,960 feet per second [1,207 m/s]. This is Mission Control, Houston.
042:00:01|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 42 hours. Apollo 13 is now 149,375 nautical miles [276,642 km] from Earth, velocity 3,903 feet per second [1,190 m/s]. The crewmen are at the midpoint now of their 10-hour rest period. That rest period due to end about 47 hours Elapsed Time. This is Mission Control, Houston.
043:00:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 43 hours. Four hours remains in the Apollo 13 crew's rest period. Spacecraft is 151,625 nautical miles [280,809 km] from Earth, traveling at a velocity of 3,847 feet per second [1,173 m/s]. The Flight Dynamics Officer has again updated the expected S-IVB impact time and coordinates. We are predicting S-IVB impact at 77 hours, 57 minutes, 9 seconds. Coordinates of the impact location on the Moon: 2 degrees, 11 minutes south; 28 degrees, 58 minutes west. News men in the news center can see the impact point in relationship to landing zones on the monitors in the news center at this time. This is Mission Control, Houston.
043:17:01|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 43 hours, 17 minutes. Three briefings on future programs are scheduled for this morning in the briefing room at the MSC News Center. Topics and times are Space Station at 9:00 AM, the Space Shuttle at 10:00 AM, and the Reusable Space Tug at 11:00 AM. All three of these briefings will be conducted in the briefing room in the MSC News Center.
043:42:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 43 hours, 42 minutes. Apollo 13 is 153,172 nautical miles [283,675 km] from Earth, travelling at a velocity of 3,809 feet per second [1,161 m/s]. 3 hours, 17 minutes remains in the crew's rest period. Astronaut Joe Kerwin is the Capcom now. This morning's briefings on future programs in the MSC News Center will be carried on this release line. The first one begins in about 5 minutes at 9:00 AM, CST. The topic of that briefing is Space Stations. This is Mission Control Houston.
044:42:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 44 hours, 42 minutes. Apollo 13's distance now is 155,379 nautical miles [287,762 km], velocity is 3,756 feet per second [1,145 m/s], and 2 hours, 17 minutes remains in the rest period. Mid-course correction number 3 will not be required. Because of this, the plan now is to move the LM activation time and the TV transmission time from the 58 hours under the plan with the mid-course back to 55 hours. LM activation and the TV transmission time will now be at 55 hours Elapsed Time. That's about 8:13 PM CST this evening. The next briefing in the MSC News Room will begin in approximately 5 minutes. The topic will be Space Shuttles, and that briefing will be carried on this line. This is Mission Control, Houston.
045:47:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 45 hours, 47 minutes. Crew wakeup time is 1 hour, 12 minutes away. Apollo 12 [means Apollo 13] is 157,720 nautical miles [292,097 km] from Earth. Its velocity is 3,701 feet per second [1,128 m/s]. The 11 AM briefing on reusable space tug will be carried on this line. This is Mission Control, Houston.
046:43:18|T|CDR|Houston, Houston, Apollo 13. Over.
046:43:22|C|Kerwin|Good morning, 13. You're early.
046:43:27|T|CDR|Ah so. I just thought we'd wake you up, and we're awake and getting the spacecraft shipshape. ...
046:43:38|C|Kerwin|Roger. Spacecraft is in real good shape as far as we're concerned, Jim. We're bored to tears down here. We do have a few little items for you, like a P37 update and a couple of Flight Plan updates. But there's no rush about them. Over.
046:43:42|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 46 hours, 43 minutes. Spacecraft Commander, Jim Lovell has just put in a call to us 16 minutes prior to wake up time. Here's that conversation.
046:43:55|T|CDR|Okay. Gig us again in a few minutes. We're breaking out some food, and we'll copy them then.
046:44:01|C|Kerwin|Okay. And the Surgeon will be ready for your sleep report whenever you get that together.
046:44:08|T|CDR|Righto. If he's listening, LMP had a solid 9 hours of sleep; I couldn't wake him up this morning. The CMP had 6 hours, and the Commander about 5 intermittent.
046:44:22|C|Kerwin|Okay -
046:44:24|T|CDR|Jack's dosimeter - Jack's dosimeter is reading 02026.
046:44:32|C|Kerwin|Okay. We got it.
046:44:36|T|CDR|It might be interesting that just after we went to sleep last night we had a Master Alarm and it really scared us. And we were all over the cockpit like a wet noodle.
046:44:45|C|Kerwin|(Laughter) Sorry it wasn't something more significant. I've also got a procedure for you on that H<sub>2</sub> tank; simple thing after you get done stirring up the cryos.
046:44:59|T|CDR|Okay.
046:46:55|T||(Music)
046:47:10|C|Kerwin|That was beautiful. What was it?
046:47:16|T|CDR|A little of 'With Their Eyes on the Stars' to wake up to.
046:47:24|C|Kerwin|Sounds like all the comforts of home. Have you guys got a flower on your breakfast table?
046:47:33|T|CDR|Yes. Jack!
046:49:14|P|PAO|The Capcom is astronaut Joe Kerwin. With him at his console is the backup crew commander John Young.
046:50:29|P|PAO|Apollo 13 is 159,967 nautical miles [296,259 km] from Earth; velocity, 3,649 feet per second [1,112 m/s].
046:52:37|P|PAO|The Flight Dynamics Officer has again updated the S-IVB impact time and location. Impact time; 77 hours, 57 minutes, 5 seconds. Coordinates: 1 degree, 54 minutes south; 28 degrees, 47 minutes west.
047:38:10|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 13. Over.
047:38:13|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
047:38:24|C|Kerwin|13, this is Houston. Go.
047:38:28|T|CDR|Roger, Joe. We're standing by for that P37 block data if you have it for us.
047:38:32|C|Kerwin|Okay. Got it right here, Jim, and it follows. This is the P37 PAD for lift-off plus 60. The reason for the update is for weather avoidance in the MPL at 119 hours. It's the same one we passed you yesterday, and it's the same weather, but we still don't expect a problem at the end of the mission. GET<sub>I</sub> is 060:00; Delta-V<sub>T</sub>, 6,079; longitude, minus 153; GET 400K, 118:04. Over.
047:39:18|T|CDR|GET<sub>I</sub> of 060:00, 6079, minus 153, 118:04.
047:39:29|C|Kerwin|Roger. That's correct. I've got a consumables update for you, Jim, if you're ready for that.
047:39:41|T|CDR|Ready to copy.
047:39:43|C|Kerwin|Okay. As of 47 hours; RCS total, 1,096; quad Alpha, 270; Bravo, 278; Charlie, 270; Delta, 278; and the H<sub>2</sub> - They gave me the H<sub>2</sub>s in percent, 76 percent; and on the O<sub>2</sub> we have 81 percent. However, we show the O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 reading off-scale high now. We're quite sure it's a sensor failure. We'd like you to verify it with your onboard reading.
047:40:29|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by.
047:40:47|T|CDR|Joe, we confirm. Our gauge reading is - on the number 2 O<sub>2</sub> tank is reading off-scale high now, but Jack just tells me that it was okay when we first looked at it this morning.
047:41:00|C|Kerwin|We verify that. At 46:45 we had 82 percent and apparently when he stirred the, the cryos, the sensor broke.
047:41:17|T|CDR|Okay.
047:41:19|C|Kerwin|So it's no problem. You're above nominal on all your consumables. On the H<sub>2</sub> tank problem, we have a procedure that we'd like you to carry out which is simply turning the H<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters to Off at this time, and we want to see whether that won't solve the problem of the tank pressure setting off caution and warning. We want to look at it that way for a few hours.
047:41:47|T|CDR|Okay. You want both H<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters to Off. Is that correct?
047:41:51|C|Kerwin|That's negative; just tank 2. We want tank 1 to stay in Auto.
047:41:57|T|CDR|Okay. Tank 2 heaters Off at this time.
047:42:00|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good deal. That's been the high tank and apparently while waiting for that pressure switch to close, to start the heater cycle, the tank 1 pressure has been dropping even a little bit lower and just setting off caution and warning, so we feel if we turn off the tank 2 heater and let tank 1 activate the heater cycle, we won't get into the caution and warning range.
047:42:25|T|CDR|Roger.
047:42:26|C|Kerwin|Okey, Jim. At your convenience we'd like P00 and Accept. We're ready for - to uplink your state vector now since we will not do midcourse 3. Over.
047:42:38|T|CDR|Roger. You're in P00 and Accept, no midcourse 3, and we're all set for a state vector update and I'm giving you the LM/CM Delta-P here shortly.
047:42:46|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good deal. And I have Flight Plan updates for you later, at your convenience.
047:43:18|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 13. The LM/CM Delta-P is 1.0 psi.
047:43:23|C|Kerwin|Copy, 1.0, Jim.
047:44:37|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 13. I'm about ready for any Flight Plan updates that you have.
047:44:40|C|Kerwin|Okay, 13. To start off with, got a minor procedural change for Jack on his next P52, if he's ready to listen to that.
047:44:54|T|CDR|Okay. Jack's still off comm. We'll hold off on that a little bit and then we'll pick it up when he gets on comm.
047:45:01|C|Kerwin|Okay; fine. I've got two updates for you, Jim. One is a procedure for looking for Comet Bennett at about 49:45, and I'll wait till Jack gets up before passing you the details on that. The other update is concerned with going into the LM three hours early, and I think Vance mentioned to you last night that this was a possibility, that we'd like to look at the SHe tank pressure early. And since we're not going to do midcourse 3, we'd like LM entry at 55 hours. Is that okay with you?
047:45:41|T|CDR|Okay. Right, that's fine with us. We'll move up LM entry to 55 hours.
047:45:48|C|Kerwin|Okay. I've got some details on the Flight Plan for you as follows. Of course, since there's no MCC-3, you'll be deleting all the midcourse 3 stuff including the - the P52, which is called out at about 54&frac12;, and we'll be slipping that until later, which I'll - which I'll tell - which I'll tell - which I'll tell you in a minute. Okay. Then you - we want to move the battery charge up three hours to about 52:30. And we want to move the - moving the LM tunnel vent valve to LM/CM Delta-P up three hours to 52:45, and at that point you can simply go to the 57-hour point in the Flight Plan and change your number from 57 hours to 54 hours and start through that. In the remarks section at about 57:50 it says, 'O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste water dump,' here. If not performed earlier, we want you to do that at 54 hours and 50 minutes. The TV pass then, will be at 55 hours to 55:30. You'll go right through the LM Activation checklist stuff. I'm losing you; let's wait a minute.
047:47:41|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. How do you read me?
047:48:05|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. You back with us?
047:49:14|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. Are you back with us?
047:49:19|T|CDR|We're back with you.
047:49:20|C|Kerwin|Okay. I've gone through the battery charge, the LM vent valve, the fuel cell purge, and then stop PTC at 55 hours, and your roll attitude there will be 285 degrees, which is per the Flight Plan. The High Gain Antenna angles are slightly different, pitch 23 and yaw 267 degrees. The TV pass till 55:30, the standard LM activation except for some special steps we'll give you to take a look at SHe tank pressure, which I don't have yet. Restart PTC at about 56:30 or whenever you're through with the LM activities, and after that, at your convenience, we'd like you to - to do the P52 option 3 that we cancelled at 54&frac12; hours. Over.
047:50:27|T|CDR|Okay. That last comment was that we'll do the P52 after we start PTC at about 56:30.
047:50:31|C|Kerwin|That's right. Any time after that; it's not time critical.
047:50:43|T|CDR|Okay. Let's see if I have some of this, Joe. Around 52:30 we're to do the battery charge on Bat - battery B.
047:50:52|C|Kerwin|That's correct.
047:50:54|T|CDR|And then about 52:40 we're going to do the LM tunnel vent valve, and the LM/CM Delta-P which has been written up at 55:40.
047:51:04|C|Kerwin|That's correct.
047:51:09|T|CDR|We're deleting midcourse-3 and we've moved up the LM entry to 55 hours. So we'll merely follow all the - We'll follow all the procedures that leads up to LM entry that was originally scheduled for 58.
047:51:29|C|Kerwin|That's correct. You can start at 57 in the Flight Plan; call it 54 hours and press right on.
047:51:48|T|CDR|Okay. Then whenever we're finished with the LM, which we anticipate around 56:30, we'll commence PTC and sometime after that we'll do a P52.
047:51:59|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative. And did you copy the new High Gain angles for 55 hours? The ones we had -
047:52:12|T|CDR|Okay. We're going to stop the PTC for LM entry at roll 285, and High Gain angles are pitch 23 and yaw 267.
047:52:23|C|Kerwin|That's correct, Jim. And, 13, Houston. The computer is yours.
047:52:35|T|CDR|The computer is ours. We're in Block, and exactly when do you want the TV to be cranked up?
047:52:41|C|Kerwin|You can crank it up sometime prior to 55 hours at your convenience just to set it up. We'll be expecting transmission at 55 hours.
047:52:55|T|CDR|Okay.
047:53:46|T|CDR|And, Houston, Apollo 13. One thing I missed about the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste and water dump.
047:53:53|C|Kerwin|Roger. We'd like the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste water dump at 54:50.
047:54:04|T|CDR|Roger. We'll pick up those items at 54:50.
047:54:30|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
047:54:35|T|CMP|Go ahead, Joe.
047:54:36|C|Kerwin|All right, Jack. One thing we'd like to have done sometime soon is to have you cycle the cryo fans in O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 one more time. We'd like to see if we can get that sensor back.
047:54:50|T|CMP|Okay. O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 fan on now.
047:54:55|C|Kerwin|Roger.
047:56:08|T|CDR|Houston, 13.
047:56:09|C|Kerwin|Go, 13.
047:56:14|T|CDR|We - We have just one question, the LM tunnel vent valve. We're questioning why we're venting until the Delta-P is greater than 1.7 if we are going to open up the tunnel, then pressurize the LM usually.
047:56:27|C|Kerwin|Right. Stand by on that.
047:56:51|C|Kerwin|13, Houston.
047:56:55|T|CDR|Go ahead.
047:56:56|C|Kerwin|Roger. The word on that, Jim, is that they want to ensure the proper O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the LM when you get to the surface, and this is a method of doing that by bleeding out additional nitrogen.
047:57:12|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
047:57:21|C|Kerwin|And, 13, Houston. If Jack is up, I'd like to talk to him about the P52, briefly.
047:57:29|T|CDR|Okay. He's here.
047:57:31|T|CMP|Go ahead, Joe.
047:57:32|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. What they'd like you to do on this P52 at 49 hours, they've been observing a slight jitter in the optics shaft angle of about 0.2 of a degree plus or minus. Before you come out of the Optics zero position, at the start of this P52, they'd like you to just observe the shaft readout, and see if the jitter occurs on your direct readout there, and also they'd like you to briefly call up a Verb 16, Noun 91 so we can look at the shaft and trunnion angles.
047:58:11|T|CMP|Okay. Let's see if I got it right. On the P52 at 49 hours, before coming out of zero on the Optics, observe the shaft and also call up 16, 91 and let you look at the shaft and trunnion angles to observe a possible jitter. See whether it occurs in the zero position as well as out of zero.
047:58:33|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jack. That's correct; and if you have time, now, I've got a Flight Plan update for you on looking for the Comet Bennett.
047:58:50|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by one, Joe. And the commander's going off the air briefly.
047:58:58|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
048:00:02|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. I'm ready to copy the update on Bennett now.
048:00:04|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. I'm going to read it to you, and then add some comments and we'll talk about it a little. This should occur sometime after 49:30. After the P52 realign at 49 hours, if time permits, we would like the crew to investigate while in PTC if there is a roll angle in which the comet can be observed for photos. If there is, record the optimum roll angle for possible photography, prior to reinitiating PTC at 56:30 or so, whenever the guys are done in the LM, use P52 planet option, and the following half-unit vectors for tracking Comet Bennett at about 49:46. Are you ready to copy half-unit vectors? Over.
048:01:05|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead, Joe.
048:01:07|C|Kerwin|Okay. R1, plus 0.34202; R2, minus 0.07374; R3, plus 0.35719. Read back.
048:01:33|T|CMP|Okay. Copy. R1, plus 34202; R2, minus 07374; R3, plus 35719.
048:01:48|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's correct and the last sentence on the update is that you can expect AOS of the comet at a roll of 45 degrees and LOS at a roll of 155 degrees. Now, the deal here, Jack, according to the plots they showed me is, the comet appears to be about 10 degrees away from the Sun, and due to the geometry of the LM there shadowing the Sun, it would appear that you will be able to see the comet through the sextant without getting Sun shafting between roll angles of about 45 degrees and 75 degrees. It appears that as your roll gets higher than 75 degrees, although the comet is still in the field of view, the Sun is also in the field of view, and you probably will not have any success between 75 and 155 if you haven't got it from 45 to 75. If you do find that you can see the comet somewhere between 45 and 75 or 80 degrees, just note that roll angle and then if it's feasible we'd like you to photograph it after the LM entry part of the checklist. Over.
048:03:10|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. Let me give it back to you and see if I've got it here. After the P52, during our PTC you want us to use P52 and observe Bennett's Comet through the sextant; note a roll angle if we can find it visible. It would be visible somewhere between - ideally between 45 and 75 degrees, and we should lose it about 155 roll, and if we do see it, make an observation of whether it is photographable, note the roll angle for photographs to be taken after or prior to initiation of PTC at 56:30.
048:03:58|C|Kerwin|That's exactly right, Jack.
048:04:04|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine.
048:06:20|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
048:06:24|T|CMP|Go ahead, Joe.
048:06:25|C|Kerwin|We're ready to have to O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 fan off, and thank you.
048:06:32|T|CMP|Okay. Doesn't look like we got it back, huh?
048:06:35|C|Kerwin|No, it doesn't, Jack.
048:32:08|P|PAO|At 48 hours, 32 minutes, Apollo 13's distance is 163,513 nautical miles [302,826 km]; velocity, 3,568 feet per second [1,088 m/s].
048:48:42|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 48 hours, 48 minutes. At the Control Center, the Gold team, led by Gerry Griffin, is in the process of turning over to Gene Kranz and his White team. We're estimating a change of shift News Conference with Gerry Griffin for 2:30 PM CST in the briefing room at the MSC News Center.
049:01:01|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 13.
049:01:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston at 49 hours, 1 minute now into the flight of Apollo 13. The Apollo 13 spacecraft -
049:01:20|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 13.
049:01:22|C|Kerwin|Hey, 13; Houston. Go ahead.
049:01:26|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. I've started into P52 here. I've proceeded on option 3, and on the dis - 1520 - 1525 display, I've called up 16 91. I'm going to let you observe and see while the - the shaft angle while the Optics are still in zero.
049:01:47|C|Kerwin|Okay. Roger that, Jack. We're looking at it, and I'll give you a mark as soon as G&amp;C is happy.
049:01:55|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine.
049:02:12|P|PAO|That was Jack Swigert, Command Module Pilot. He's aligning his spacecraft platform at this time.
049:02:26|C|Kerwin|13 Houston. Jack, could you give us a readout on your counter now?
049:02:35|T|CMP|Okay. I'm showing a shaft of 0.2 and a trunnion of 359.92.
049:02:48|C|Kerwin|Roger. Copy that. Is there any jumping around on the shaft?
049:02:57|T|CMP|You mean on the TPAC readout?
049:02:59|C|Kerwin|Yes.
049:03:02|T|CMP|As a matter of fact, it went from 0.2 to 0.21.
049:03:08|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that. Stand by one.
049:03:13|T|CMP|Okay. Now it went down - It went down as low as 0.15.
049:03:18|C|Kerwin|Okay.
049:03:41|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. Apollo 13 now 164,602 nautical miles [304,843 km] away from Earth, traveling at a speed of 3,544 feet per second [1,080 m/s].
049:04:09|C|Kerwin|Jack, Houston. Let us watch that for another minute or so.
049:04:15|T|CMP|Okay. I'm in no hurry. It looked like it burned between 0.14 and 0.8 with an occasional spike up to 0.2.
049:04:24|C|Kerwin|Roger.
049:05:30|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
049:06:04|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. You can press on with P52 now. Over.
049:06:10|T|CMP|Okay, Joe.
049:06:24|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. In the Mission Control Center, Gene Kranz is taking the reins of the flight control team. He's sporting a flashy white vest in the best traditions of his team color. Joe Kerwin remains on as the Capsule Communicator with the spacecraft. We are at 49 hours, 6 minutes into the flight and Apollo 13 is presently 164,698 nautical miles [305,020 km] out from Earth, traveling at a speed of 3,541 feet per second [1,079 m/s]. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
049:08:17|T|CMP|Hey, Houston, are we clear to torque? Are you reading the torquing angles?
049:08:28|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead and torque.
049:08:35|T|CMP|Okay. Time of torquing will be 49 hours, 8 minutes, 35 seconds.
049:08:41|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
049:09:18|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston at 49 hours, and 9 minutes into the flight, the change of shift news conference is still estimated - has an estimated start of 2:30. Meanwhile in Mission Control, Flight Dynamics has updated our S-IVB impact coordinates in time. We are presently looking at coordinates of 2 degree, 18 minutes south; 28 degrees, 55 zero [sic] minutes west at a Ground Elapsed Time of 77 hours, 57 minutes, 5 seconds. Apollo 13 is now 164,814 nautical miles [305,236 km] away from Earth, traveling at a speed of 3,539 feet per second [1,079 m/s].
049:10:13|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
049:10:17|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
049:10:19|C|Kerwin|Roger. For Jack, we missed the star angle difference on the P52. Would you read us that?
049:10:30|T|CDR|Roger, Houston. It was all balls.
049:10:32|C|Kerwin|Okay. Thank you.
049:10:39|P|PAO|That was Jim Lovell, Spacecraft Commander, responding to Joe Kerwin. We are at 49 hours, 11 minutes now into the flight, and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
049:15:14|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 49 hours, 15 minutes now into the flight. We'll take down our air-to-ground line at this time since the change of shift briefing is now scheduled to begin. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
049:32:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston, 49 hours, 32 minutes now since lift-off. Apollo 13 presently 165,573 nautical miles [306,641 km] out from Earth, traveling at a velocity of 3,522 feet per second [1,074 m/s]. Since we took the line down for the change of shift briefing, we've had no voice communications with the crew, however, we will leave the line open at this time and stand by and continue to monitor. At 49 hours, 33 minutes into the flight; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
049:34:52|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 49 hours, 35 minutes since lift-off. We are presently looking at the start of LM activation at 55 hours, Ground Elapsed Time, and Goldstone will be feeding the TV transmission at that time. Apollo 13 now 165,675 nautical miles [306,830 km] away from Earth, and traveling at a speed of 3,520 feet per second [1,072 m/s]. We are 49 hours, 36 minutes; and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
049:42:38|T|CMP|Hey, Houston; 13.
049:42:40|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
049:42:44|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. I got into P52 about 49:34. We loaded the planet - or Bennett Comet vectors into the planet option, and P52 tracked it all the way across except that it was always occulted by the LM, and we're in a roll angle of 155 now.
049:43:09|C|Kerwin|Roger. We're copying your roll angles. At what roll angle were you able to start tracking it, Jack?
049:43:24|T|CMP|Okay. At the time we entered it there, we were about 66 degrees roll, so either we started too late, or maybe somehow we got a wrong calculation on the roll angle.
049:43:40|C|Kerwin|Okay. Let me have G&amp;C comment on that. I suspect that the roll angles we gave you were calculated for exactly 90 degrees pitch, and you're probably wobbling enough that they're not exactly correct.
049:44:02|T|CDR|Yes, I think you - You probably got the right idea.
049:45:24|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Over.
049:45:29|T|CMP|Go ahead.
049:45:30|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. Notice you've secured from that, and that was going to be our recommendation, anyway. We're going to have the guys in the back room look at it and see if they can come up with some - with some better numbers based on the cone angle that - that you're traveling through, whether there are any roll angles that - that are available to you. And if there are, and we have time, we might give it another try; if not, we just will forget it.
049:46:05|T|CMP|Okay.
049:48:17|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
049:48:22|T|CMP|Go ahead, Joe.
049:48:27|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. I'd like to pass you a switch configuration on the Cryo O<sub>2</sub> tanks and give you the reason. Right now, we'd like you to go to Heaters tank 1, Off; tank 2, Auto, which is the opposite of the way you've got them now. Over.
049:48:48|T|CMP|Okay. Is this O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>?
049:48:51|C|Kerwin|This is O<sub>2</sub>, and stand by for a minute and we'll have a - Excuse me. This is H<sub>2</sub>, Jack; it's H<sub>2</sub>.
049:49:22|T|CMP|... is Auto, ... 2 Off.
049:49:52|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. Do we have you back again?
049:49:55|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. We're getting you back, and I hope you copied my - my correction of my mistake. I'm talking about the H<sub>2</sub> Cryo Tanks. We'd like the tank 1 Heater to Off; tank 2 to Auto. Over.
049:50:09|T|CMP|Okay. We lost you again. Here's our heater configuration now. H<sub>2</sub> Heaters 1, Off; 2, Auto. Both O<sub>2</sub> Heaters are in Auto.
049:50:23|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's the configuration we want you in, and here's what we're thinking about. When we went to tank 1 Auto, tank 2 Off; we found that the heater cycle had a tank 1 pressure of about 233 psi, which is well above the caution and warning limit, and if we go to that configuration for sleep, we'll keep from getting Caution and Warning lights during the sleep cycle. Okay. In order to do that comfortably, we want to spend the rest of the day using more H<sub>2</sub> out of tank number 2, so as to get an unbalance in favor of tank 1, so at the end of the sleep cycle it'll all come out even. And that's why we have you in tank 1 Off, tank 2 Auto, now. We expect to get about a 3-percent unbalance over the next 10 hours; and prior to sleep, we'll call you to reverse the configuration again. Now the only disadvantage here is that, during the day, you will probably get a few Caution and Warnings, and we just figured it would be better to get them now than while you were sacked out. Over.
049:51:35|T|CDR|I'll buy that 100 percent.
049:51:37|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good deal. One other detail for you, Jack; G&amp;C tells us that the Optics jitter is very similar to what we had on Apollo 12. It's no problem, but when you're not using the Optics, we recommend that you turn the Optics Power switch to Off to guard against a possible degradation as the flight progresses. Over.
049:52:09|T|CMP|Okay. Will do.
049:52:23|C|Kerwin|Okay. Apollo 13, Houston. I have one more little update for you, and it's another update to the erasable memory onboard crew charts on page G/9-2. Over.
049:52:48|T|CDR|Houston, 13. We're ready to copy.
049:52:51|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. These are gyro compensation terms. They've already been uplinked, and we're just updating your onboard charts now. In column A: number 11, change from 77646 to 00114; number 12, change from 77332 to 77546; number 13, change from 76617 to 77201. Over.
049:53:43|T|CDR|The changes are as follows, and all in column A: number 12, the new change is 77546; number 11, the new change is 00114; and 13, the new change is 77201. Over.
049:54:01|C|Kerwin|Roger. Readback correct.
049:54:06|T|CMP|And, Joe, do you know - Are you going to try and let us spot the Bennett Comet on this next revolution there? Or do you want me to turn the Optics power off now?
049:54:17|C|Kerwin|Stand by one, Jack. Okay, Jack. We don't have confidence in those roll angles yet, so why don't you turn the Optics off, and we'll update you later.
049:54:32|T|CMP|Okay. Going off now.
049:54:34|C|Kerwin|Roger.
049:54:42|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 49 hours, 55 minutes now into the flight. Apollo 13 now 166,341 nautical miles [308,064 km] away from Earth, traveling at a velocity of 3,505 feet per second [1,068 m/s]. What you heard, was a relatively long exchange between capsule communicator Joe Kerwin and both Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert and spacecraft commander Jim Lovell. The Auto and Off heater positions referred to are the switch positions for the H<sub>2</sub> heater used to control redundant heaters in the two cryogenic hydrogen tanks. We are at 49 hours, 56 minutes into the flight and continuing to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
050:08:48|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston at 50 hours, 09 minutes into the flight. We presently show Apollo 13 at an altitude of 166,801 nautical miles [308,915 km], now traveling at a speed of 3,495 feet per second [1,065 m/s].
050:24:41|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 50 hours, 25 minutes now into the flight. Our display presently shows Apollo 13 at 167,355 nautical miles [309,941 km] away from Earth, and traveling at a speed of 3,483 feet per second [1,062 m/s]. We've had no voice communication with the crew for the past 15 or so minutes, however, we will standby and continue to keep the line open and alive. We're at 55 [sic] hours, 25 minutes; and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
050:26:48|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
050:26:53|T|CMP|Go ahead.
050:26:54|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
050:26:55|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jim. If you've got a couple of minutes now, I'd like to read up to you the change to the LM entry procedure that we'd like you to observe at 55 hours, and the rationale for it. Over.
050:27:14|T|CDR|Okay, Stand by.
050:27:17|C|Kerwin|Roger.
050:27:23|T|CDR|Go ahead, Joe.
050:27:25|C|Kerwin|Okay. Before you start copying, this procedure is - is basically simply to activate the supercritical helium pressure gauging so that you can read it. And the concern here is lest this supercritical helium pressure reach 1800 psi by 103 hours, at which point we'd be within a possibility of rupturing the burst disk when you activate the DPS. Now, based on the pressure at launch, and based on a nominal rise time of about 6&frac12; psi per hour between then and now, the pressure should read about 710 psi. Stand by, 13, until we get better comm.
050:28:43|T|CDR|Houston, you were cut out. Would you say again about the helium pressure.
050:28:49|C|Kerwin|Roger. Based on the prelaunch pressure in the SHe tank and the nominal rise time of about 6&frac12; psi per hour, the pressure should be about 710 at 55 hours. Are you reading? Over.
050:29:16|C|Kerwin|Jim, Houston. Did you read that last?
050:30:43|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. I'm on Omni C now. How do you read?
050:30:47|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. You're loud and clear now. INCO tells me he's having a little problem at Goldstone and wants me to stand by for a minute.
050:31:02|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read now, Joe? I'm going from Omni C to D now.
050:31:06|C|Kerwin|You're still loud and clear on - on D, Fred. Stand by one.
050:31:14|T|LMP|Okay. I'll put her back to Omni B if you all want to take command again?
050:31:49|T|LMP|And the last thing we heard, Joe, was that the Supercrit should be reading about 710 psi.
050:31:56|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's the last thing I passed up. And while we're waiting for INCO to decide here, let me continue. The deadband that is considered acceptable is between 660 and 770 psi. In other words, any rise time that'll give you one - a pressure between those two, will keep you below the critical pressure at 103 hours or so. So, we expect it to read in that - in that band and if it does, there will be no problem. If it reads between 770 and 800 psi, we will want you to check the pressure again at about 59 hours, and I'll get the detailed procedures in a minute. If the pressure is equal to or greater than 800 psi, we're going to have to go into some more detailed procedures; we're going to try to - to get PCM data on it, for one thing. We may have to have you sit there and stare at the gauge for a while to find out when it clicks up and get an accurate rise time on it, and then in extreme case, we are even thinking about a DPS burn, but we don't really think that will happen. Now, if you are ready to copy, what I have for you is a change or an addition to the LM Activation checklist between pages TLC-1 and TLC-2, which consists of seven steps, and if you can find a blank side to write it down on, I would like to pass it up. Over.
050:33:44|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read on Omni C, now?
050:33:48|C|Kerwin|Okay. You're loud and clear on Omni C. Stand by one while we get INCO synced up.
050:34:00|T|LMP|Okay. The rest of your update was that it's okay if it is anywhere between 660 and 770 psi. If it's above 770, you are going to ask us to consider going back in at 59 hours and either get PCM going or sit there and give you gauge reading changes on the basis of time. And you said something about an extreme measure; we may have to consider some sort of DPS maneuver.
050:34:45|C|Kerwin|That's correct, Fred. We don't have procedures for that yet, and we don't have any real expectation of getting into it. The procedure I'd like to read up to you now is simply the steps required to get the supercritical helium pressure reading, at 55 hours. Over.
050:35:10|T|LMP|Okay.
050:35:12|C|Kerwin|Okay. We're calling this TLC1-A, step 6, 'Transfer to LM power.'
050:35:23|T|LMP|Stand by one, Joe.
050:35:25|C|Kerwin|Okay.
050:35:37|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. He's ready to copy.
050:35:40|C|Kerwin|Okay. Step 6, 'Transfer to LM power (floodlights blank), Caution Warning Power Caution light On. Report GET to MCC. Panel 11, Circuit Breaker EPS Translunar Bus Tie, Closed. Circuit breaker panel 16, EPS Translunar Bus Tie, Closed. Circuit breaker panel 11, Lighting Utility, Closed. And activate utility lights.' -
050:36:33|T|LMP|Stand by, Joe.
050:36:35|C|Kerwin|Over. And, 13, Houston. Select Omni Bravo, please.
050:37:08|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. I've created a new page here called TLC-1A, item 6, Transfer to LM power and the usual check that the floodlight's blank and that I've got the Caution Warning Power light On; I get a GET from Jack, and I will pass that on down to you. Item 7, Circuit Breaker EPS Translunar Bus Tie, panels 11 and 16, Closed. Step 8, circuit breaker lighting and utility on panel 11, Closed, and turn on the utility lights. However, the lighting is such that I don't really need those. They are in stowage, right now, I guess, in the ISA, and I'll probably just leave them there.
050:37:48|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's optional. The way we had page TLC-1A written, that was all part of step 6. You haven't even gotten to step 7 yet. Step 7 is as follows.
050:38:11|C|Kerwin|Fred, Houston. Are you with me?
050:38:41|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston. Are you reading me now?
050:40:19|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston -
050:40:20|T|LMP|Okay. Houston, 13. How do you read?
050:40:22|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Loud and clear. What Omni you on now?
050:40:28|T|LMP|I'm going to stay Omni B, if you all want to take command back and you can let INCO jockey them around between B and D. And how many steps we got, so I know whether to write big or small here, Joe?
050:40:41|C|Kerwin|Okay. We got steps 6 through 12, but step 7 is the same size as 6, and 8 through 12 are short. They're only one line each.
050:40:53|T|LMP|Okay.
050:40:54|C|Kerwin|Okay. Step 7 follows: 'Circuit breaker panel 11, AC Bus B, Helium PQGS Propellant Display, Closed. Circuit breaker 11, AC Bus B, Numeric Lighting, Closed. Circuit breaker 11, AC Bus B, Bus Tie Inverter 1, Closed. Circuit breaker panel 11, EPS Inverter 1, Closed. Circuit breaker panel 16, Instrumentation Sig Sensor, Closed. Inverter 1' -
050:41:44|T|LMP|Hold on a minute, Joe.
050:41:45|C|Kerwin|Okay.
050:41:49|T|LMP|My shorthand is rather poor today.
050:42:13|T|LMP|Okay I'm now up to circuit breaker panel 11, Inverter 1, Closed.
050:42:20|C|Kerwin|Okay. Next was 'Circuit breaker panel 16, Instrumentation Sig Sensor, Closed. Then Inverter 1, Select. Then Helium Monitor to Supercrit Press. Report Supercrit Press to MCC.' Over.
050:44:31|T|LMP|Houston, 13. How do you read?
050:44:34|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. You're coming through. We still have some background noise. Do you want to read back step 7?
050:44:53|T|LMP|Hello, Houston; 13.
050:44:55|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
050:45:00|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. The last thing I got was Helium Monitor to Supercrit Pressure.
050:45:07|C|Kerwin|Okay. The last part of step 7 is, 'Report Supercrit Pressure to MCC,' and read back step 7.
050:45:30|T|LMP|Okay. Step 7. Circuit breaker panel 11, AC Bus B, Helium PQGS Display, Closed. Main - Circuit breaker panel 11, AC Bus B, Numeric Lighting, Closed. CD panel 11, AC Bus - Is that AC Bus B? Bus Tie Inverter 1, Closed?
050:45:51|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative.
050:45:53|T|LMP|And CB - CB EPS Inverter 1, panel 11, Closed. CB panel 16, Instrument Signal Sensor, Closed. Inverter 1, Select. Helium Monitor to Supercrit Pressure. Report pressure to MSFN.
050:46:09|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's correct. Now step 8 is, 'On MCC request, perform step 9.' In other words, you wait for us to decide what to do and that's according to the gauge we've already given you. And step 9, I'll give you now, is 'Helium Monitor to Off, Inverter to Off.' Over.
050:46:45|T|LMP|Okay. Step 8 says, 'Sit in an MCC hold.' Step 9 says, 'On MCC's words, Helium Monitor Off, Inverter Off.'
050:47:00|C|Kerwin|Roger. That's correct. Step 10 is, 'Configure circuit breaker panels per Activation 3 and 4.'
050:47:24|T|LMP|Okay. Configure - step 10, 'Configure circuit breakers per Activation pages 3 and 4.'
050:47:31|C|Kerwin|Roger. That's correct. Step 11 is, 'Deactivate the utility lights if you activated them,' and step 12 which is the last one is, 'Transfer to CSM power, usual observations, and report time to MCC.'
050:48:20|T|LMP|Okay. Step 11, 'Deactivate utility lights.' 12, 'Transfer to CSM power and note the usual observations and report the GET.'
050:48:31|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's it. And, of course, Houston will be requesting you to go to step 9 if the pressure is less than 770. If the pressure is between 770 and 800, we will be asking you to do the following, if you're ready to copy.
050:48:59|T|LMP|Stand by. I've got to find some more blank paper.
050:49:01|C|Kerwin|Yes. This is going to be page TLC-3, but it's very short.
050:49:25|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead with TLC-3.
050:49:31|C|Kerwin|Okay. Stand by 10 seconds, Fred.
050:50:20|C|Kerwin|Fred, Houston.
050:50:25|T|LMP|All right. Go ahead.
050:50:26|C|Kerwin|Roger. We'll hold off on that. It was a short three-step procedure which said, 'Repeat activation pages 1, 1A, and 2,' but there was another step in it that nobody understands. So, essentially what we'd recommend in that case would be that you would repeat the procedure that we just passed up for reading the Supercrit pressure. If we need to, we'll clarify it later on. And that's all we've got.
050:50:56|T|LMP|Okay.
050:50:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston at 50 hours, 51 minutes now into the flight. We experienced some communications difficulties during that extended conversation. However, that was Joe Kerwin adding to the LM activation procedures for the 55-hour time in the Flight Plan giving steps required to get readings of the supercritical helium pressure in the LM after Jim Lovell and Fred Haise go inside Aquarius. Fred Haise copied that report for Apollo 13. We now show on our displays, Apollo 13 at 168,262 nautical miles [311,621 km] out from Earth and slowing down; traveling at a velocity now of 3,463 feet per second [1,056 m/s]. Continuing to monitor at 50 hours, 52 minutes; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
050:57:38|T|CDR|Houston, 13.
050:57:44|C|Kerwin|13, Houston. Go ahead.
050:57:49|T|CDR|Okay. One thing, Joe; I just want to double check again. All the stuff that normally was going to start at 57 hours, which the first item was pressurize CSM to 5.7 psia, we're going to move that up to 54 now, so we have our LM entry which was nominally at 58 at 55. Is that correct?
050:58:10|C|Kerwin|That's correct, Jim.
050:58:12|T|CDR|Okay.
051:03:16|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 51 hours, 3 minutes now into the flight. Apollo 13 presently shows an altitude of 168,651 nautical miles [312,342 km] relative to Earth, and traveling at a velocity of 3,455 feet per second [1,053 m/s]. Among those presently at the capsule communicator's console here in Mission Control is Command Module Pilot, Ken Mattingly. We're at 51 hours, 4 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
051:07:02|C|Kerwin|Apollo 13, Houston.
051:07:07|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
051:07:08|C|Kerwin|Roger, 13. Because of the O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 quantity sensor drop out, EECOM wants to keep a little closer track of the cryo quantities, and he's going to be asking you to stir all the cryo tanks at slightly more frequent intervals than had been planned, and the first time is now, and we will be calling you probably every 5 or 6 hours, except during sleep period and high activity periods. We'd like you to do it now. Over.
051:07:44|T|CDR|Okay. We'll start a cryo stir now.
051:07:46|C|Kerwin|Thank you.
051:07:59|C|Kerwin|And, 13, Houston. For your information, a normal 1-minute or so stir will be fine.
051:17:04|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 51 hours, 17 minutes into the flight. We presently show Apollo 13 at a distance of 169,111 nautical miles [313,194 km] out and travelling at a speed of 3,445 feet per second [1,050 m/s]. In the Mission Control Center we are having a change in capsule communicators. Vance Brand has reported in, taking the place of Joe Kerwin. We are at 51 hours, 18 minutes now; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
051:29:27|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 51 hours, 29 minutes now in the flight. Apollo 13 now 169,526 nautical miles [313,962 km] in altitude and traveling at a velocity of 3,436 feet per second [1,047 m/s]. We've had no communication with the crew of Apollo 13 for about the last 30 minutes. It's very possible that they have also stepped ahead the eat period in their Flight Plan. We'll stand by however and continue to monitor and at 51 hours, 30 minutes into the flight; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
052:06:31|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 52 hours, 7 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Our digital display presently shows the Apollo 13 spacecraft at an altitude of 170,752 nautical miles [316,233 km], continuing to slow down now at a speed of 3,410 feet per second [1,039 m/s]. A relatively quiet period here on the second shift that the White Flight Control Team has pulled at this point in time. Most of the flight controllers talking things over with their respective backrooms. We have not had contact with the crew for almost an hour. We'll stand by and continue to monitor at 52 hours, 7 minutes into the flight. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
052:07:42|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
052:07:48|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
052:07:50|C|Brand|Jim, just an advisory; expect a Caution and Warning on H<sub>2</sub> tank 1 pretty quick. No problems; just warning you about it.
052:08:04|T|CDR|Okay. A cryo pressure light on H<sub>2</sub> tank 1 coming on shortly, huh?
052:08:08|C|Brand|Right.
052:08:11|T|CDR|Okay. Well, you're pretty close. It just came on.
052:08:20|C|Brand|Any other predictions you'd like?
052:08:26|T|CDR|Well, there's - I guess there's all sorts. Could you go to the horse races with me?
052:08:32|C|Brand|I'm sorry; you were garbled. Say again?
052:08:37|T|CDR|I said I'd like to invite you to the horse races with me.
052:08:41|C|Brand|Right. We'll - We'll send EECOM.
052:08:50|P|PAO|That was Vance Brand with a caution and warning light advisory timed almost to the second. Jim Lovell responded from the spacecraft. We're at 52 hours and 9 minutes into the flight and the show of Apollo 13 at 170,831 nautical miles [316,379 km] above the Earth, travelling at a speed of 3,408 feet per second [1,039 m/s]. Gene Kranz just spoke to the EECOM and said that's pretty lucky, then he said, 'Oh, correction, that's pretty skilful.' We are at 52 hours, 10 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
052:16:55|T|LMP|Well, it's time for a little grits again here, Vance.
052:17:01|C|Brand|Understand. Some grits, huh? Chow. Bon apetit.
052:17:24|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. That was Fred Haise, a native of Mississippi, saying it's time for some grits in here now. Obviously his conversion of, for describing it's mealtime. We're at 52 hours, 18 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
052:21:30|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 52 hours, 23 minutes now into the mission. Apollo 13 is presently 171,246 nautical miles [317,148 km] away from Earth. Its present velocity reads 3,399 feet per second [1,036 m/s]. Continuing to monitor; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
052:36:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 52 hours, 36 minutes into the flight of Apollo 13. The Apollo 13 spacecraft now shows a distance of 171,726 nautical miles [318,036 km] away from Earth traveling at a speed of 3,389 feet per second [1,033 m/s]. We've just received a further update from the Flight Dynamics Officer with regard to predicted time and coordinates for the S-IVB impact. We now read a time of impact of 77 hours, 56 minutes, 45 seconds with coordinates now displayed here in Mission Control of 2 degrees, 33 minutes south; 18 degrees, 18 minutes west. We're at 52 hours, 37 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
052:45:20|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
052:45:25|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
052:45:27|C|Brand|Roger. Just expect that same Caution and Warning to come on again. And you want us to keep warning you of that thing?
052:45:43|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
052:45:47|C|Brand|Roger, Jim. Just expect a Caution and Warning to come on the same as it did about an hour ago.
052:46:04|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston. We've lost you ...
052:46:08|C|Brand|Roger. How are you reading me now, Jim?
052:46:33|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 13.
052:46:36|C|Brand|13, Houston. How do you read now?
052:46:41|T|CDR|Okay. Read you good now. Seems like we've had a little trouble with the comm today.
052:46:46|C|Brand|Yes. I guess it's partly because you are further out. We just wanted to tell you that you were going to get that Caution Warning that you just got.
052:46:58|T|CDR|Right. We just got.
052:47:00|C|Brand|And I won't bother you with those calls anymore, unless you especially want them.
052:47:10|T|CDR|That's okay, Vance. You don't have to call us about that, unless it's something serious.
052:47:14|C|Brand|Okay.
052:47:32|T|LMP|We just ate a can of ham salad and that was an experience.
052:47:40|C|Brand|Roger. Copy.
052:47:49|T|LMP|It's really kind of like eating on the sly. Chasing it around.
052:48:02|C|Brand|Right. Copy.
052:48:18|T|LMP|But good.
052:48:25|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 52 hours, 48 minutes into the flight. Spacecraft Apollo 13 is now at an altitude of 172,125 nautical miles [318,775 km] and going at a speed of 3,381 feet per second [1,031 m/s]. That last conversation exchange we heard from both Jim Lovell and later describing ham salad sandwich was Fred Haise. We're at 52 hours, 49 minutes into the flight and continuing to monitor; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
053:08:07|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 53 hours, 8 minutes into the mission. We now show Apollo 13 at a distance of 172,771 nautical miles [319,972 km] and traveling at a rate of speed of 3,367 feet per second [1,026 m/s]. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
053:19:28|T|CDR|Alright.
053:19:31|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 13.
053:19:40|C|Brand|13, Houston. Go ahead.
053:19:45|T|CDR|Right, we're not doing anything right now, Vance, we're just getting curious, we could start the LM entry procedures, and get everything squared away, and then when the TV comes up at 55 hours, we can just use it for the TV, and we wouldn't be worrying about checking out the SHe tank pressures and everything like that.
053:20:07|C|Brand|Okay, let us mull that one a minute here, and I'll get right back with you.
053:20:14|T|CDR|Okay.
053:21:36|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 53 hours, 21 minutes into the flight. Apollo 13 now at a distance of 173,207 nautical miles [320,779 km], and proceeding at a speed of 3,358 feet per second [1,024 m/s]. That last report came to us from the spacecraft Commander Jim Lovell. There is a discussion here in the Control Center now as to what our response may be. We're at 53 hours, 22 minutes; and continuing to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
053:23:35|T|CDR|Also, Houston, Apollo 13. We'd like to move up the waste water dump and maybe the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge a little bit early, if we could.
053:23:51|C|Brand|Okay, stand by.
053:26:30|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
053:26:35|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
053:26:37|C|Brand|Jim, you're clear to go on into the LM, and just advise though that the TV time is still fixed at 55 hours, and - so we'll be standing by to support your entry and we'll get back with you on a minute - in a minute on the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and the waste water dump.
053:26:59|T|CDR|Okay. Sounds good.
053:27:02|C|Brand|And also request your LM/CM Delta-P which was on the Flight Plan for 53 hours. What did you vent it down to? Over.
053:27:16|T|CDR|We have 1.7 now. We vented it down to that figure.
053:27:20|C|Brand|Okay, you vented down to 1.7, and what did it start at?
053:27:28|T|CDR|It was about 1.1, Vance.
053:27:31|C|Brand|Roger, copy.
053:27:37|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; 53 hours, 28 minutes. There you've heard the response from CapCom Vance Brand clearing the Apollo 13 commander and Lunar Module Pilot for going into the LM about an hour earlier than had previously been planned. However, the television transmission time will remain unchanged at 55 hours Ground Elapsed Time. We presently show Apollo 13 at an altitude of 173,422 nautical miles [321,177 km] and at a velocity of 3,354 feet per second [1,022 m/s]. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
053:34:32|T|LMP|Houston, 13.
053:34:35|C|Brand|Go ahead, 13.
053:34:40|T|LMP|What do you read for suit pressure down there?
053:34:53|C|Brand|We're reading 4.3, Fred.
053:34:59|T|LMP|Okay.
053:35:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. So we have Jim Lovell and Fred Haise cleared to go inside Aquarius a bit earlier and they're proceeding in that direction now. Although Jim Lovell is presently the only astronaut to have taken a second trip atop the Saturn V and is the first of his group to make a second journey to the Moon, this evening will mark his first step inside the Lunar Module inflight. The Apollo 8 crew circled the Moon with the Command and Service Modules only. We'll standby and continue to monitor at 53 hours, 36 minutes into the flight.
053:38:58|T|CDR|Houston, 13.
053:39:03|C|Brand|Go ahead, Apollo 13.
053:39:07|T|CDR|We'd like another confirmation, when we closed the tunnel vent valve back to LM/CM Delta-P, we were reading about 1.7 - 1.75, and it slowly went up now to about - oh, I'd say a little less than 2.2. Seems to be holding there - Is there a lag in the gauging system?
053:39:33|C|Brand|Okay. We'll - we'll ask that question. Stand by.
053:40:58|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
053:42:07|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
053:42:24|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
053:42:30|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
053:42:32|C|Brand|Okay, to answer your question, Jim, that increase in pressure is normal, because it was just tracking an increase in cabin pressure.
053:42:46|T|CDR|Okay. Okay.
053:42:57|T|CDR|We're not thinking today.
053:43:20|C|Brand|And, 13, from Houston, it's okay with us if you want to move the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and the water dump up to this time. Over.
053:43:33|T|CDR|Okay. We'll work it in shortly. Thank you.
053:43:36|C|Brand|Right.
053:43:47|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 53 hours, 44 minutes into the mission. Apollo 13 at the present time 173,934 nautical miles [322,126 km] out from Earth and now going at a speed of 3,343 feet per second [1,019 m/s]. We're at 53 hours, 44 minutes and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
053:45:11|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
053:45:16|T|CDR|Go ahead.
053:45:17|C|Brand|Jim, recommend you stay in the PTC until we stop it for the TV at 55 hours, in case you were thinking of -
053:45:24|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
053:45:26|C|Brand|Roger. Recommend you continue PTC until 55 hours. Over.
053:45:54|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. EECOM confirmed to Flight Director Gene Kranz the fuel cells are being purged and water dump being accomplished at this time.
053:46:05|T|CDR|You were calling, Houston?
053:46:12|C|Brand|That's affirmed, Jim. How do you read now?
053:46:17|T|CDR|Okay. We read you loud and clear.
053:46:19|C|Brand|Okay. The only comment that we just made was that, in case you were thinking of stopping PTC, there's no need to stop it until 55 GET when TV starts.
053:46:34|T|CDR|Right. We'll stop it when we're setting up our TV.
053:46:37|C|Brand|Roger.
053:47:57|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. 53 hours, 48 minutes. EECOM confirms to Flight Director Gene Kranz that the cabin pressures are being equalized now. We presently show Apollo 13 at an altitude of 174,070 nautical miles [322,378 km] and traveling at a speed of 3,340 feet per second [1,018 m/s]. We're at 53 hours, 48 minutes; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
053:50:50|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. 53 hours, 51 minutes. EECOM reports the cabin pressures have leveled off now, reading 4.7 - 4.8. We now show Apollo 13 at 174,160 nautical miles [322,544 km] away and going at a speed of 3,338 feet per second [1,017 m/s]. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
053:54:34|T|CMP|Okay, Houston, the waste water dump and O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge are complete.
053:54:41|C|Young|Houston. Roger.
053:54:52|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 53 hours 55 minutes. That was Back-up Commander for Apollo 13, John Young, returning that call from the spacecraft. Capsule communicator Vance Brand has left his console for a brief period of time to attend a meeting on the LM activation procedures and the monitoring of the super critical helium tank readings. We're at 53 hours 55 minutes and now show Apollo 13 at 174,309 nautical miles and traveling at a rate of speed of 3,500 correction 3,335 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
054:05:54|T|CMP|Okay, Houston, the LM/CM Delta-P is constant. We're going to go ahead with hatch removal.
054:06:04|C|Young|Houston. Roger.
054:06:10|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. That was Fred Haise telling Houston that they're ready to proceed with hatch opening.
054:06:16|T|LMP|Is that you, Jack?
054:06:20|C|Young|No, this is Jack's replacement.
054:06:32|P|PAO|Apollo 13 apparently mystified for the moment about John Young's voice. We show 13 at an altitude of 174,664 nautical miles [323,478 km] with a velocity of 3,328 feet per second [1,014 m/s]. We're now at 54 hours, 7 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
054:24:15|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; 13.
054:24:18|C|Young|Houston, go ahead.
054:24:25|C|Young|Go ahead, 13.
054:24:46|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 13.
054:24:49|C|Young|This is Houston. Go ahead, 13.
054:25:18|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; Apollo 13.
054:25:22|C|Young|Roger. Go ahead, 13.
054:25:28|T|CMP|Okay. The LMP has entered the LM.
054:25:31|C|Young|Roger.
054:25:36|P|PAO|Apollo -
054:25:37|T|CMP|Is that Big John?
054:25:39|C|Young|It sure is. How're you doing?
054:25:43|T|CMP|Fine.
054:25:44|C|Young|Yes, you're doing great, man.
054:25:49|T|CMP|Thank you. I had a good CDR.
054:25:54|C|Young|You're doing it on your own now.
054:26:01|T|LMP|Yes, it feels like I'm back at home, again, John, down in here.
054:26:04|T|CMP|I hope you did a good job, John.
054:26:06|C|Young|Roger.
054:26:09|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 54 hours, 26 minutes into the flight. That was Jack Swigert reporting that Fred Haise is now inside the Lunar Module. And carrying on a brief discussion with his former spacecraft Commander - his backup Commander - for this mission, John Young. We now show Apollo 13 at an altitude of 175,307 nautical miles [324,669 km].
054:26:40|T|CMP|Okay, Houston, we want to take the FM and bring up TV here for our own use. Then we'll go to Transmit 1 - at 55 hours.
054:26:58|C|Lousma|Roger, 13.
054:27:08|P|PAO|Apollo 13 now traveling at a speed of 3,314 feet per second [1,010 m/s]. We're at 54 hours, 27 minutes now into the flight, and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
054:42:41|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 54 hours, 42 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Apollo 13 now shows an altitude of 175,826 nautical miles [325,630 km] and its speed reads 3,304 feet per second [1,007 m/s]. Network has been advised by Goldstone that network does now have the capability of receiving television at any time. We will stand by in the event we should receive an early television transmission. At this point we do not expect to receive such, but we will stand by at 54 hours, 43 minutes into the flight. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
054:46:28|T|CMP|Okay, Houston, we've transferred to LM power; the time was 54 hours, 46 minutes, 15 seconds.
054:46:40|C|Lousma|Roger, Jack. Transfer to LM power. Thank you.
054:46:47|T|LMP|And the docking-tunnel index, Jack, was minus 2 degrees.
054:46:54|C|Lousma|Say again, Fred, you're coming in with a lot of background noise.
054:47:00|T|LMP|Okay. The docking-tunnel index mark was minus 2 degrees.
054:47:05|C|Lousma|Roger. Minus 2 degrees.
054:49:17|T|LMP|Okay. Jack, how do you read?
054:49:29|C|Lousma|Fred, Houston is reading you loud and clear.
054:49:34|T|LMP|Okay. I've got up through step 7 now, and I'm not getting much of a light in the helium indicator here. Why don't I review for you how we've proceeded, and you look at the procedure you gave me, and see if we've missed anything.
054:49:53|C|Lousma|Roger. Go ahead.
054:49:57|T|LMP|Okay. We transferred to LM power and that looked okay. I'm staring at a Caution and Warning Power light, and all the red flags; and we got both X Lunar Bus Tie breakers, In. The Utility Lighting breaker is In; then AC Bus B Helium PQS Display; the AC Bus B Numeric Lighting, and AC Bus B Inverter 1 is - Bus Tie is Closed. Then I closed the Inverter 1 breaker, and I've selected, on panel 16, and the Signal Consensor [sic] breaker is in; I've selected Inverter 1 and put the Helium Monitor switch to Supercrit and I have no lights.
054:51:06|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred, let us take a look at it.
054:51:07|T|LMP|I was wondering, do we need an A - do we need, possibly, in the - one of the Anun/Dock/Component breakers in?
054:51:18|C|Lousma|Stand by one.
054:51:33|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. Hold the phone. I forgot the rheostat was cranked all the way down on the Anun/Num and it's showing 720, which looks like a pretty good - pretty good number.
054:51:47|C|Lousma|Roger. We copy 720. Thank you, Fred -
054:51:49|T|LMP|Flashed to 7 - Okay, and it just flickered down to 710. It's kind of flickering between 710 and 720.
054:52:00|C|Lousma|Roger. 710 to 720.
054:52:16|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. Those are good numbers, and we're not going to have to crank up the TM. That's the number we were looking for.
054:52:26|T|LMP|Very good. Okay. Do you want me to back out of this in reverse at least as far as getting this part of it powered down?
054:52:36|C|Lousma|Stand by one.
054:52:54|P|PAO|You've heard that report from Fred Haise.
054:52:56|C|Lousma|Fred, this is Houston. Go ahead and back out of this little test and proceed.
054:53:04|T|LMP|Roger.
054:53:06|P|PAO|Our supercritical helium pressure rating was 720 pounds per square inch. A very desirable number. We're at 54 hours, 53 minutes now into the flight. Apollo 13 at 176,171 nautical miles [326,269 km] away from Earth. We're standing by now for receipt of television.
054:55:07|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 54 hours, 55 minutes. We repeat that earlier report from LM pilot Fred Haise. He read his supercritical helium pressure at 720 pounds per square inch. Well under the 770 pounds per square inch mark earlier identified as a point for further scrutinization.
054:55:40|P|PAO|We now show 13 traveling at 3,296 feet per second [1,005 m/s] and at an altitude of 176,240 nautical miles [326,396 km].
054:57:06|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston at 54 hours, 57 minutes. Jack Lousma is now filling the position of capsule communicator in the Mission Control Center. That was Jack who received that last report from Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise. Standing by; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
054:59:01|T|CMP|Okay. We're back on CSM power. The time was 54 hours, 58 minutes, 50 seconds.
054:59:10|C|Lousma|Roger, Jack. 54:58:50. Thank you.
054:59:26|T|CMP|Okay, Houston, we'll try to pick you up on the High Gain.
054:59:32|C|Lousma|Roger.
054:59:40|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. Standing by now for receipt of television transmission.
055:00:08|C|Lousma|And, 13, we're ready on the TV when you are.
055:00:19|T|CDR|This is 13. Say again, Houston.
055:00:23|C|Lousma|13, we're ready on the TV when you are. Any time.
055:00:28|T|CDR|Okay, sounds good. With you in a minute, we're just cranking up High Gain now.
055:01:20|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. How do you read us in the High Gain?
055:01:23|C|Lousma|We're hearing you 5 square, Jim, how me?
055:01:28|T|CDR|Okay. You're coming through okay.
055:01:40|C|Lousma|As you were on that, Jim. We don't have you on High Gain yet. We're still looking at you.
055:02:27|C|Lousma|13, Houston. In this attitude, we'd suggest pitch 5, yaw 237 on the High Gain. Over.
055:02:39|T|CDR|Pitch 5, yaw 237. Roger.
055:05:05|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 55 hours, 05 minutes. Continuing to stand by for television transmission.
055:05:12|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Can you - can you read the High Gain now?
055:05:24|C|Lousma|Affirmative, Jack. We've got you on a High Gain and it appears to us that we're in Wide beam - Wide beam width.
055:05:32|T|CMP|Yes. We can't get it to come down to Narrow. We tried to switch to Auto Track or Reacq, and it - yaw drives around from 270 to 0. And pitch goes from about 6 degrees around to 90. I'm trying - we're fitting it manual now at the angles that you gave us, and I'll try and get you in Medium and Narrow beam width tweaking it up manually here.
055:06:06|C|Lousma|Roger, Jack. Meanwhile, we'll look at the situation you describe there.
055:06:13|T|CMP|Okay. And it does it on both sets of servo electronic power.
055:07:00|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 55 hours, 07 minutes. We now show Apollo 13 at 176,598 nautical miles [327,059 km].
055:07:15|T|CMP|Jack, what it looks like is that, when we hit 239 degrees at this attitude, it hit some sort of scan limit or something and drops off.
055:07:33|C|Lousma|Roger, Jack; thank you.
055:07:37|T|CMP|Okay, I'm trying you in Wide or Medium beam width now.
055:07:54|T|CMP|Can you pick up the TV in this condition here at all?
055:08:07|C|Lousma|Negative, Jack. We'll have to have the Narrow beam width.
055:08:14|T|CMP|Okay. Can you give us, maybe, a slight maneuver?
055:09:09|C|Lousma|Jack, we'd like you to check two High Gain circuit breakers down in panel 25. Check your High Gain group 2 and your High Gain in the flight bus. Over.
055:09:19|T|CMP|Okay. Okay, Jack, they're both In.
055:09:27|C|Lousma|Roger.
055:10:43|C|Lousma|13, we've got an attitude suggestion for you. We suggest that you go to roll 285 and try pitch 90 and yaw 0. Over.
055:10:57|T|CMP|Okay.
055:14:00|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; Apollo 13. I think we've got High Gain locked up now. Do you concur?
055:14:07|C|Lousma|We confirm that, Jim, we've got you locked up on the High Gain and narrow beam.
055:14:13|T|CDR|Okay, sounds good. We'll get the TV started right away.
055:14:16|C|Lousma|Roger.
055:14:27|P|PAO|That was spacecraft Commander Jim Lovell confirming that they had the High Gain narrow beam locked up.
055:14:36|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We'd like to disable Quads C and D; use Alpha and Bravo. Over.
055:14:43|P|PAO|We're now receiving a transmission, television transmission.
055:14:44|T|CMP|Okay -
055:14:45|T|CDR|- Disable quads C and D. Roger.
055:14:56|C|Lousma|Okay, 13. We've got Freddo on TV.
055:15:04|T|CDR|Roger, Houston. What we plan to do for you today is start out in the space ship - er, Odyssey, and take you on through from Odyssey in through the tunnel into Aquarius. And show you a little bit of the landing vehicle, and your TV operator is now resting on the center couch, looking at Fred Haise, whose head is now just about at the beginning of the tunnel, and his back is against the Lower Equipment Bay optical area. And Fred will now transport himself into the tunnel, and into the spaceship Aquarius.
055:15:48|T|LMP|You know one thing I noted, Jack, when I first came across here, that starting upright in the Command Module and heading down in Aquarius, there's a little bit of an orientation change that, even though I'd been through it once in the water tank, it still pretty unusual. I find myself, now, standing with my head on the floor when I get down inside the LM.
055:16:25|C|Lousma|That's a great picture, Jim. You got the light just right.
055:16:40|T|LMP|And one of the nice things, Jack, particularly for a novice like myself, is the - the ease of moving around in here. It's, of course, as you know from working in the Command Module Simulator, it's really quite a boon to have zero gravity as an aid. Because you get - pretty confining, really, at one g, to move around very much in there, and it's quite easy in this environment. The LM, as you can see, it looked pretty clean, I found a couple of loose washers about it and the - a little plastic cap off the sequence camera had come loose and I found it lodged over by the ED panel. Okay. Right under Jim, now, he's actually standing on a - what looks to be a can here. And, for the sake of all the people back there, housed inside this can is the - the LM ascent engine where, hopefully, you can see my hand resting on top of right now - the engine that we use to get off of the Moon. Immediately adjacent to the engine cover here, I have my hand on a white box now, which has been shown before. This happens to be Jim's PLSS, or the backpack which'll supply oxygen and water for cooling while on the lunar surface. This device we hope to make use of for - a planned 4 hours and possibly up to as much as 5 hours. Right - right behind the PLSS, a couple of little square packages I now have my hand on here, one here and one right below, are our OPSs, which are, in essence, the emergency oxygen supplies, which are good for some 40 to 45 minutes. These are - when we get ready to mount up and head outside, will be placed up on top of the PLSS.
055:19:24|T|LMP|The second backpack is mounted down on the LM floor, I hope, positioned right between the two of us. I have my hand on it at this time.
055:19:41|C|Lousma|Roger, Fred. We see it. The picture's coming through real good, and your description is good. We see Jim's got the camera oriented the way we like to look at it. So, keep talking.
055:20:05|T|LMP|Okay. I guess everybody has pretty much envisioned the space program as being all a lot of exotic electronics, and, certainly, a lot of it is. But I thought I'd bring out a couple of items here in conjunction with the PLSS. After the first EVA, you get a very accurate measurement of the amount of water that's left in the PLSSs. We're going to make use of this bag I'm showing now to collect the remaining water out of the PLSS and see just how much we really did have left, and hopefully, on future missions, to be able to extend safely the allowable time on these units even a little further. And, my other hand, I have the mechanism by which we determine just how much water we really have in this bag. And I guess this - an apt description for this device would be a fish scale. And you can see I'm weighing myself right now, and it says I weigh actually less than zero right now. Guess its calibration isn't too good.
055:21:22|C|Lousma|That'll be the day.
055:21:29|T|LMP|I think even you'd weigh zero here, Jack.
055:21:38|C|Lousma|Touché .
055:21:50|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. We now show 13 at 175,000 nautical miles [324,100 km] in altitude.
055:22:14|T|CDR|Houston, this is Jim. Since Fred's been in the Lunar Module, and since he's the Lunar Module Pilot, this is the first time that he's felt that he's been right-side up.
055:22:34|C|Lousma|Roger, Jim.
055:22:37|T|CDR|I might tell you that we're looking at right now, that round bag that's just behind Fred holds our vacuum hose; and when we get back inside the LM, we'll hook the vacuum off our suits, and it's resting or it's attached to the hatch which will - we will open to go on to the lunar surface, and, of course, to come back in. The hatch which we have come to now is a round hatch, which is our docking hatch between the - between Odyssey and Aquarius.
055:23:11|C|Lousma|Roger, and we see Fred looking in the vacuum cleaner there now.
055:23:22|T|LMP|Okay, what I have out now, Jack, is LEVA, which has also been shown before. It's a head garment for wearing out on the surface, and I - I'm bringing Jim's out here to show a couple of mods [modifications]. One problem before is that the cast of characters down on the surface haven't been able to be distinguished apart very well. So, not only Jim's suit has some red stripes on it, but as you can see his LEVA also has a - a red stripe.
055:24:27|T|LMP|And now you can see one other mod here too, Jack, which I hadn't really seen myself before. I guess on 12, Pete and Al had commented about the - commented about having trouble with sunlight in the eyes, so on our LEVAs they put on a new center section which you can pull down and use sort of like a baseball cap.
055:24:56|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. Who fixed up our LEVAs?
055:25:12|T|LMP|How's the detail on this one, Jack?
055:25:15|C|Lousma|Say again, Fred.
055:25:19|T|LMP|Can you see any detail in this picture now, or am I blocking out too much of the sunlight?
055:25:26|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. We've got a good picture of the LEVA there, and it's coming through loud and clear.
055:25:35|T|LMP|Okay.
055:25:54|T|CDR|Okay, Jack, while Fred is putting away my helmet, you are looking over into Fred's station now. How's this picture, is it okay before - or do I have to adjust it?
055:26:06|C|Lousma|We have a hunch that the setting might be in Peak but we recommend Average on the ALC if you haven't got it there already.
055:26:16|T|CDR|We're in Average, Jack.
055:26:18|C|Lousma|Okay. And we're getting a good picture of the LMP side with the DEDA over there.
055:26:29|T|CMP|Hey, Jack, one question on the Command Module here. Do I - I have the DAP right now wide deadband. Do you want me to begin setting up narrow deadband and nulling the rates to start PTC again.
055:26:47|C|Lousma|Stand by, Jack.
055:27:31|T|LMP|What I'm fishing out now, Jack, is another new piece of hardware that we are taking along this time as a result of some comments made on the Apollo 12 flight.
055:27:52|T|CDR|What Fred is opening up - is a drink bag that we place inside of our neckring that will allow us to drink while we are on the lunar surface. They - Pete and Al - did not have that on Apollo 12 and they, consequently, got very thirsty. But we hope to alleviate that situation by having our own little bag of water which, with very little effort, we can have a sip or two while we are looking around and doing our geology work.
055:28:33|T|LMP|So if you hear any funny noises, it is just probably the drink bag.
055:28:50|T|CDR|Fred, the bag's empty.
055:29:16|T|CDR|Fred is now looking through our optical device. It's an instrument in which to align our platform, and Fred is now looking into it just to see what kind of an outside picture he might be able to get. We might be able to use a TV camera to look through our optical instrument to the outside of the Command Module. A few minutes ago while we first came in, we did manage to look to the outside of the side hatch of the Command Module through our optical instrument. Stand by. We'll try to see what we can do here.
055:29:49|C|Lousma|Roger, Jim. Break, Jack, we'd like you to stay in the deadband you are now in, and we'll make a change when the TV is over. Another thing we would like you to do is check your pitch and yaw on your High Gain meter so we can compare it with what we're seeing down here.
055:30:11|T|CMP|Okay, it's showing about - say 28 degrees and 267.
055:30:18|C|Lousma|20 and 267.
055:30:21|T|CMP|28 - 28 and 267.
055:30:45|T|LMP|Okay, Jack, Have you got that picture now?
055:30:49|C|Lousma|Fred, about one-quarter of our screen is lighted, and it's impossible to determine what you are looking at right now. Maybe you could give us a little verbal description.
055:31:02|T|LMP|Okay. It's looking through the AOT in position 4, right rear. And we're looking back toward the - over the side hatch at the aft side of the service module.
055:31:28|T|LMP|Okay. Is - is it too dark a picture, Jack? You think the f-stop open may help?
055:31:34|C|Lousma|No, Fred, it's got to be centered up a little bit. That's primarily what you have to do.
055:31:43|T|CDR|Jack, we can't center it up any more, because the side hatch is only one part of the AOT. The rest of that blackness you see is really space.
055:32:11|T|LMP|Okay. We'll try another one, and it's a little better centered. In fact, the only other one we have that shows the whole picture. We're in the forward detent of the AOT now, position 2, and you should be seeing something familiar like a radar antenna.
055:32:41|C|Lousma|Okay, we see you moving the camera up to the AOT lens, and we got a real good picture now.
055:33:03|T|CDR|And -
055:33:23|T|LMP|Okay, Jack, I'm looking out the right window now, and not too far off in the distance now, you can see the objective, and I'll zoom in on it here a little and see if it brings it in better.
055:33:57|T|LMP|And it's actually beginning to look a little bigger now. You can see quite distinctly some of the features with the naked eye. And so far, I guess I have to even agree with Jim that it's still looking pretty gray with white spots.
055:34:39|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. We're getting a good picture of your destination there.
055:35:04|T|CDR|Jack, you've been looking at the - at Fred's workshop now, and you can see the abort guidance computer. And over there on the - tucked away in his armrest, is our activation checklist, which we'll be using very shortly. Up on the top of the window, we have our camera already mounted ready for photographing the descent. And now Fred's engaged in his favorite pastime, I found out on this flight so far.
055:35:47|C|Lousma|He's not in the food locker, is he?
055:35:52|T|CDR|That's his second favorite pastime. He's rigging his hammock for sleep on the lunar surface now to find out - to see what it's going to be like.
055:36:03|C|Lousma|Roger. Sleeping and then eating.
055:36:29|T|LMP|It's kind of difficult here, Jack, getting into a hammock in zero g. I'm not sure if I keep floating away from it or it keeps moving away from me.
055:36:50|T|CDR|If you notice a few things floating around, we found just about one or two washers occasionally.
055:36:57|T|LMP|And for the benefit of those that may wonder where Jim sleeps. Be a little difficult to rig his hammock in here right now with the hatch open, but his runs laterally in this direction, fore-aft. So he has the upper berth and I get the lower berth.
055:37:34|T|CDR|And now while Fred's taking his hammock down and restowing it, I might give you some idea of what sort of confusion of attitudes since there is no up or down, and I'm situated on top of the ascent engine just at the entrance to the tunnel. I'll reverse the camera 180 degrees and go from Fred, look through the tunnel again back at Odyssey, and we might pick up part of Jack.
055:38:25|C|Lousma|There he is. We see him.
055:38:29|P|PAO|That's Jim Lovell now pointing the camera at Jack Swigert in Odyssey. We're at 55 hours, 38 minutes into the flight of Apollo 13.
055:38:56|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. For the benefit of the television viewers, we've just about completed our little inspection of Aquarius, and now we're proceeding through the hatchy-gap into the tunnel and going back toward the Odyssey.
055:39:22|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. It's been a great show so far.
055:39:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; 55 hours, 39 minutes now into the flight. We presently show Odyssey and Aquarius at an altitude of 175,552 nautical miles [325,122 km]. Now traveling at a speed of 3,171 feet per second [967 m/s]. Although we copied no voice confirmation as to exactly when spacecraft commander Jim Lovell first went inside Aquarius, the Flight Plan called for a ingress time of 54 hours, 30 minutes and we assumed that this occurred around that time.
055:40:20|T|CDR|And finally, Jack's let me back into the Odyssey as we slide on through the tunnel here.
055:41:14|T|CDR|Houston, 13. Are you still on TV?
055:41:17|C|Lousma|Yes, we sure are. We've got a good picture of the skipper there.
055:41:22|T|CDR|Okay. What we can show you now, a little added benefit, we've got the drogue on Fred's couch in the Command Module right now, we stowed it temporarily while we're checking out the - out Aquarius and underneath his couch, we've got the probes stowed. Quite a big cumbersome device, and we'll get a shot of it for you.
055:42:13|T|CDR|You're looking now at our probe, the place on the nose of Odyssey. It's a very heavy thing but I suppose in zero gravity it weighs nothing, and it's much easier to move around. As a matter of fact, both Fred and Jack commented, as many people in the past have, of how much bigger the spacecraft appears in actual flight when you have such ease in moving compared to our simulator which make training rather difficult.
055:42:58|C|Lousma|Okay. We're seeing a good picture of the probe there, Jim, and looks like the characters shaved before the show this time.
055:43:10|T|CDR|Well, Fred said he had to keep up his TV image.
055:43:17|T|LMP|Yes. That may be my first and last time though, Jack.
055:43:21|T|CDR|It took Fred one hour to shave.
055:43:37|T|CDR|We might give you a quick - a quick shot of our entertainment on board the spacecraft, which has been keeping us company for some time.
055:44:15|T|CDR|This little tape recorder has been a big benefit - has been a big benefit to us in passing some of our time away on our transit to the Moon, and it's rather odd to see it floating like this in Odyssey while it's playing the theme from '2001'. And, of course, the tapes wouldn't be complete without 'Aquarius'.
055:45:08|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. We're seeing the tape recorder now, and just - by the way, how long do you expect to keep the TV on this evening?
055:45:18|T|CDR|Well, whenever you - Stand by one.
055:45:25|T|LMP|Yes, I got them with the cabin repress valve again there, Jack.
055:45:29|T|CDR|Every time he does that our hearts - our hearts jump in our mouth. And, Jack, any time you want to terminate TV, we're all set to go.
055:46:01|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. It's been a real good TV show. We think we ought to conclude it from here now. What do you think?
055:46:11|T|CDR|Roger. Sounds good. And this is the crew of Apollo 13 wishing everybody there a nice evening, and we're just about ready to close out our inspection of Aquarius and get back for a pleasant evening in Odyssey. Good night.
055:46:30|C|Lousma|Thank you, 13.
055:46:34|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 55 hours, 47 minutes. Apollo 13 presently at 177,861 nautical miles [329,399 km] away. Velocity now reading 3,263 feet per second [995 m/s].
055:48:40|C|Lousma|Apollo 13, Houston. The next thing we'd like you to do is to -
055:48:45|T|CMP|Go ahead.
055:48:46|C|Lousma|- we'd like you to roll right to 060 and null your rates for photography of the Comet Bennett. To do that, we would like you to enable quads C and D. For the maneuver, use all your quads. And in precisely 1 minute, we'd like you to terminate the battery charge on battery B. One other request, we'd like to have you verify -
055:49:12|T|CMP|Okay. Will do.
055:49:14|C|Lousma|One other request, we'd like you to verify your High Gain configuration. We'd like to know what track mode, what servo, and what beam width.
055:49:25|T|CMP|Okay, Jack, during the TV, we were Auto Track, Narrow Beam Width, and the Primary Electronics. And we had a good lockup. Just after we started the maneuver, I was able to lock you up and get real good signal strength, and it just seemed that right there at about 239 degrees in yaw, that the signal strength would just drop off and yaw would go to zero and pitch would go to 90.
055:50:05|C|Lousma|Roger. We copy, and the TV show was great.
055:50:12|T|CMP|Okay, real fine. Okay, I'm going to maneuver to 060, 090, and 0.
055:50:31|C|Lousma|And, 13, we'd like you to check C-4 thruster.
055:51:33|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. The battery charge has been terminated on the battery B.
055:51:38|C|Lousma|Roger. We see it, Jack. And we got a reading of minus 2 degrees on the docking index. We'd like to know if that's 2.0 precise or if it's 2.1 or 1.9.
055:51:54|T|CMP|No. It's a minus 2.0 precisely.
055:51:56|C|Lousma|Thank you.
055:52:58|C|Lousma|13, we've got one more item for you, when you get a chance. We'd like you to stir up your cryo tanks. In addition, I have shaft and trunnion -
055:53:06|T|CMP|Okay.
055:53:07|C|Lousma|- for looking at the Comet Bennett, if you need it.
055:53:12|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by.
055:55:19|T|CMP|Okay, Houston -
055:55:19|T|CDR|- Houston -
055:55:20|T|CMP|I believe we've had a problem here.
055:55:28|C|Lousma|This is Houston. Say again, please.
055:55:35|T|CDR|Uh, Houston, we've had a problem. We've had a Main B Bus Undervolt.
055:55:42|C|Lousma|Roger. Main B Undervolt.
055:55:58|C|Lousma|Okay, stand by, 13. We're looking at it.
055:56:10|T|LMP|Okay. Right now, Houston, the voltage is - is looking good. And we had a pretty large bang associated with the Caution and Warning there. And as I recall, Main B was the one that had had an amp spike on it once before.
055:56:40|C|Lousma|Roger, Fred.
055:56:54|T|LMP|In the interim here, we're starting to go ahead and button up the tunnel again.
055:57:01|C|Lousma|Roger.
055:57:04|T|LMP|Yes. That jolt must have rocked the sensor on - see now - O<sub>2</sub> Quantity 2. It - was oscillating down around 20 to 60 percent. Now it's fullscale high again.
055:57:22|C|Lousma|Roger.
055:57:30|T|CDR|And, Houston, we had a RESTART on our computer and we had a PGNCS light and the Restart Reset.
055:57:37|C|Lousma|Roger. Restart and a PGNCS light. Reset on a PGNCS, Reset -
055:57:44|T|CDR|Okay. And we're looking at our S - Service Module RCS Helium 1. We have - B is barber pole and D is barber pole; Helium 2, D is barber pole, and Secondary Propellants, I have A and C barber pole. BMAG temperatures?
055:58:07|T|LMP|Okay, AC 2 is showing zip. I'm going to try to reconfigure on that, Jack.
055:58:13|C|Lousma|Roger.
055:58:25|T|LMP|Yes. We got a Main Bus A Undervolt now, too, showing.
055:58:29|C|Lousma|Main A Undervolt.
055:58:33|T|LMP|It's reading about 25&frac12;. Main B is reading zip right now.
055:59:33|T|CDR|And, Houston, Odyssey.
055:59:38|C|Lousma|Stand by one, Jim.
056:00:35|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We'd like you to attempt to reconnect fuel cell 1 to Main A and fuel cell 3 to Main B. Verify that quad Delta is open.
056:00:53|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. I'm showing - I tried to reset and fuel cell 1 and 3 are both showing gray flags, but they are both showing zip on the flows.
056:01:08|C|Lousma|We copy.
056:03:17|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Are you still reading 13?
056:03:20|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. We're reading you. We're trying to come up with some good ideas here for you.
056:03:29|T|LMP|Okay. Let me give you some readings ... 
056:03:31|T|LMP|In the interim to help Main A voltage, Jack. I've got Bus Tie AC on.
056:03:37|C|Lousma|Say again, Fred.
056:03:42|T|LMP|In the interim, to help out Main A voltage, I've got Main Bus Tie Bat AC, On. Or would you rather accept the 25 volts we are seeing on Main A?
056:03:52|C|Lousma|Okay. Bus Tie AC, On.
056:04:09|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We need Omni Charlie, please.
056:04:19|T|LMP|You got it.
056:05:32|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We'd like you to verify couple of readings for us. We would like the nitrogen pressure on fuel cell 1. We need the oxygen pressure on fuel cell 2.
056:05:46|T|LMP|Okay. Nitrogen on 1 and oxygen on 2. Is that correct ?
056:05:50|C|Lousma|Negative. Oxygen on 3.
056:05:54|T|LMP|Okay.
056:06:24|T|LMP|Okay. The systems test 1-A says zip.
056:06:44|T|LMP|And 2-Baker, which is 3 oxygen, says 0.6.
056:06:50|C|Lousma|2 Baker says 0.6, and say again the other one.
056:06:57|T|LMP|Fuel cell 1 nitrogen reads zero.
056:07:01|C|Lousma|Roger. Zero.
056:08:47|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We'd like you to open circuit fuel cell 1; leave 2 and 3 as is.
056:08:55|T|LMP|Okay. I'll get to work on that.
056:08:57|T|CDR|And, Jack, our O<sub>2</sub> quantity number 2 tank is reading zero. Did you get that?
056:09:04|C|Lousma|O<sub>2</sub> Quantity number 2 is zero.
056:09:07|T|CDR|That's AC, okay. Yes, that's good AC and it looks to me, looking out the hatch, that we are venting something. We are venting something out into the - into space.
056:09:22|C|Lousma|Roger. We copy your venting.
056:09:29|T|CDR|It's a gas of some sort.
056:09:49|T|LMP|Okay. Fuel cell 1, you just wanted it off the line now, Jack, is that right?
056:09:52|C|Lousma|We just wanted you to open the circuit on fuel cell 1.
056:09:58|T|LMP|Okay. She's off the line.
056:11:24|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. This rapid exchange of conversation you've heard, may the main B bus is off the line, fuel cells 1 and 3 also off the line, fuel cell 2 is presently on the line. We now show 13 in an altitude of 178,643 nautical miles [330,847 km]. We're at 56 hours, 12 minutes into the flight.
056:12:47|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We see you getting close to gimbal lock there. We'd like you to bring up all quad Cs on Main A, quad C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4 on Main A, and also bring B-3 and B-4 up on Main A.
056:13:14|C|Lousma|13, Houston. Do you read?
056:13:20|T|LMP|Yes. We got it.
056:13:21|T|CDR|Affirm.
056:13:22|C|Lousma|Okay. Can you tell us anything about the venting, where it is coming from, what window you see it at.
056:13:30|T|CMP|It's coming out of window 1, right now, Jack, and could you give me the thrusters again?
056:13:35|C|Lousma|Okay, the thrusters -
056:13:37|T|CMP|What buses?
056:13:38|C|Lousma|We'd like - on Main A, we'd like Charlie 1, 2, 3, and 4. Also Bravo 3 and 4 on Main A.
056:13:52|T|CMP|Okay. Got it.
056:14:10|P|PAO|The reference there is to the Reaction Control System thrusters. We're 56 hours, 14 minutes now into the flight.
056:14:42|C|Lousma|13, we need Omni Bravo.
056:14:46|T|CDR|Omni Bravo.
056:16:08|C|Lousma|Okay, 13; this is Houston. We'd like you to go to your G&amp;C checklist, the pink pages, 1-5. Do powerdown until we get a Delta of 10 amps. Over.
056:16:21|T|CMP|All right.
056:16:23|T|CDR|Roger.
056:16:54|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. That last report from Lousma asked the 13 crew to reduce the electrical load on the spacecraft.
056:17:03|T|CDR|Okay, Jack, say again that - area for the powerdown; it's not in the pink pages, the 1-5.
056:17:10|C|Lousma|Okay. We'd like you to go down that powerdown procedure until you get a Delta of 10 amps. Over.
056:17:21|T|CDR|Roger ...
056:17:48|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston -
056:17:50|C|Lousma|13, Houston. Did you copy our powerdown request?
056:17:57|T|CMP|Roger, Jack. We're - yes, we're doing it right now.
056:17:59|T|CDR|Where did you say that was located, Jack?
056:18:03|C|Lousma|That's in your systems checklist, page 1-5.
056:18:24|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston, we repeat again that -
056:18:26|C|Lousma|And, 13, you might also check for those pages in your launch checklist. They're emergency pages; pink pages, 1-5, and we'd like you to power down until you get -
056:18:37|T|CMP|Okay. That was in the launch checklist, Jack.
056:18:42|C|Lousma|Roger. Power down until you get an amperage of 10 amps less than what you got now. Over.
056:18:50|T|CDR|Okay.
056:19:02|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. We repeat again, the main Bus B on the Command and Service Module is now off the line. They're functioning with main Bus A. Fuel Cells 1 and 3 connected with Bus B are now off the line.
056:22:06|T|LMP|Okay. Jack. Are you happy with the amps we have now?
056:22:10|C|Lousma|Stand by one, Fred.
056:22:15|T|CMP|Okay, Jack, and on this page 1-5, we proceeded right down the list, all the way down; we're right now at BMAG number 2 is in Warm Up.
056:22:26|C|Lousma|Roger. We copy BMAG 2 in Warm Up. We'll follow you through.
056:22:31|T|CMP|Okay, and something is giving us rates, Jack, both in pitch and roll, so I'm suspecting that maybe it's whatever it is that's venting back there. I've had to use Direct in order to stabilize this, and as soon as I do, we're starting to pick up rates again. Can you pick up any jets firing?
056:22:54|C|Lousma|Stand by. What direction are your rates in, Jack?
056:23:06|T|CMP|It's negative pitch and negative roll.
056:23:12|C|Lousma|Roger.
056:24:42|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We need to get some more instrumentation up. We'd like you to put Inverter 1 on both AC Buses. Over.
056:24:53|T|LMP|Okay.
056:25:06|T|LMP|Okay, you got Inverter 1 on both AC Buses now.
056:25:19|T|LMP|And Jack, one of the items that we turned off was the - all the fuel cell pumps. Okay, and you might let us know when fuel cell 2 needs its pump back; we ought to take care of that guy.
056:25:37|C|Lousma|Roger.
056:25:45|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred, we want Fuel Cell 2 Pumps to AC1, please.
056:25:55|T|CDR|Fuel Cell 2 to AC1. Roger.
056:26:00|T|LMP|Okay, it's on AC1.
056:27:48|C|Lousma|Omni Charlie, please, 13.
056:27:52|T|CDR|Omni Charlie.
056:28:06|C|Lousma|Okay, 13. We've got lots and lots of people working on this; we'll give you some dope as soon as we have it, and you'll be the first one to know.
056:28:19|T|CDR|Oh, thank you.
056:28:29|T|CMP|Okay, Jack, and the weird configuration we're sitting in now is we have the hatch installed, we still have the probe and drogue inside the Command Module, and we're going to stay in this situation until you - kind of give us an okay to reinstall the probe and drogue.
056:28:47|C|Lousma|Roger. We'll give you an answer.
056:28:48|T|LMP|Or, if necessary, to use the LM consumables.
056:28:52|C|Lousma|Roger.
056:32:11|C|Lousma|13, we'd like to have you put thruster Alpha 3 on Main A, please.
056:32:19|T|CDR|Alpha 3 on Main A.
056:32:24|T|CMP|Okay, Jack, are you monitoring the quad temps in quad A - package temps?
056:32:31|C|Lousma|Affirmative.
056:33:37|C|Lousma|13, this is Houston. We'd like to power down just a little bit more, so let's get BMAG 2, Off; and make sure your lights are down. Over.
056:33:49|T|CDR|Okay. The lights are down, and BMAG 2's going from Standby to Off.
056:33:57|P|PAO|The BMAG is part of the SCS system on the Apollo Command Module, of course, we're still attached to the Lunar Module, so this is less of a crucial item to power down at this time. We're at 56 hours, 34 minutes into the flight. Continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
056:34:27|C|Lousma|13, Houston -
056:34:28|T|CMP|Okay, Jack, now I've got a rate -
056:34:29|C|Lousma|- we'd like you to open circuit fuel cell 3.
056:34:36|T|CDR|Open circuit fuel cell 3.
056:34:37|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Jack.
056:34:46|T|LMP|Okay, fuel cell 3 is off the line now.
056:35:16|C|Lousma|And 13, Houston. We'd like you to turn all your Bravo thrusters Off; and put all your Delta thrusters on Main A, please.
056:35:26|T|CDR|All Delta thrusters on Main A and all Bravo thrusters Off. Roger.
056:35:55|C|Lousma|13, Houston. Turn Battery A, Off -
056:35:56|T|CMP|Okay, Jack, ...
056:35:57|T|SC|...
056:35:59|T|CMP|That's right; we were pulling current all the time.
056:36:00|T|CDR|Battery A, Off. Roger.
056:36:05|T|CMP|Now you're ... up.
056:36:07|T|CDR|I'm transmitting. I don't have any current now.
056:36:15|T|CMP|Hey, it's off - it's off. They - they killed the bus completely now.
056:37:07|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We'd like you to isolate your O<sub>2</sub> surge tank. Over.
056:37:19|T|CMP|Surge tank off now, Jack? Okay, Jack, are you copying - O<sub>2</sub> tank 1 cryo pressure?
056:37:30|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. And we're trying to get power to that tank. Stand by; we're working on it.
056:37:38|T|CMP|Okay.
056:39:05|T|CMP|Okay. We had a - Service Module RCS B light, Jack, due to package temperature.
056:39:13|C|Lousma|Service Module RCS B. We copy. No problem.
056:39:21|T|CMP|Let's read you the lights we got on now; Cryo Press, Fuel Cell 1, Fuel Cell 3, Main Bus B Undervolt, Suit Compressor.
056:39:33|C|Lousma|Roger, we copy them and we'd like to build up the pressure in O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, so turn the heaters on manually; we'll watch the pressure for you.
056:39:44|T|CMP|Okay, do you want to see -
056:39:45|C|Lousma|Go ahead.
056:39:46|T|CMP|- We're going to get a Main Bus A Undervolt, probably.
056:39:49|C|Lousma|Roger. We realize that; we feel we can stand 5 more amps on it.
056:39:56|T|CMP|Okay.
056:40:00|T|CDR|Okay, heater on tank 1's On.
056:41:52|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We'd like you to additionally bring on the fans in O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, and we can stand the additional amperage on that.
056:42:03|T|CDR|Okay - bring up the fans on O<sub>2</sub> tank 1.
056:44:32|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We'd like you to check some circuit breakers on panel 226. Cryo O<sub>2</sub> Heater number 1, Main A, and check the three Cryo Fan Motors, Tank 1, three phases.
056:44:56|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. 226 is configured just like it should be. I got three Reacs breakers and three RAD breakers open. All the rest are closed.
056:45:11|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. Thank you.
056:45:55|T|CMP|Jack, looking outside, the number of particles has diminished greatly, almost ceased now, which indicates maybe what was venting has almost stopped.
056:46:09|C|Lousma|Roger, Jack. Thank you. We copy.
056:46:14|T|CMP|I'm still getting some rates in negative pitch, though.
056:46:17|C|Lousma|Roger.
056:46:28|C|Lousma|And, 13, we'd like to verify that both BMAGs are Off, please.
056:46:35|T|CMP|Negative. We just have one BMAG. BMAG number 1 is still On.
056:46:43|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. Let's take BMAG 1, Off.
056:46:50|T|CMP|Okay. BMAG number 1, Off, now.
056:48:06|C|Lousma|13, this is Houston. We'd like you to give us a survey of your displays on MDCs 1 and 2. Give us gauge readings and talkbacks. Over.
056:48:22|T|CDR|Okay. We'll start with display number 1.
056:48:30|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. On MDC 1, there's nothing abnormal. All the rate indicators are zero. Ball number 2 is frozen, of course; we lost Main B. I've got - Ball number 1 appears to be working normally. Right now I'm sitting at roll 0, pitch 180, and yaw about 13 degrees. I'm going to try and hold 0, 180, and 0.
056:49:08|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. The center panel - I'm looking at the RCS indicator A. We have a package temperature of about 180. Our helium pressure is 3900. I'm looking at fuel pressure of about 180 and percentage of about, I'd say 85 percent. B is about the same, except that that package pressure is 190. On quad C, we're looking about the same, except that the package temperature is 100. On quad D, we're looking at package temperature of 160. All other indications are about the same. CM pressure - RCS pressure is looking nominal. Helium pressure's up around 4000. And package temperature is about - a little less than 80 on ring 1 and about the same on ring 2.
056:50:11|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston.
056:50:12|T|CDR|And the - talkbacks on the SM RCS, I've got Helium 1 now are all gray. Helium 2 are all gray. Primary Propellant all gray. Secondary Propellant, I've got two barber pole, and A is barber pole, B gray, C barber pole, and D gray. Okay. On the ECS Radiators, barber pole is gray. On the - On the ECS, Primary indicator.
056:50:57|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. Starting at the top. Okay. The Cryo Tanks; H<sub>2</sub> 1 is reading 230 and the same for 2. Our O<sub>2</sub> Cryo Tank 1 is - looks like it's barely holding its own at 300. And, Cryo Tank 2 is reading zip. Our quantities: H<sub>2</sub> 1 is reading 73; 2, 74. On the O<sub>2</sub> side, we're reading O<sub>2</sub> 1 at quantity, 76; O<sub>2</sub> 2 pegged to full scale high. RAD Temps Primary Inlet, we're reading about 55; RAD Out is reading about 30, and the Secondary Outlet is reading -
056:52:07|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control  -
056:52:08|T|LMP|- reading 52 degrees. And the Evap Out Temp is 45; Steam Pressure, 0.17; and Glycol Discharge, 48. Suit Compressor is reading zip. The Accum is reading 30; H<sub>2</sub>O Waste is reading about 34; Potable's reading about 98; Secondary RAD Inlet is reading about 71; and the RAD Out is about 30; Glycol Evap Temp is reading 65, Steam Pressure pegged full scale high; Discharge Pressure, 9 psi.
056:53:06|C|Lousma|Excuse me, Fred; I'd like to butt in here a minute. We'd like to have Thruster C-1 off.
056:53:17|T|CDR|C-1 is off.
056:53:18|C|Lousma|And proceed -
056:53:19|T|LMP|Okay -
056:53:20|C|Lousma|- my last copy is Secondary RAD In.
056:53:28|T|LMP|Okay. Your Secondary RAD In, I gave to you 70 - about 72 degrees; the RAD Out is about 30; the Glycol Evap Temp is reading about 65; Steam Pressure full scale high, Glycol Discharge Pressure about 9 psi. The Accum - Secondary Accumulator is about 30 - 34 percent. Our temperatures: Suits showing about 52 degrees; Cabin, about 58 degrees; pressures, Suit reading 4.1, Cabin at 5. Partial Pressure CO<sub>2</sub> is up to little over 1, about 1.1. On the SPS side of the house, the temperature is 72 degrees, helium's reading 3500; N<sub>2</sub> A is reading 2300; N<sub>2</sub> B, about 2450. And our ullage pressures: Fuel is reading about 165; Oxidizer 170. Fuel cells: Fuel Cell 1, both flows, they're zip; Skin Temp 405 degrees; Condenser Exhaust is lower scale. Fuel Cell 2 - right now we've got an O<sub>2</sub> or an H<sub>2</sub> Flow reading of 0.13 to 0.14, and the O<sub>2</sub> Flow is right now pegged full scale high although it has been varying depending on thruster activity which has also given us Main Bus A undervolts from a steady reading of about 1.1 up to full scale high. The T-skin is about 445 and the Condenser Exhaust, 17 - correction, 180. Let's see if you want it on the DC indicator: Fuel Cell 1 is 0 amps; 2 is reading somewhere between 44 and about - oscillating 44 to 48 again depending on thruster activity.
056:56:03|C|Lousma|Stand by.
056:56:03|T|LMP|- is 0 amps. Say again, Jack.
056:56:22|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston, continuing to troubleshoot with Apollo 13 crew, closely watching oxygen quantities and pressures in the Command Module. Isolating the surge tank leaves oxygen for entry if this should become necessary. Also, if necessary, the 13 crew could open a tunnel and use oxygen from the Lunar Module.
056:56:23|T|CDR|Houston, 13.
056:56:55|T|LMP|Hello, Houston; Apollo 13. How do you read?
056:57:07|C|Lousma|Okay, 13. This is Houston. It appears to us that we're losing O<sub>2</sub> flow through fuel cell 3. So, we want you to close the Reac valve on fuel cell 3. It looks like fuel cell 1 and 2 are trying to hold up okay. You copy?
056:57:26|T|LMP|Are you saying fuel cell 1 and 2 - 1 and 2 are trying to hold up but we're leaking O<sub>2</sub> out of fuel cell 3? And you want me to shut the Reac valve on fuel cell 3? Did I hear you right?
056:57:40|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. Close the Reac valve on fuel cell 3.
056:57:48|T|LMP|Okay. I'll go to the SSR page. Do you want me to go through that whole smash for fuel cell shutdown? Is that correct?
056:57:57|C|Lousma|Stand by.
056:58:04|P|PAO|Apollo 13, now 180,098 nautical miles [333,541 km] from Earth. Velocity now reading 3,219 feet per second [981 m/s]. We're at 56 hours, 58 minutes now in the flight.
056:58:24|C|Lousma|Okay, 13. We want you to turn the inline heaters off on fuel cell 1. Then we want you to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure on fuel cell 3. Read back.
056:58:40|T|CMP|Okay. Shut down the inline heater on fuel cell 1. We're proceeding with the shutdown, special subroutine, for fuel cell 3.
056:58:50|C|Lousma|That's affirmative.

056:59:59|C|Lousma|Okay. You got Omni Bravo and we'd like to have you verify that the tape recorder is off please.
057:00:08|T|CMP|That's verified. Okay, Jack. I'm sitting here with an 0618 showing and I can't get rid of it. Oh, stand by just did.
057:00:48|T|CDR|Okay. Fuel cell 3 Reac's Off, Houston.
057:00:52|C|Lousma|Roger, Jim. Thank you.
057:01:17|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. Speaking from the spacecraft for most of that conversation has been Lunar Module Pilot, Fred Haise. We're at 57 hours, 01 minute now in the flight.
057:01:54|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Step 2, special subroutine 1 for the fuel cell procedure, has been completed.
057:02:01|C|Lousma|Roger. Thank you.
057:04:29|T|CMP|Okay. Jack. I'd like to bring on jet A-4. I've got no negative pitch control, and - negative pitch control, and right now neither Direct or Auto coils.
057:04:47|C|Lousma|Okay. You say no pitch in either Direct or Auto? You want to bring on A-4?
057:04:53|T|CMP|Yes. I've got a positive pitch rate and I can't stop it.
057:04:58|C|Lousma|Okay.
057:05:08|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. Bring A-4 on; stop the pitch rate.
057:05:14|T|CMP|Okay. That got it.
057:05:35|C|Lousma|And, 13, we need Omni Charlie, please.
057:05:41|T|CMP|Omni Charlie.
057:05:46|C|Lousma|And, Fred, we would like to have you verify fuel cell reactants talkback is barber pole.
057:05:54|T|LMP|That's affirm. I watched it and it went barber pole as I threw the switch.
057:06:01|C|Lousma|Roger.
057:08:01|T|CMP|Okay. Jack. Let me give you a thruster configuration right now. Able 1, Charlie 1, Able 2 are off. Charlie 2, Main A, all the thrusters that I call that are on are on Main A. Baker 1, Off. Dog 1, On; Baker 2, Off; Dog 2, On. Able 3, Charlie 3, Able 4, Charlie 4, On. Baker 3, Off; Dog 3, On; Baker 4, Off; Dog 4, on.
057:09:27|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. That thruster configuration looks okay.
057:09:35|T|CMP|All right. Okay. Do you want some readings from the Systems Test Meter regarding fuel cells?
057:09:45|C|Lousma|Stand by one on that, Jack. Let me ask the EECOM.
057:09:46|T|CMP|We've got some incompatibilities here.
057:10:03|C|Lousma|Okay, 13. We'd like to have you give us those systems test readings on fuel cell 1 and 3, please.
057:10:11|T|CDR|Okay. 1 and 3 coming up.
057:10:14|T|LMP|Okay. Jack, 1-A is reading, lower scale, 0; 1-B is reading. 3.45. Okay. You only want fuel cell 1 and 3. Okay. Ignore that, 1-B reading. 1-C is reading 3.4. Now, 1-D is reading 2.4. 2-B is reading 0.25.
057:11:09|C|Lousma|Roger. Is that 2 Bravo, Fred?

057:14:14|C|Lousma|Roger. We're seeing that. We confirm it.
057:15:04|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We're going to have to have you go through the shutdown procedure on fuel cell 1. Our O<sub>2</sub> pressure is going down as you note and the temperature confirms it. Do you copy?
057:15:24|T|CMP|Okay. Well, what bus configuration - What main bus do you want powered?
057:15:36|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. We want you to leave the bus configuration as it is. Fuel cell 2 on Main A, and we need Omni Bravo.
057:15:52|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. We're proceeding on the shutdown procedure for fuel cell 1.
057:16:35|C|Lousma|And, 13, Houston. We'd like you to isolate the Repress package, please.
057:16:42|T|CMP|Okay.
057:16:43|T|CDR|Isolate the Repress package. Roger.
057:16:45|T|CMP|I can confirm Repress package is off.
057:16:48|C|Lousma|Roger. So now you've got the Repress package and the surge tank isolated. Is that affirm?
057:16:55|T|CMP|That is Charlie.
057:16:59|T|CMP|Okay. Now, this is - We're ready to close the Reacs on fuel cell 1; is that right?
057:17:35|C|Lousma|Jack, stand by on the fuel -
057:17:36|T|CMP|On that last - confirmation. Okay.
057:17:41|C|Lousma|Roger. We're - We're giving you one last -
057:17:42|T|CMP|We want to just get one last confirmation.
057:17:45|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. We're getting that last confirmation. Stand by, please.
057:17:51|T|CMP|Okay.
057:18:01|C|Lousma|Okay, 13. We verify that we want you to close down - shut down fuel cell 1, close Reacs valve.
057:18:10|T|CDR|Roger -
057:18:11|T|CMP|Okay.
057:18:12|T|CDR|- fuel cell 1; close the Reacs valve.
057:18:19|T|CMP|Fuel cell -
057:18:20|T|CDR|Reacs valve on fuel cell 1 is closed.
057:18:45|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. I can confirm step 2. The fuel cell shutdown procedure is complete for fuel cell 1.
057:18:55|C|Lousma|Roger.
057:19:58|C|Lousma|13, we recommend that you enable BD roll in the DAP. Over.
057:20:05|T|CMP|Okay. Will do -
057:20:06|T|CDR|BD roll in the DAP.
057:20:23|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We're working on the big dish now, so turn the High Gain Power switch, Off, please.
057:20:32|T|CDR|Okay.
057:20:55|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. When we got the loud bang, we got also a restart. Did you copy that? Is - does GUIDO want anything, a Verb 74 or anything done with the CMC?
057:21:06|C|Lousma|Stand by.
057:21:54|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We're ready with a Verb 74 now, please.
057:22:05|T|CMP|Coming down at you.
057:23:54|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. It looks like O<sub>2</sub> tank 1 pressure is just a hair over 200.
057:24:02|C|Lousma|We confirm that here and the temperature also confirms it.
057:24:09|T|CMP|Okay. Does it look like it's still going down?
057:24:12|C|Lousma|It's slowly going to zero, and we're starting to think about the LM lifeboat.
057:24:20|T|CMP|Yes. That's what we're thinking about, too. You want me to do a quick P52? It kind of looks like - We've been talking it over, and it kind of looks like we'd probably align our plats - LM platform with our platform and then power down the CM, and keep the LM powered up doing a DPS - whatever DPS burns you give us?
057:24:54|C|Lousma|13, we're not going to concern ourselves at the moment with a DPS burn. It's going to be some time before we'd get to that; but we're working on other procedures to give you, which will allow us to use the LM systems. Over.
057:25:12|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine.
057:26:40|C|Lousma|Apollo 13, Houston. We'd like to charge battery A now.
057:26:46|T|CDR|Charge battery A. Roger.
057:27:13|C|Lousma|And, Jack, in regard to your question about the P52 and LM platform, it's - There's no need to worry about that now. We wouldn't be using the LM platform for - until about 79 hours, so let's go as is on the platform for now. Over.
057:27:30|T|CDR|Okay. We understand.
057:27:37|T|CMP|Okay, Jack.
057:30:13|T|CMP|And, Jack, we've turned off the waste dump heater. If you're going to consider dumping any more waste water, we probably ought to do it while the duct is warm there.
057:30:30|C|Lousma|Roger. Stand by, Jack.
057:30:34|T|CMP|Okay.
057:30:38|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. Let's keep the water; no need for a dump right now.
057:30:43|T|CMP|All right.
057:32:15|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We see the Prop Isol valve on RCS quad Charlie closed, so we'd like to also disable Auto RCS feature in quad Charlie.
057:32:30|T|CDR|You want to isolate the Auto RCS features in quad Charlie ?
057:32:33|C|Lousma|Affirmative.
057:32:44|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. I didn't plan to reset that quad Charlie Prop Isol valve. Do you want me to do that? Okay. We just tried it and quad Alpha and Charlie barber poles are showing.
057:33:01|C|Lousma|Stand by, Jim.
057:33:03|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. That's the sec - secondary propellant barber poles on Alpha and Charlie.
057:34:47|C|Lousma|13, Houston. It won't do any good to try to power the propellant valves on A and C, so we want you to disable the Auto on RCS Charlie. And we have a procedure for getting power from the LM we'd like you to copy down.
057:35:08|T|CMP|Okay.
057:35:09|T|CDR|Stand by, Jack.
057:35:11|T|CMP|That sounds like good news.
057:36:05|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. About how long is it?
057:36:12|C|Lousma|It's not a very long procedure, Fred. We figure we've got about 15 minutes worth of power left in the Command Module, so we want you to start getting over in the LM and getting some power on that. And, you ready to copy your procedure?
057:36:27|T|LMP|Okay.
057:36:29|C|Lousma|Okay. In the CSM.
057:36:30|T|LMP|Stand by.
057:36:40|T|LMP|Go ahead.
057:36:41|C|Lousma|Okay. In the CSM on panel 5, circuit breakers LM Power 1 and 2, Open. Then LM Power switch, reset and release. In the LM, on panel 11 and panel 16, Translunar Bus Tie. Both circuit breakers Close. On panel 16, circuit breaker Ascent ECA Control, Close. On 16, Descent ECA Control, Close. On panel 14, put your BAT 5 Normal feed On. BATs 1, 2, 3, and 4 Low Voltage taps, On. BAT 5 Normal feed, Off. Ascent ECA Control, Open. You copy?
057:38:08|T|LMP|Stand by one.
057:38:24|T|LMP|Okay. In the CSM, on panel 5, we want CB LM Power 1 and 2, Open. Then the LM Power switch to reset, release. In the LM, panels 11 and 16, X Lunar Bus Tie breakers closed. On panel 16, the Ascent ECA Control closed; the Descent ECA Control closed. On panel 14, BAT 5 Normal feed On, followed by BATS 1, 2, 3, and 4 Low Voltage taps On. Then BAT 5 Normal feed Off. Then Ascent ECA Control breaker Open.
057:38:58|C|Lousma|That's a good readback, Fred.
057:39:14|C|Lousma|And, 13, Houston. As a final effort here, we would like you to turn on the fans in tank 2. Over.
057:39:23|T|CDR|Roger. Understand. Turn on the fans in tank 2.
057:39:34|T|CDR|You want the O<sub>2</sub> fans in tank 2, Jack?
057:39:38|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jim.
057:39:45|T|CDR|O<sub>2</sub> tanks - fans in tank 2 are on.
057:39:48|C|Lousma|Roger.
057:41:31|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We'd like you to start making your way over to the LM now.
057:41:38|T|CMP|Fred and Jim are in the LM.
057:41:42|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. Thank you.
057:41:47|T|LMP|And, Jack, I got LM power on.
057:42:50|T|CMP|Okay. You still with us, Houston?
057:43:03|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. You read 13?
057:43:06|C|Lousma|Reading you loud and clear, Jack. I've got a procedure for -
057:43:10|T|CMP|Okay.
057:43:11|C|Lousma|- the guys in the LM.
057:43:15|T|CMP|You got another one?
057:43:17|C|Lousma|I have an activation procedure. I'd like you to copy it down.
057:43:25|T|LMP|How long is it, Jack?
057:43:27|C|Lousma|It's just four lines. Go to Activation 1, do step 3. Go to Activation 11, omit step 1. Do Activation 12, and then go to Activation 13 and do step 1. Do you copy?
057:43:54|T|CDR|Okay. Is that Activation 1? Do step 3. Is that correct?
057:43:59|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jim.
057:44:03|T|CDR|Activation 11, omit step 1, do the rest. Is that correct?
057:44:06|C|Lousma|That's affirmative.
057:44:12|T|CDR|Do Activation 12 and Activation 13, step 1.
057:44:14|C|Lousma|That's all correct.
057:44:25|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Pressure in tank 1 is approaching 100 psi. What's going to be the symptoms of this fuel cell starting to drop off?
057:44:51|C|Lousma|Stand by, Jack. We'll get the word on that.
057:44:56|T|CMP|Okay.
057:45:06|C|Lousma|And, Jim, when you get to the end of that procedure, we'd also like to have you put the DEMAND REGS to CABIN.
057:45:15|T|CDR|DEMAND REGSs to CABIN. Roger.
057:45:31|T|CDR|Jack, was that Activation 1, step 3 only, or all of Activation 1?
057:45:38|C|Lousma|That's go all the way down to step 3, Jim.
057:45:44|T|CDR|Activation 1 to step 3. Roger.
057:46:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 57 hours, 46 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The Black team of flight controllers is now stationed in Mission Control Center looking at possible alternate missions. As we have an apparent serious oxygen leak in the cyrogenic oxygen in the Service Module. And now in the process of powering down the Command Module in less than 15 minutes remaining of electrical power to the CSM. The Command Module surge tank has been charged with oxygen for entry.
057:46:48|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 13. Never mind.
057:46:54|C|Lousma|13, say again, please.
057:46:58|T|CDR|Oh, we were curious about Activation 11 on the VHF.
057:47:04|C|Lousma|Omit the VHF.
057:47:05|T|LMP|- step 2 Jack. It's got - Okay.
057:47:17|P|PAO|In this scheme of going across to the Lunar Module, still connected with the open tunnel, the Lunar Module would serve as a sort of lifeboat for the crew of Apollo 13. Sometime later in the mission it is expected that they would return to the free return trajectory, which they left yesterday in the midcourse burn number 2. At the pericynthion near the Moon they would use the Descent Propulsion System of the Lunar Module for Trans-Earth Injection burn at about 79 hours, 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. This would produce a day early entry at about 142 hours. That is a day earlier than a nominal free return entry. We're continuing to monitor the situation and still live on air-ground.
057:48:17|C|Lousma|Jack, this is Houston. We want you to keep the IMU up and keep the lights on so you can see in there, and leave battery off - battery A off and, at the appropriate time, we'll put it on Main A. And we're going to keep the IMU up so as we can get a coarse align in the LM.
057:48:38|T|CMP|All right. Real good. Right now, we're charging battery A. Do you want to discontinue that?
057:48:46|C|Lousma|Discontinue the charge on battery A, Jack.
057:49:22|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. I discontinued charge on battery A. You give me the call and I'll turn Bus Tie AC on.
057:49:32|C|Lousma|Roger. And we want you to keep the lights up and the IMU on.
057:49:38|T|CMP|Okay.
057:49:48|C|Lousma|And, Jack, we'd like you to leave the Comm configuration as is until we get Comm with the LM.
057:49:57|T|CMP|Okay.
057:51:08|C|Lousma|And, 13, this is Houston. I've got another procedure for the LM. A short one.
057:51:15|T|CDR|Okay. Ready to copy, Jack.
057:51:17|C|Lousma|Okay. On panel 11, we'd like you to close the LGC DSKY circuit breaker. Then we want you to go to Activation 25; do steps 1, 2, and 3. Then go to Activation 30, and that will give us a docked IMU coarse align. Over.
057:51:41|T|CDR|Roger. Panel 11, close LGC circuit breaker. Activation 25, do steps 1, 2, 3, and then do complete Activation 30. Is that correct?
057:51:50|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. On panel 11, LGC DSKY circuit breaker closed.
057:52:25|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have confirmation now that two of the Apollo 13 crewmen are indeed in the Lunar Module.
057:53:15|C|Lousma|And in the LM, let's go to panel 11 and close the Suit Fan circuit breaker and get suit fan 1 cranked up.
057:53:26|T|CDR|Okay. Panel 11, close Suit Fan circuit breaker, and we'll get the suit fan cranked up.
057:53:30|C|Lousma|That's affirm.
057:53:47|C|Lousma|And, Jack, in the CSM, go to Bypass on the radiators and turn your Glycol Pump off.
057:53:56|T|CMP|Okay. Pull the Bypass; Glycol Pump going off.
057:54:04|C|Lousma|Roger.
057:55:42|C|Lousma|And, 13, in the CSM, we want to verify that all the fuel cell pumps are off, and we want to have you turn off the O<sub>2</sub> fans in the tank 2.
057:55:56|T|CMP|Okay. Tank 2 fans going off. Okay. That leaves me with tank 1 fans on and tank 1 heaters on.
057:56:10|T|CMP|Fuel cell 2 pump going off now.
057:56:21|C|CMP|Fuel cell 2 pump going off now.
057:56:26|T|CMP|Okay.
057:57:28|T|LMP|Jim ... another ... okay. VERB 37 ENTER - Activation 30 - yes.
057:57:55|C|Lousma|13, Houston. We've got AOS on the LM here.
057:58:01|T|CMP|Okay.
057:58:55|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 57 hours, 58 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. To recap briefly the situation here in Mission Control Center; we have an apparently serious problem with a leak in the cryogenic oxygen in the Service Module, which provides the electrical power system coming out of the fuel cells, and also, breathing oxygen for the crew. Now in the process of manning the Lunar Module. Standby.
057:59:23|C|Lousma|And, 13, this is Houston. In the LM, we'd like to have 12, step 3, which is get the batteries on high taps. Over.
057:59:34|T|LMP|Okay.
057:59:41|T|LMP|How you going there? Activation 12, step 3.
058:00:04|P|PAO|Under this alternate mission, the Lunar Module would serve as a lifeboat to bring the Apollo 13 crew back to Earth. That is its consumables, oxygen, electrical power -
058:00:18|T|LMP|Okay. And, Jack, how do you read from Aquarius?
058:00:23|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Say again, please.
058:00:28|T|LMP|Okay. I was just making a Comm check here. I'm on high voltage taps.
058:00:32|C|Lousma|Roger. We see them, Fred, and I'm reading you loud and clear.
058:00:39|T|LMP|Okay. Didn't think I'd be back (in) this soon.
058:00:51|T|LMP|Okay. What next, James? Coarse align?
058:00:57|T|LMP|Do it right. Take your time.
058:01:10|P|PAO|The current thinking is to use the Lunar Module Descent Propulsion System, a big engine of the LM to propel the entire spacecraft stack to a higher velocity as they go around behind the Moon to come back to Earth a day earlier than a normal free return trajectory would return the spacecraft.
058:01:32|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to, on your alignment, can you continue right on through the fine align Activation 31? Go right on through step 7. Over.
058:01:45|T|LMP|Okay. You want to go on 31 through step number 7, Jack.
058:01:50|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. And, Odyssey, we've got another configuration for you. All 16 RCS Auto Select Off. All RCS heaters off. Over.
058:02:06|T|CMP|Okay. I can verify all heaters off. Jack, I've got to keep a fairly minimum deadband until I get through this coarse align.
058:02:15|C|Lousma|Roger.
058:02:26|T|LMP|Okay. Verb 41, Noun 20. Okay. You want plus? Plus or minus? Plus 302.43? Is that right?
058:03:12|T|LMP|Okay. Let me enter it. Okay. What's the next one? Plus 347.78. 347.78. Okay. 08.13. Is that right? Enter. Okay.
058:03:53|C|Lousma|Odyssey, Houston  -
058:03:54|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
058:03:54|C|Lousma|-  your battery A on.
058:03:59|T|CMP|Battery A on now.
058:04:01|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
058:04:03|T|CDR|Houston. Okay. I want you to doublecheck my arithmetic to make sure we got a good coarse align. The roll CAL angle was minus 2 degrees. The Command Module angles were 355.57, 167.78, 351.87.
058:04:36|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. We copy the roll CAL at minus 2.0. The Command Module is 355.57, 167.78, 351.87.
058:05:19|T|LMP|Okay. Verb 41, we've done that. Okay.
058:05:27|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Request high bit rate, please.
058:05:36|T|LMP|You want high bit rate?
058:05:38|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Fred. Won't cost us anything.
058:06:22|C|Lousma|Odyssey, Houston. We'd like you to, on your Comm configuration, go to Primary Power Amp Off, Low Bit Rate, and Downvoice Backup. Over.
058:06:42|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, we need your Suit Gas Diverter to Cabin.
058:06:55|T|LMP|All right. You got it.
058:07:02|T|CMP|Houston. I've gone to Primary Power Amplifier, Off, Low Bit Rate, Downvoice Backup.
058:07:11|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. Thank you. And, Aquarius, your arithmetic looks good on the coarse align, there.
058:07:20|T|CDR|Okay. Okay stand by for an Enter.
058:07:26|T|CDR|Three -
058:07:39|T|LMP|What's the GET; we need the GET. What is it? What's that? 58? 58:07?
058:08:15|T|LMP|58 what?
058:09:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Apollo 13 crewmen Jim Lovell and Fred Haise are just completed -
058:09:16|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
058:09:18|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
058:09:23|T|CDR|Here are the gimbal angles. Command module, 356.69, 163.42, 346.67. Aquarius is 302.26, 345.92, 011.79. Over.
058:09:47|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. I got Command Module 356.65, 163.42, 346.67. Aquarius, 302.26, 345.92, 011.78.
058:10:07|T|CDR|That's 011.79.
058:10:11|C|Lousma|Say again, please.
058:10:17|T|CDR|The LM middle gimbal is 011.79.
058:10:22|C|Lousma|011.79. Got it.
058:10:30|P|PAO|Those angles being read back from Aquarius and from Odyssey were from the coarse alignment of the Lunar Module guidance system platform. Returning to the alternate mission now being considered, the Descent Propulsion System Trans-Earth Injection burn would take place at about 79 hours, 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Producing an entry at about 142 hours. At this point in the translunar coast, it is cheaper and swifter to coast on around the Moon and come back to Earth than it is to do a deep space abort. Continuing to monitor air-ground from Apollo 13, this is Apollo Control.
058:12:10|T|CMP|... flashing.
058:12:19|C|Lousma|Odyssey, Houston. We need a command reset on your - on your Comm, and then we'd like you to power down to CMC, power down the IMU, heaters off on the IMU, but leave the battery A on.
058:12:43|T|LMP|Yes.
058:12:58|C|Lousma|Odyssey, Houston.
058:13:07|T|CMP|... Read me? Are you reading, Houston?
058:13:08|T|LMP|Ask him if he's ...
058:13:10|T|CDR|Yes.
058:13:11|T|LMP|Are you Houston?
058:13:12|T|CDR|Yes.
058:13:13|T|CDR|Houston, this is Odyssey. Go ahead.
058:13:16|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim -
058:13:18|T|LMP|Copy it down.
058:13:20|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. I think I'm reading Jack, now. But what we want him to do is to give us a command reset. And then power down the CMC, power down the IMU, turn the IMU heater off, leave battery A on. Over.
058:14:19|T|LMP|That's just about 80 - in fact, 82 hours out of the two primary cartridges. That's two guys. 24 is what LC8 got. That would be 88 hours. We got a secondary. You're right. We're listening.
058:14:41|C|Lousma|Odyssey, Houston.
058:14:43|T|CMP|They can stand it - Go ahead?
058:14:47|C|Lousma|Yes, Jack. Did you copy down about the CMC IMU?
058:14:52|T|CMP|Yes, Jack. I read it back twice to you. Command reset, which I've done. I'm about to power down the IMU, power down the CMC, turn the IMU heaters off, leave BAT A on.
058:15:07|C|Lousma|That's affirm. Thank you.
058:15:11|T|CMP|Okay. I just got a Master Alarm and Main Bus A Undervolt. And I'm starting to power down, now - We've lost - 
058:15:21|T|LMP|The only advantage to doing it early; if we can power back - the LM back down. The only advantage doing it early is you can do a big burn now and a midcourse and then power the LM down. Otherwise, we got to keep the LM powered up clear until we get around the Moon. Plus it would be insight on the burn. I just hope the G&N hangs up on - hangs in on this one - I'd sure hate to do that one manual.
058:16:05|T|CDR|Oh boy.
058:16:06|C|Lousma|Odyssey, Houston. Couple circuit breakers for you. On panel 276, on our Instrumentation Power Control, open CB number 3 and number 4.
058:16:33|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Panel 276, Instrumentation out and reset -
058:16:39|T|LMP|- a lot of light.
058:16:40|T|CMP|- CB-3 and CB-4 are open.
058:16:45|T|LMP|What?
058:16:47|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Odyssey. and also get your SCS electronics package and power off, and your FDAI Power/GPI off, and your AUTO JET SELECT, all 16 off.
058:17:07|T|CMP|Okay. Well, wait a second. Let me - Let me get the CMC power down.
058:17:13|C|Lousma|Roger, Jack.
058:17:16|T|LMP|I wonder how much that's going to bring this up, here.
058:17:23|T|CDR|Jack, while he's doing that, copy down what you just said again. I want to write it down.
058:17:36|C|Lousma|Aquarius, we need to get your sublimator powered up, Activation page 20 and Activation page 21, step 3. Over.
058:17:52|T|CDR|Roger. Activation page 20 and Activation page 21, step 3, sublimator.
058:17:58|C|Lousma|Roger.
058:18:00|T|LMP|That's Activation, page 20? 
058:18:09|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Now I have to power down IMU. I have no control at all. I'm going to turn my 16 jets off. Say again the other things you wanted?
058:18:28|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. We'd like you to turn off your O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters and fans.
058:18:34|C|Lousma|Correction - tank 1. Turn the fans and heaters off.
058:18:41|T|CDR|Okay. And, Jack, can we turn on the FDAI circuit breakers so we could have a ball to see if we go to gimbal lock or not?
058:18:49|C|Lousma|Stand by.
058:18:53|T|CMP|Houston, he's going to give a 16 Noun 20, Jack. And, okay, I've got O<sub>2</sub> heaters and fans off in tank 1.
058:19:15|T|CDR|And, Jack, let me know if you get close to gimbal lock, would you?
058:19:25|C|Lousma|Jim, we don't want you to power down the ball in the LM. We wanted you to power down the ball in the CSM.
058:19:39|T|CMP|Jack, they haven't powered down -
058:19:42|T|LMP|Jack, we don't have the balls powered up in the LM.
058:19:45|T|CMP|I have the CMC and IMU in the Command Module is powered down. The heaters are out.
058:19:56|T|LMP|And the EVAP flow valve, that's open now, and I've undone my suit hoses here and opened up the suit flow valves; so, we got air flowing in the LM now.
058:20:11|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Will you say again the SCS items you wanted me to power down?
058:20:45|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Do you read Odyssey?
058:20:55|T|CDR|Hello, Houston, Odyssey. How do you read?
058:21:01|T|LMP|His gimbal lock and ours are different, Jim.
058:21:09|C|Lousma|Apollo 13, Houston. Say again, please. You were cut out.
058:21:15|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Do you want me to proceed by the SCS powerdown checklist? I did not copy the SCS items you wanted me to power down.
058:21:32|C|Lousma|Okay, Odyssey. We want to go SCS Electronics Power, Off.
058:21:39|T|CMP|Okay. It's done.
058:21:41|C|Lousma|FDAI Power/GPI, Off. Auto jet Select, 16 -
058:21:47|T|CMP|That's done.
058:21:48|C|Lousma|- Off. And all your Rotational Control Power, Off.
058:21:52|T|CMP|It's done. Rotation Control Power, Direct, and Auto Coils, Off.
058:21:59|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. Tell me there. We need to know when we're getting close to gimbal lock in the LM. We have no balls right now.
058:22:06|C|Lousma|Okay. We want you to power up your eight-ball. We want you to get your RCS heaters on. Pressurize the RCS and open up the Main SOVs. Over.
058:22:23|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. I got two Commander FDAI breakers in, AC and DC, and the two GASTA breakers in AC and DC and next you'll want the RCS heaters all on with the - pressurize the RCS and then the Main SOVs open. And I think they're already open.
058:22:40|C|Lousma|Roger. And, Freddo, get the TCA breakers in last. Please.
058:23:00|T|LMP|Roger. I'm holding open those until you give me a further word anyway. I'm just going to pressurize right now.
058:23:08|T|CDR|Jack (Lousma), are you reading LM gimbal angles?
058:23:38|T|LMP|When you're finished in there, power off, come down here and punch in the audio breakers.
058:24:16|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. I have some gyro torquing angles and the Odyssey is powered down, attitude-controlwise, so LM's got attitude control now.
058:25:13|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston.
058:25:21|T|LMP|Go ahead, Jack.
058:25:24|C|Lousma|Okay. We want you to know that we got some gyro torquing angles for you. And we want you to tell us when you got attitude control in the LM.
058:25:38|T|LMP|Okay. We're still working on the pressurization. I'm getting Jim on the horn here so he can help out, there.
058:25:43|C|Lousma|Roger.
058:26:09|T|CMP|Wonder why.
058:26:14|T|LMP|We got to get this pressurized.
058:26:55|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
058:26:58|C|Lousma|Stand by one, Aquarius, Odyssey. We'd like you to go Direct RCS and hold your present attitude out the window until the LM gets RCS powered up. Go ahead, Jim.
058:27:12|T|CDR|Well, that's my question. We're not - Our 16 20 doesn't match our eight-ball here. We went to FDAIs On, and we don't have our balls completely powered up. There may be a bellyband and our angles don't look the same and we don't want to go into gimbal lock.
058:27:28|C|Lousma|Roger. How far are you from RCS power up - RCS pressurization?
058:27:45|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. I'm right up to where it's Master Arm, On; RCS, Fire; -
058:27:49|T|SC|...
058:27:50|T|LMP|- both Logic Powers out since I didn't go into normal circuit-breaker, didn't have me do that. Do you want A in and then I'll fire them?
058:27:59|C|Lousma|Okay, 13. You're both talking at once. One at a time, please.
058:28:10|T|CMP|Okay. Who's first?
058:28:11|C|Lousma|Close Logic Power A and B, Fred, and pressurize RCS.
058:28:17|T|LMP|Okay.
058:28:24|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Odyssey.
058:28:29|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going to try to do the best I can. I've got a one-attitude reference I'm going to fly according to the lunar terminator.
058:28:37|C|Lousma|Roger, Jack. Just maintain attitude.
058:29:04|T|LMP|What am I doing? I can't do that, anyway. Let's see, cross feed. Nope. Now, and -
058:29:25|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We'll have to get some AC up so you can get a ball reading. Close your Bus Tie Inverter circuit breakers, all four of them on panel 11. Close your AC Bus Volt circuit breaker on panel 11. On panel 16, Inverter 2, Close. Select inverter 2. Over.
058:29:50|T|CDR|That's been completed, Jack.
058:29:58|T|LMP|Okay. The RCS is pressurized now.
058:30:39|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. Do you want us to proceed right on down the line with the RCS check-out and Activation 37 now?
058:30:51|C|Lousma|Stand by, Fred.
058:31:03|T|LMP|Hell, is he still firing up there?
058:31:15|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. Negative on the activation on page 37. We want your RCS pressurized and then get your TCA breakers in and go to PGNS attitude hold.
058:31:53|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. How do you read?
058:31:56|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. This is Houston. We want you to load the DAP with 30120.
058:32:06|T|CDR|Load the DAP with 30120. Complete.
058:32:16|T|LMP|Okay. We need to change that CSM weight.
058:32:25|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. Your CSM weight is 63400.
058:32:51|T|CDR|And Jack, you want us to take control in the LM to stay away from gimbal lock. Over.
058:32:58|C|Lousma|Affirmative. Take control of the LM. PGNS Attitude Hold.
058:33:06|T|LMP|We are.
058:33:08|C|Lousma|And, Odyssey, request you coordinate with Aquarius on attitude control.
058:33:16|T|CMP|Okay.
058:33:17|T|CDR|Roger.
058:33:19|T|CDR|Okay. I don't see where you're firing these things
058:33:22|T|CDR|ATT-HOLD?
058:33:27|T|CDR|Are you firing anything?
058:33:28|T|CMP|I don't think so.
058:33:54|T|CDR|Okay. I got DIRECT.
058:34:04|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, check you ATCA (PGNS) breaker on panel 11 in.
058:34:13|T|CDR|Say again.
058:34:15|C|Lousma|Close, on panel 11, circuit breaker ATCA (PGNS).
058:34:21|T|CDR|ATCA (PGNS). Come on. Let's take it easy now.
058:34:30|T|CDR|Okay. We've got ATCA (PGNS) closed.
058:34:31|T|LMP|Yeah.
058:34:32|T|CDR|Is that okay?
058:34:34|T|LMP|Yeah.
058:34:35|T|CDR|Okay. Now I'm looking.
058:34:37|T|CDR|... okay ...
058:34:46|T|LMP|How about plus?
058:34:48|T|LMP|No ...
058:34:49|T|CDR|Okay. It's already open.
058:34:53|T|CDR|Okay. Shut them down.
058:34:58|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. We got it.
058:35:16|T|CDR|Yes.
058:35:21|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. How's the attitude control?
058:35:27|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. We've got attitude control now in the LM. We're going to try to rotate up to the bellyband.
058:35:34|C|Lousma|Roger.
058:35:38|T|CDR|I like that sound like I got back there.
058:35:59|C|Lousma|Odyssey, Houston. I've got a procedure for you.
058:36:05|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. I'm ...
058:36:09|T|CDR|I want to go up this way to get away from that - the radios are powered, huh?
058:36:16|T|CMP|Yes.
058:36:33|T|CDR|Check your antenna?
058:36:37|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Odyssey is ready to copy.
058:36:40|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. What we want you to do is close the reactants valve on fuel cell 2. Power down your inverters. Power down your battery relay bus. Battery ties, off, and pull your entry circuit breakers, entry battery circuit breakers A, B, and C.
058:37:15|T|CDR|Check the control, and make sure we don't go to gimbal lock, Fred.
058:37:21|T|CMP|Okay, Jack; understand. Close Reac valve circuit breakers in fuel cell 2. Power down inverters. Power down BAT relay bus. BAT TIES, Off. Power entry and both running circuit breakers A, B, and C. All off.
058:37:41|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jack. And close the reactant valve on fuel cell 2, there.
058:37:50|T|CMP|Okay. I'll do that, and Jack'll do that other.
058:38:02|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack; on fuel cell 2, open circuit it.
058:38:18|T|CMP|Okay. Fuel cell 2 is open circuited. Do you want me to go through the standard shutdown procedure for the Reac valves and -
058:38:37|C|Lousma|Odyssey, Houston. All you have to do is close the Reacs valve on fuel cell 2.
058:38:46|T|CMP|Okay. CB Reacs and vent Reac valves all closed.
058:39:24|T|CDR|Yes.
058:39:55|T|CDR|Yes.
058:39:58|T|LMP|... an hour and a half.
058:40:01|T|CDR|Okay.
058:40:06|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
058:40:09|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
058:40:12|T|CDR|Okay. Odyssey is completely powered down, according to the procedure that you read to Jack.
058:40:22|C|Lousma|Roger; we copy. That's where we want to be, Jim.
058:40:36|T|LMP|And, Jack, have you all got good LM data down there now?
058:40:47|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Fred. We're getting good LM data.
058:40:53|T|LMP|Okay. In that case, I think I'll pull out some display breakers and just let you all keep an eye on things.
058:41:02|C|Lousma|Roger.
058:41:04|T|CDR|He's turning his lights off now, too.
058:41:06|C|Lousma|Stand by one on that, Fred.
058:41:18|T|LMP|Okay.
058:41:21|T|CDR|What about these lights up here?
058:41:30|T|LMP|I've got it.
058:41:32|T|CDR|Okay.
058:41:34|T|LMP|Where would you like ...?
058:41:37|T|CDR|...
058:41:47|T|LMP|Oh.
058:42:41|T|CDR|We don't want to lose Comm with him.
058:42:45|T|LMP|I'm watching it.
058:43:52|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Stand by on opening your circuit breakers for displays. We're going to let you know what they are, and I have some gyro torquing angles for you.
058:44:10|T|CDR|Okay. What page is that there gyro torquing?
058:44:12|T|LMP|Okay. What page is the, do we write the gyro torquing angles on there, Jack?
058:44:17|C|Lousma|Stand by.
058:44:18|T|LMP|Okay. We're there now, Jim. Jim's got it. Go ahead with the gyro torquing angles.
058:44:24|C|Lousma|Okay. We'd like you to proceed with the fine align and your gyro torquing angles are X plus 003.30, Y plus 024.80, Z minus 015.10. Over.
058:44:48|T|CDR|Okay. I read your gyro torquing angles as plus 003.30, Y is plus 023, I only have four numbers for Y; you'll have to give that one to me again, and Z is minus 015.10. Read Y again, please.
058:45:06|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. X and Z are correct and Y is plus 024.80.
058:45:19|T|CDR|Okay. We read Y as plus 024.80. We'll proceed on Activation 40 to fine align the platform.
058:45:28|C|Lousma|Roger.
058:45:38|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius, proceed as on page 40 with IMU fine align.
058:46:52|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control; 58 hours, 46 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Lovell and Haise still powering up the Lunar Module, getting attitude control, aligning the platform, in preparation for what turns out to be an alternate mission in which no lunar landing will be possible. However, the spacecraft will fly around the Moon. At this point in translunar coast, it is more economical in propellant and time to continue to coast on around the Moon and come back to Earth interception trajectory. In about 20 minutes in the Houston News Center there will be a press conference in the small briefing room. Stand by.
058:47:41|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Can you see any stars out the LM window?
058:47:53|T|LMP|We'll have to wipe them off, Jack. They're coated with water right now.
058:47:59|T|CDR|Can I get a towel?
058:48:00|T|LMP|Yes, I'll get you one.
058:48:01|C|Lousma|Roger. As soon as you get a chance to - on your position - to take a look, we'd like to know if you can see stars for alignment purposes.
058:48:16|T|LMP|Okay. Jim's going to be in trouble in our present attitude out his side. The Sun's there.
058:48:25|T|CDR|Wait 1.
058:48:29|T|LMP|What have you got? How much you got left in battery A? Okay. I wish I knew what the hell they were thinking right now we got ... number ... batteries ...
058:48:51|T|CDR|They're talking about powering down and doing a P51 here?
058:48:57|T|LMP|No. They were just thinking about P52 -
058:49:00|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Negative on the P51. We want to stay just like we are, but we'd like to be able to correlate what you're doing with some simulator work we're going to crank up. And so if you can give us information as to what stars you can see out the window, we can make that correlation.
058:49:22|T|CDR|Would you say one more time? Give me my COMM carrier. My COMM carrier.
058:49:33|C|Lousma|Jim, what we want you to do is go with your current fine align and disregard the P51. What we're attempting to do is to crank up some LMS simulations to correlate what we can get out your window with what we can get out the LMS window to see if that will help us any. So when you can see some stars, if you can, you think you can recognize them and recognize constellations, please let us know.
058:50:02|T|CDR|Okay. We'll check. Stand by.
058:50:09|P|PAO|Participants in the forthcoming press conference within the next 15 minutes or so will be Manned Spacecraft Center, Deputy Director Christopher C. Craft, Jr., Apollo Spacecraft Program Office Manager James A. McDivitt, and MSC Director of Flight Operations, Sigurd Sjoberg. This will be in the small briefing room in the Houston News Center. We'll be isolated from the air-ground which will be continually fed in real time to the News Center.
058:50:16|T|CDR|Okay. Watch the -
058:50:45|T|CMP|I'm just glad ... particles ...
058:51:25|T|CDR|Okay, stand by.
058:51:40|T|CDR|Okay. Here, unplug me.
058:52:13|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We notice that the O<sub>2</sub> pressure in the Ascent Tank O<sub>2</sub> is a little high, so we want to use some of it. So close Descent O<sub>2</sub> and open Ascent O<sub>2</sub>, tank 2. Over.
058:52:45|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. Switch now, I'm on Ascent number 2 O<sub>2</sub> tank, Descent O<sub>2</sub> is closed.
058:52:53|C|Lousma|Roger, Fred.
058:53:39|T|CDR|Get rid of that?
058:54:01|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?
058:54:05|C|Lousma|Reading you 5 square, Jim. Go ahead.
058:54:09|T|CDR|Okay. I'm looking out of Fred's window. I see a lot of particles out there, but a lot of that stuff is still drifting away from us, so a lot of it is flashing in the local vicinity, and I don't recognize any constellations right now, in this particular attitude.
058:54:34|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. If that status changes, please let us know.
058:54:41|T|CDR|Roger. We're continuing to drift. Okay, both TTCAs are up?
058:54:54|T|LMP|TTCA ...
058:55:08|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius; Houston. I've got some circuit breakers you can open to power down displays. In addition, I have a P30 maneuver PAD. Over.
058:55:20|T|CDR|Roger. Stand by, Houston. Get the CS - get the PAD book.
058:55:28|T|LMP|Get the LM data - get the LM book.
058:55:32|T|CDR|And, say - We're getting the PAD book now, Jack - and say the boost on powered up?
058:55:38|C|Lousma|Okay. I have some circuit breakers that you can open up in order to power down displays.
058:55:45|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by one, Jack. I'm going to get my comm carrier on, it's hard to hear  in here. 
058:55:50|T|CDR|Yes, no, no, get the Command Module PAD book.
058:55:54|T|CDR|All right, I'll tell you what. Get all the LM stuff. Give me the LM stuff right now. Jack, give me all the LM stuff.
058:56:45|T|CDR|Why?
058:57:06|T|CDR|All right, Jack. Hey, what do you need out of here ?
058:57:13|T|LMP|... status.
058:57:19|T|CDR|Here.
058:58:12|T|CDR|Now is there any way they can control this thing with the LM on? Freddo?
058:58:20|T|LMP|What's that?
058:58:21|T|CDR|Looks like I'm cross-coupling here. I might as well -
058:58:23|T|LMP|Yes, you are. TTCA will give you the best controlling authority.
058:58:30|T|CDR|Yes, and I want to get out of this roll. What if I go to -
058:58:42|T|LMP|It doesn't matter where the hell you are ... Gimbal lock ... my flashlight or any flashlight.
058:59:16|T|LMP|Do one now then power down the LM ...
058:59:34|T|CDR|Well, I'm not doing any good here.
058:59:38|T|LMP|Okay, how do you read now, Jack?
058:59:44|T|CDR|Omni.
058:59:46|T|LMP|Yes, we're on.
058:59:51|T|CDR|Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
058:59:54|T|LMP|Back on? Yes.
059:00:04|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. You're watching the middle gimbal there, aren't you? Go ahead, Aquarius.
059:00:12|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead with the breakers first, Jack.
059:00:15|C|Lousma|Okay. You watching your middle gimbal there?
059:00:20|T|CDR|Tell them we are.
059:00:24|T|LMP|Your attitude is just straight pitch down, Jim. Okay, you're moving away.
059:00:48|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred, I've got six circuit breakers for you.
059:00:54|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
059:00:56|C|Lousma|Okay, they're all on panel 11. Row 1 under AC Bus B, open Helium PQGS for Propellant Display.
059:01:07|T|CDR|It's Open.
059:01:08|T|LMP|Open.
059:01:09|C|Lousma|On row 2, Flight Displays, open Thrust, open Mission Timer, open Range/Range Rate, Altitude/Altitude Rate, and open the AC Bus A Range Rate, Altitude/Altitude Rate.
059:01:25|T|CDR|They're Open.
059:01:26|T|LMP|Okay. They're all Open.
059:01:27|C|Lousma|Okay. On row 4, PGNS, Signal Strength Display.
059:01:38|T|CDR|It's Open.
059:01:39|T|LMP|It's Open.
059:01:42|C|Lousma|Okay. That concludes the powerdown of displays. And I have a P30 PAD for you.
059:01:53|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
059:01:57|C|Lousma|Okay. The purpose is a pericynthion plus 2 hours DPS abort. Noun 33: 079:25:26.48; plus 1633.0, minus 0014.5, minus 0751.5; apogee not applicable, perigee is plus 0020.5; 1797.7, 8:35, 268, 264, plus 16410, minus 00145, minus 07338. COAS is NA. And I have two gimbal trim angles for you which will be updated. Right now, however, we want you to go with pitch 5.86, roll 6.75. Over.
059:03:37|T|LMP|What was that for?
059:03:40|T|CDR|Pitch and yaw, maybe, huh?
059:03:42|T|LMP|Okay, what was the last two things you gave me, a pitch and roll angle for what?
059:03:47|C|Lousma|That's for your DPS trim.
059:03:48|T|CDR|Those were gimbal angles for - pitch and yaw.
059:03:54|T|LMP|Oh, Roger. GDAs.
059:03:56|C|Lousma|Yes, that's what I mean. Sorry.
059:03:58|T|LMP|Pericynthion plus 2 - Okay, DPS pericynthion plus 2, at 079:25:026.48; plus 1633.0, minus 0014.5, minus 0751.5; HA N slash A, HP plus 0020.5; 1797.7, 8:35, 268, 264, plus 16410, minus 00145, minus 07338 -
059:04:43|T|CDR|Did we lose the water in the -
059:04:44|T|LMP|- N slash A in the COAS, and you gave me GDA angles of pitch 5.86, and you want roll 6.75.
059:04:56|C|Lousma|Good readback, Fred.
059:05:00|T|CDR|Yes, lose - get all the little bags you can with water.
059:05:06|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Say again, please.
059:05:13|T|LMP|Okay. We didn't answer back there, Jack. Check to see if you're on VOX.
059:05:19|T|CDR|No.
059:05:22|T|LMP|Neither am I, okay. Why the hell are we maneuvering at all now? Are we still venting?
059:05:34|T|CDR|Well, we're at Att Hold for one thing - I mean, we're at Minimum Impulse.
059:05:38|T|LMP|No, I mean why can't you null them out, somewhere?
059:05:41|T|CDR|Every time I try to - I can't take that doggone roll out. I got to wait until they get around to the bellyband.
059:05:50|T|LMP|Wait a minute. Do you - you fight roll by using the TTCA left right. That's what you need to play with.
059:06:04|T|CDR|Okay. We'll try that. Let me get around though. Let's roll. Let it roll all the way.
059:06:12|T|LMP|Yes, you can't let it roll all the way.
059:06:13|T|CDR|I know. I know. But I mean -
059:06:16|T|LMP|Okay. Then until it's upside down at least, huh?
059:06:18|T|CDR|Yes.
059:06:19|T|LMP|Okay. Well, should I ask him what the return time on that one is? Or are you interested?
059:06:31|T|CDR|Let's get the first things first.
059:06:43|T|LMP|Oh, you don't want to hear. Let me figure some times out here. That's at 79, and what are we at now? About - do we - do we - do we even know any better computer time, do we?
059:06:57|T|LMP|No.
059:07:00|T|LMP|Hey, Jack. Do you still have a mission timer? You don't? Okay.
059:07:07|T|CDR|I'll tell you what. Let's ask - let's ask Houston to give us a mission timer, computer time. They can up link it to us. Okay, hold it.
059:07:18|T|LMP|Go ahead.
059:07:20|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
059:07:21|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
059:07:25|T|CDR|You know, we don't have a - I don't think we have a computer clock going, and why don't you up link that stuff to us?
059:07:31|C|Lousma|Roger.
059:07:40|C|Lousma|And, Freddo, I got some circuit breakers on panel 16 for you.
059:07:49|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
059:07:51|C|Lousma|Okay. On row 1 under Flight Displays, Systems Engineer's Crosspointer, Open. Under RCS B -
059:08:00|T|LMP|It's Open.
059:08:01|C|Lousma|Open the Temp/Press Display-Flags and PQGS/Displays.
059:08:10|T|LMP|Okay. They're both Open.
059:08:12|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. On row 3 under Comm, open Displays and under ECS, open Displays.
059:08:25|T|LMP|Okay. Comm Displays, ECS Displays, both Open.
059:08:28|C|Lousma|Okay. And two more. In row 4 under Heaters, open Displays and under EPS, open Displays.
059:08:40|T|LMP|Okay. Heaters Display, EPS Display Open. And I've long since had all the lights off, floods, et cetera.
059:08:55|T|CDR|Where are those bags? Where are those bags for weighing water in the PLSS?
059:09:02|T|LMP|Why?
059:09:03|T|CDR|We're going to fill up Command Module water. We'll loose it ...
059:09:09|T|LMP|Hell, do you need a QD [clipped] Jim. No way to get ours in there. I don't think.
059:09:37|T|LMP|Hey, Jim.
059:09:44|T|CDR|I wonder if one of our water ... jet is. Okay, let's control - What else can we fill up there?
059:10:00|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston.
059:10:02|T|LMP|We're not - we're not going to -
059:10:03|C|Lousma|We're not going to be able to up link your time because of the IU, and we have a frequency problem there. But what I'd like to do is give you a time to set up on your mission timer and give you a mark and then you can put it into the DSKY from there. Over.
059:10:25|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by.
059:10:27|T|LMP|Wait a minute. Why do we need a mission timer right now, anyway? I mean, that bad, they'd tell us.
059:10:32|T|CDR|Well, I'd rather have a timer going so that we - what are we going to put in the DSKY? Should we shut down the mission timer?
059:10:37|T|LMP|Is that what you want to do?
059:10:38|T|CDR|Yes. Hey, Omni.
059:10:43|T|LMP|Great.
059:10:47|T|CDR|Switch them. Okay. Let's fire on the mission timer.
059:10:59|C|Lousma|Aquarius, we need Forward Omni.
059:11:05|T|CDR|Forward Omni.
059:11:07|T|LMP|Say again, Jack.
059:11:09|T|CDR|Forward Omni.
059:11:11|T|LMP|I am. Okay, Houston. If that call was an Omni switch, I'm in Forward now.
059:11:28|T|CDR|Okay, Freddo, how do I get the mission timer up? I got the mission timer cranked in.
059:11:34|T|LMP|You got it on?
059:11:35|T|CDR|I got the mission timer circuit breaker in.
059:11:38|T|LMP|Okay. We're going to probably need Numerics Lighting. There you go. You got it.
059:11:47|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. I think we've got a better way of getting your mission time up.
059:11:56|T|CDR|Go ahead with it.
059:11:59|C|Lousma|Okay. We can do a Verb 55, Enter, and then put an R1, minus 00088. In R2, minus 00059; R3 minus 03274.
059:12:28|T|LMP|Watch the crapping attitude.
059:12:31|T|CDR|We're okay.
059:12:36|T|LMP|God damn. I wish you'd get to something I know.
059:12:41|T|CDR|Well, as soon as we get over here, we'll stop it with the TTCA.
059:12:43|T|LMP|Okay.
059:12:46|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius; Houston. We've got you both on VOX.
059:12:54|T|LMP|Like to go what?
059:12:56|T|CDR|You want us on VOX, Jack?
059:12:58|C|Lousma|We have you on VOX. We're reading you loud and clear and the clock took good.
059:13:17|T|LMP|Okay. Looks like we're on the FDA route there, Jack.
059:13:39|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. How do you read me on Normal Voice now?
059:13:42|C|Lousma|Reading you 5 square, Fred.
059:13:46|T|LMP|Okay.
059:14:12|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, we're ready for a Verb 74 when you can give it to us.
059:14:23|T|LMP|You got it.
059:14:25|C|Lousma|Okay. And one other thing we noticed. When you pressurized the RCS, we got an increase in pressure in the ascent tanks, and so we want to have you verify that the ascent feeds are closed. In order to do that, on panel 11, close the Ascent Feed 1 and 2 circuit breakers on - and cycle the Parker valves, and then open the Ascent Feed circuit breakers on panel 11.
059:15:08|T|CDR|Completed, Houston.
059:15:10|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. Thank you.
059:17:53|T|LMP|And, Jack, Aquarius. What kind of return time is this maneuver given?
059:18:02|C|Lousma|That puts you back in the water at 133 hours.
059:18:11|T|LMP|133, hey.
059:18:13|C|Lousma|Affirm.
059:18:24|C|Lousma|And that's an Atlantic landing site.
059:18:31|T|LMP|Atlantic landing?
059:18:36|C|Lousma|Affirmative. That's the PAD that we've given you, but we may change our mind later on. We want you to have this info for now. And that's a minimum -
059:18:47|T|LMP|Okay.
059:18:48|C|Lousma|- minimun time return.
059:20:09|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We've got to change the REFSMMAT to the one to which you're aligned. So we'd like to have P00 and DATA and we'll ship that up to you.
059:20:21|T|CDR|Roger.
059:20:30|T|LMP|Okay, you got it, Jack.
059:20:34|C|Lousma|Roger. Coming up.
059:21:22|C|Lousma|Aquarius, could you give us DATA please?
059:21:32|T|CDR|Okay, Jack, you got it.
059:21:33|T|LMP|- the updata link, the DUA breaker may not be in, Jack.
059:21:44|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred, and close the DUA breaker.
059:21:51|T|CDR|It's in now, Jack.
059:21:54|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim, and it's coming up now. Thank you.
059:28:03|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We're finished with the uplink. The computer is yours. We'd like to power down the DUA, so pull the DUA circuit breaker please.
059:36:25|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to have Aft Omni, and we're going to lose contact with you for about a minute here while we try to establish tracking. And our latest data shows that your closest approach to the Moon is going to be 60 miles perigee. Over.
059:36:44|T|LMP|Okay. Closest approach, 60 miles, and I'm sitting on Aft Omni now.
059:36:50|C|Lousma|Roger. We'll probably be going off the air here in about a minute.
059:41:12|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. Over.
059:41:14|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
059:41:19|T|CDR|Okay. We're thinking about rigging up the urine dump to the side hatch. We're thinking about rigging up the urine dump to the side hatch and save urine heater power. What do you think?
059:41:36|C|Lousma|Stand by one.
059:41:42|T|CDR|Better still so we won't freeze up our urine dump.
059:41:48|C|Lousma|Roger. That sounds like a good plan, Jim. Why don't you go ahead with that one?
059:42:59|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. And down here we're getting regrouped, trying to work on your control modes and trying to set up something for PTC and taking a look at consumables as opposed to Flight Plan, and so forth, and as soon as we get all that information, we'll pass it up to you. We also have the 14 backup crew over in the simulators looking at dock burns and also trying to see what kind of alignment procedures they can come up with for looking at stars out the window. So if you ever are able to see any stars out there and think you can do an alignment out the window, why let us know.
059:43:40|T|CDR|Okay. Jack, right now we're not able to. The sunlight's reflecting off the thrusters and whatever debris came away at the time of the mishap is still with us, such that the stars are hard to find, and why - what respect do you want us to do the stars out the window - just to check the LMS run, is that correct?
059:44:04|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. We'd like to correlate the information we get with yours, so that if we can use it to update the platform, we can.
059:44:20|C|Lousma|What we're really trying to do, Jim, is see if we can do a COAS align so we can power down the platform.
059:45:23|T|LMP|That is Aquarius. We're getting an awful lot of static on the uplink now, and we're not reading you at all.
059:45:39|T|LMP|I have good signal strength and I'm on Aft Omni.
059:45:51|C|Lousma|How do you read now, Aquarius?
059:47:06|C|Young|Hey, Jim, do you suppose that you could orient the LM so that the Service Module would be between you and the Sun? I believe you could see - recognize constellations out your front windows then.
059:47:47|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Radio check.
059:48:15|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. How do you read now?
059:48:17|C|Lousma|Okay. Hearing you 5 square now, Jim. And the question we have, is there some way you can orient the spacecraft so that the Service Module is between the LM and the Sun so you can recognize constellations out the window? And secondly, can you see anything out the AOT?
059:49:28|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
059:51:19|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control; 59 hours, 51 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; continuing to stand by as we go through momentary loss of communication as the antennas and the spacecraft attitude drift past the point at which the ground tracking stations can receive from the spacecraft antennas. To back up and recap the earlier maneuver PAD, or information regarding Descent Propulsion System abort for minimum return time - this maneuver, should it be done, would come at 79 hours, 25 minutes, 26 seconds Ground Elapsed Time; at an altitude above the Moon of 205 nautical miles. The maneuver would be 1,797.7 feet per second posigrade; burn time of 8 minutes, 35 seconds; would produce entry interface at about 133 hours Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 13 is now 185,455 nautical miles [343,463 km] out from Earth; velocity showing on the display here in Mission Control, 3,118 feet per second [950 m/s]. The spacecraft crew aboard Aquarius and Odyssey are now powering down, carefully husbanding all of the consumables aboard the spacecraft. We're continuing to stand by at 59 hours, 53 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
059:53:46|C|Lousma|Aquarius, how do you read me now?
059:56:56|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
059:57:08|C|Lousma|Aquarius, request Forward Omni, please.
059:58:22|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Request Forward Omni. How do you read?
059:59:06|T|LMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?
059:59:09|C|Lousma|Hello there, Aquarius. Loud and clear. How do you read me?
059:59:14|T|CDR|There's an awful lot of background -
059:59:16|T|LMP|We get a lot of background static, Jack. You're down in the mud. You having a ground problem?
059:59:23|C|Lousma|What we tried to do was to get the IU frequency shifted off a little bit so that we'd have less interference. I think it'll come up - What we want you to do is turn on your descent oxygen and turn off your ascent oxygen. Over. And request Forward Omni.
059:59:43|T|LMP|You're unreadable, Jack. We've got our signal strength meter - right now it keeps wavering up and down, and the best I'm getting is about 2.4 AGC.
059:59:53|C|Lousma|Roger. Request Forward Omni.
059:59:58|T|LMP|I am on Forward Omni. I've been on Forward Omni.
060:00:43|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read, Jack?
060:00:46|C|Lousma|I'm hearing you 5 square, Fred. How me?
060:01:13|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston, How do you read.
060:01:58|T|LMP|Okay. We're up to about 2.6 AGC now.
060:02:03|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Radio check.
060:02:10|T|LMP|Okay. Every time you Transmit, Jack, the AGC starts to drop off and the static level cranks up.
060:02:18|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. You're loud and clear.
060:02:24|T|LMP|I wish you were.
060:02:30|C|Lousma|Fred, go to Descent O<sub>2</sub>.
060:02:35|T|LMP|Descent O<sub>2</sub>. Roger.
060:04:05|T|CDR|Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
060:04:08|C|Lousma|Hello there, Aquarius. How do you read me now?
060:04:23|T|CDR|Hello, Houston. Aquarius.
060:04:26|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Go.
060:04:30|T|CDR|Okay. That's the first clear word we heard from you, Jack. Do you think it could be my pitch attitude that's breaking up your incoming? I guess you've been hearing us.
060:04:42|C|Lousma|We have been hearing you, and the problem is on the ground. I hope we have it corrected now.
060:04:51|T|CDR|Okay. That sounds good.
060:04:53|C|Lousma|We're considering powering down the PGNS but we want to know what capability you have to do a coarse and fine align. We read your conversation about being unable to see out the window very good. How about out the AOT?
060:05:26|T|LMP|He's looking now.
060:05:29|C|Lousma|Okay. And the other thing we thought you might try is to put the Service Module between you and the Sun and then to see if you can see anything out the window in that attitude.
060:05:43|C|Young|The reason that we think that that would work is that it worked on Apollo 10. It made the constellations all recognizable when we put the the Service Module - in our case a LM, between us and the Sun.
060:06:00|C|Lousma|Aft Omni, Fred.
060:06:07|T|LMP|You're down in the mud again, Jack. It appears that some other circuit is feeding through on there with you.
060:06:14|C|Lousma|Roger. Aft Omni.
060:06:30|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. John Young sitting in at the Capcom console with Jack Lousma giving the benefit of his experience in Apollo 10.
060:06:42|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Aft Omni.
060:07:29|T|LMP|Okay. You're down in the mud again, Jack. Lots of background static.
060:08:10|C|Lousma|Aft Omni, Aquarius.
060:09:00|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston.
060:11:18|T|LMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?
060:18:21|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
060:21:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control; 60 hours, 21 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. At the present time, the Flight Dynamics Officer here in Mission Control is computing a maneuver to place Apollo 13 back on a free return trajectory within the next hour. The maneuver would likely come at about 61 hours Ground Elapsed Time. The Lunar Module Primary Guidance and Navigation System, so-called 'pings', will be left powered up for the next hour, and then powered down to conserve water, which is used for cooling the electronics in the system. We'll stand by as this next maneuver is generated and passed up to the crew. Having some communications problem as the spacecraft drifts through the various Omni antenna look angles. The High Gain Antenna has not been powered up, to conserve the electrical power. At 60 hours, 22 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, standing by; this is Apollo Control.
060:22:46|T|LMP|Hello, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?
060:22:48|C|Lousma|Hello, there, Aquarius. Loud and clear. How me, now?
060:22:54|T|CDR|Okay, we're reading you loud and clear, Jack. I hope it stays this time.
060:22:58|C|Lousma|Okay. We'd like to brief you on what our plan is. We're, at this time, water critical in the LM. So we'd like to use as little as possible. To do this, we're going to plan to make a free return maneuver of 16 feet per second at 61 hours, which is 37 minutes from now. Then we're going to power down the PGNS, and then we'll - at 79 hours, we'll go ahead and make another abort maneuver to kick what we got. But we'd like to get that PGNS powered down as soon as possible. That would be after the midcourse and - so how do you feel about making a 16-foot-per-second burn in 37 minutes?
060:23:49|T|CDR|Well, we'll give it a try, Jack, if that's all we've got. That's a 16-foot-per-second DPS burn in 37 minutes?
060:23:57|C|Lousma|Roger. We're working up a PAD for it, but we'd want to know what you think about doing it at that time.
060:24:08|T|CDR|Well, we'll do it. Could you give us a little bit more time?
060:24:30|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. We'd like to get a suggested time from you. We can figure out a free-return maneuver for any time you want to give us, so if you'll give us the time you'd like to shoot for, we'll figure out a PAD.
060:24:47|T|CDR|Okay, that sounds good. I think if we have a little bit more time; we want to do it right. Stand by one.
060:25:04|T|CDR|Let's shoot for an hour if we can, Jack. How's that.
060:25:15|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. How about 61 hours and 30 minutes? That's an hour and 5 from now.
060:25:24|T|CDR|Okay. We'll do it and we want to be sure we talk back and forth now to make sure we get this burn off right.
060:25:31|C|Lousma|Affirm.
060:25:35|T|LMP|Okay, in the interim, Jack, I looked around again and I saw that we have a radar and a landing radar heater breaker in. Can I pull those out?
060:25:46|C|Lousma|Affirmative. Pull them both out.
060:25:52|C|Lousma|And now we want to ask you a question about alignments, and so forth. We wanted to know if you can see any stars out of the AOT. We also wanted to know if you could use the Service Module to cast a shadow on the LM windows and then look out the windows to see stars for a P51 COAS alignment.
060:26:14|T|CDR|Okay, in this attitude, Jack, that we're pitching around, I cannot use the AOT to see stars. We - we're just not able to see them at all. Now we may be able to maneuver off in yaw or - and/or roll and see stars. Right now, we haven't been able to. The AOT is useless. The Command Module structure is just radiating too much light into the - into the telescope.
060:26:41|C|Lousma|Okay, and how about using the Service Module to cast a shadow on the commander's window? If you do that, can you see stars for a COAS alignment?
060:26:55|T|CDR|We could give that a try, Jack, although I don't know how successful it will be. We tried to do it - The light shines off our quads which makes it difficult to see stars. We do have the Earth and the Moon, if that can be of assistance.
060:27:18|T|LMP|Another problem - Right now, Jack, I'm looking out the right window and it's pretty dark out that window but there are about a thousand or so false stars out here from - left over from some of the debris. It's hard to discern what's real and not real.
060:27:38|C|Lousma|Okay. That's good information and during the time that we see you're continuing to pitch, if you ever get in a position where you think the AOT might be of some use, we'd like you to periodically look out of it and see if you can see some stars that would enable us to get a P52.
060:27:59|T|CDR|Okay, will do. And also, let me ask you a question. In this configuration, docked, we have to use the TTCA to control pitch and roll. And, just how much can we use that without really changing our trajectory? We only have 60 miles to play with.
060:28:21|C|Lousma|Roger, we'll put that to them.
060:28:45|T|LMP|Okay, Jack, are you ready to go to work with me on the 2-hour DPS activation and contingency book, page 1?
060:28:54|C|Lousma|Roger, we're ready to go.
060:29:05|T|LMP|Okay. Item one, we can - one through five, we can scratch off, as done. Is that correct?
060:29:14|C|Lousma|Stand by one, Fred.
060:30:18|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred, let's go ahead. Step 1, page 1. Everybody's listening.
060:30:28|T|LMP|Okay, I've looked around, and I've essentially done steps 1 through 5 with the exception of floodlights and utility lights and I think we'll just do without those.
060:30:40|C|Lousma|Roger. Your choice.
060:30:47|T|LMP|Okay, on EPS activation, we're through step - we're through that - bottom of that page. That's all done.
060:30:58|C|Lousma|We concur, page 2.
060:31:13|T|LMP|Okay, in essence, we've circumvented step 4, and we're not sitting with all 4 amps - descent BATs on high-voltage taps, so I'll scratch off step 4.
060:31:28|C|Lousma|Roger, and in step 5, we want to leave Inverter 1 circuit breaker, Open.
060:31:37|T|LMP|Roger. In step 5, we'll leave Inverter 1 CB, Open.
060:31:41|C|Lousma|Omit step 6.
060:31:53|T|LMP|Okay, for the time being, our mission timer is the computer so, mission timer activation scratch off.
060:32:05|C|Lousma|Roger.
060:32:09|T|LMP|Okay. We've done the primary glycol loop activation.
060:32:15|C|Lousma|We verify it.
060:32:29|C|Lousma|Aquarius, we recommend you leave the caution and warning off on page 3.
060:32:37|T|LMP|Okay. I was going to say that next. Page 3, we'll just scratch item 1. And item 2, I've already got the RCS heaters on. And I don't know if I gave you the time or you got the time on the Primary Evap Flow number 1, Open.
060:33:04|C|Lousma|We got the time.
060:33:10|T|LMP|Okay. Let's go to the CB pages now.
060:33:29|C|Lousma|Freddo, did you close the engine control breaker in panel 11?
060:33:38|T|LMP|What control is that, Jack?
060:33:40|C|Lousma|Did you close the S and C engine control breaker on panel 11? As we got step 1 there on page 3.
060:33:49|T|LMP|Okay. Okay, yes, the EPS Descent ECA Control breaker is Closed on 11.
060:34:00|C|Lousma|Roger, and how about the - on panel 11, S and C Engine Control, Closed? Aft Omni, Fred.
060:34:16|T|LMP|Okay. We're Aft Omni, and we have the S and C Engine Control breaker, Closed.
060:34:24|C|Lousma|Roger. Let's go on with the circuit breaker panel checkout.
060:34:34|T|LMP|Okay. I'll just give you - I think it'll be easier to give you what I got in. Okay, in the top row on 11, we have the four AC Bus Tie breakers, In, and the AC Bus Volts breaker, In, and that's it. Second row, we have the four TCA breakers, In. We have the GASTA under Flight Displays and Commander's FDAI. And likewise under AC Bus A, we have a GASTA and a Commander FDAI breaker, In. That's it. On row 3, we have a Signal Conditioner 1. We have the ATCA (PGNS). We have the Engine Control breaker, Attitude Direct Control breaker, and the - under Lighting, Anun/Dock/Component breaker, In. And one other; ED Logic Power A - ED Logic Power A is also In.
060:35:41|C|Lousma|Copy.
060:35:45|T|LMP|Okay, under the fourth - fourth row, we got all the Quad Heater breakers, In. Suit Fan 1. Under ECS, Glycol 1 and 2; and under Comm, we have Commander Audio, In, and PGNSs LGC/DSKY, IMU Standby, IMU Operate, and that's it. Okay, in the bottom row, EPS, we have the BAT Feed Tie both In, and we have the Cross Tie Balance Loads, In, the X Lunar Bus Tie, Descent ECA Control, Descent ECA, and the DC Bus Volts breaker.
060:36:38|C|Lousma|Roger. We copy.  -
060:36:38|T|LMP|That completes it for panel 11.
060:36:40|C|Lousma|Okay. Stand by.
060:36:45|T|LMP|Okay.
060:36:54|T|LMP|As I see it, some of the short ones are - we need the DECA GIMBAL, In, sooner or later.
060:37:00|C|Lousma|That's affirmed. Close the DECA Gimbal.
060:37:01|T|LMP|And probably - Okay, DECA Gimbal, and sooner or later, we're going to need DECA Power, I guess, also.
060:37:15|C|Lousma|All right, DECA Power will come up later in the procedure, Freddo.
060:37:21|T|LMP|Okay.
060:38:41|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. On your circuit breaker checklist, on panel 11 and 16, we want you to configure the panels as outlined in the checklist.
060:38:57|T|LMP|Okay. You want us to configure as per checklist. Okay. We'll do that.
060:39:03|C|Lousma|That's right. Close the black ones and open the white ones.
060:39:12|T|LMP|Yes. I think we can manage that.
060:39:19|T|CDR|With the activation power up, we're starting right now.
060:40:12|T|CDR|Houston, we might as well leave our RCS TCAs, In, right?
060:40:23|C|Lousma|Affirmative, Jim. Leave your RCS TCAs in -
060:40:26|T|LMP|Check that -
060:40:27|C|Lousma|- on panel 11.
060:40:30|T|LMP|- Yes. I used my Pentel pen and made those white ones black ones.
060:40:35|C|Lousma|Roger. Same on 16, Fred.
060:40:40|T|LMP|Roger.
060:40:46|T|CDR|And you might look there, Houston, to see what circuit breakers aren't required, like the tape recorder.
060:40:52|C|Lousma|We're looking.
060:41:41|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. On panel 11 over there, you can also leave open the Rendezvous Radar Heater breaker and the Landing Radar Heater breaker, in addition to the tape recorder.
060:41:55|T|CDR|They're out.
060:42:04|T|CDR|I'm leaving a few in, Jack, too, like the Suit Fan 1 is still in, RCS System is still In, the TCAs. Attitude Direct Control is In.
060:42:18|C|Lousma|Roger.
060:42:33|T|CDR|How about if I leave the VHF A and B Off?
060:42:41|T|LMP|Switch to Forward Omni.
060:42:53|C|Lousma|Okay. We can leave the VHF powered down, too.
060:43:01|T|CDR|And, do you want the Secondary S-Band?
060:43:04|C|Lousma|Negative on Secondary S-Band. Leave them open.
060:43:13|T|CDR|Up Data Link is In. Do you want that in or out?
060:43:21|C|Lousma|Leave the Up Data Link open. We'll call for it when we want you to put it in.
060:44:01|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control; 60 hours, 44 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Distance from Earth, 187,006 miles [346,335 km]; velocity, 3,089 feet per second [942 m/s]. Flight dynamics people still computing the midcourse correction to go back to a free return trajectory. Here in Mission Control the coffee cup has become a appliance second only to the headset in usefulness here.
060:44:36|T|LMP|Okay, Jack, on panel 11 on the top row, do you really want the Propulsion PQGS and Ascent Helium REGs in?
060:44:54|T|LMP|And, also the System Engineer X-Pointer breaker.
060:44:59|C|Lousma|Roger. Negative on the PQGS. Negative on the Ascent Helium REG, and negative on the Crosspointer.
060:45:17|T|LMP|Okay. On the second row, I'm going to leave the Floodlight breaker open.
060:45:24|C|Lousma|Concur.
060:45:31|T|LMP|And we're again up to - Do you want the CWEA enabled?
060:45:39|C|Lousma|Negative on the CWEA.
060:45:44|T|LMP|Okay.
060:46:02|T|LMP|Okay. Since we're - are we going to power up the AGS or should I concern myself with the ATCA breaker?
060:46:14|C|Lousma|Negative on the AGS. However, Fred, we need the ATCA breaker in.
060:46:28|T|LMP|Okay. ATCA breakers In. Yes. I guess for the backup power supply. Hey, how about ATCA AGS.
060:46:43|C|Lousma|Negative on ATCA AGS.
060:47:05|T|LMP|And I'm leaving the Suit Flow Control breaker open.
060:47:20|C|Lousma|Let's close the Suit Flow Control breaker -
060:47:22|T|CDR|And, Jack, I'm yawing now.
060:47:23|C|Lousma|- so it doesn't take any current.
060:47:30|T|LMP|Okay. Without suits, it doesn't do us much good either though.
060:47:52|T|LMP|Okay. And are we going to continue to be able to operate off the Omnis, Jack. So can I leave the S-band antenna powered down?
060:48:18|C|Lousma|Okay, Freddo. We don't plan to use the steerable antenna, although we want to leave the heaters on. So it looks you ought to open up Comm S-Band Antenna, but leave S-Band Antenna Heaters closed.
060:48:33|T|LMP|Roger. Comm S-Band is Open, S-Band Heater breaker is still Closed.
060:49:26|T|LMP|And, on the bottom row, Jack, I'm going to leave the Heater Display breaker out, which we had pulled before, and EPS Display. But I question, do we want the Ascent ECA breaker in, as prescribed?
060:49:47|C|Lousma|Stand by. That's a negative on the Ascent ECA breaker. Leave it open.
060:50:02|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, we need P00 and DATA -
060:50:04|T|CDR|And Jack -
060:50:05|C|Lousma|- and we'll give you state vector and target load.
060:50:12|T|LMP|Okay. We need the Uplink breaker in then now.
060:50:17|C|Lousma|That's affirmative.
060:50:23|T|CDR|Okay. And, Jack, will you give us that - how about the ORDEAL breaker? Can I pull that? We don't need that, do we?
060:50:32|C|Lousma|Negative on the ORDEAL. Leave it open.
060:50:48|T|LMP|And how about the Ascent ECA breaker on panel 11? Jim has it in over there.
060:51:02|C|Lousma|And panel 11 Ascent ECA can be open.
060:51:07|T|CDR|It's open.
060:51:27|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. We're Go on the circuit breaker configuration as you have it now.
060:51:36|T|LMP|Roger.
060:52:04|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, tests in the simulator just showed that if you want to let the PGNS DAP hold your attitude for you, it will.
060:52:16|T|CDR|Okay, very well.
060:52:30|T|CDR|And, Jack, because it will take quite a while to get back to the attitude, I think we ought to think about going there very shortly.
060:52:37|C|Lousma|Roger. I have a PAD for you. I have a P30 maneuver PAD.
060:52:48|T|CDR|Roger. Stand by.
060:52:53|T|CDR|... -
060:52:54|T|LMP|Go right ahead, Jack.
060:52:58|C|Lousma|Okay. We want you to hold your maneuver until we finish making the load. We haven't completed it yet. Are you ready to copy P30 maneuver PAD?
060:53:07|T|CDR|That's affirm.
060:53:09|C|Lousma|Okay. Here we go. The purpose is midcourse correction for free return. Noun 33: 061:29:42.84; minus 0021.3, plus 0004.1, minus 0031.2; H<sub>A</sub> and H<sub>P</sub> are N/A; Delta-V, 0038.0; 031, 120, 298, minus 00213, plus 00041, minus 00312; COAS, NA. And I have your LM GDA angles. Pitch 5.86, roll 6.75. Your DPS throttling, 5 seconds at 10 percent, burn the rest at 40 percent. Your ullage will be two jets for 10 seconds.
060:54:57|T|LMP|Okay, Jack, we have a P30 maneuver PAD, a midcourse for free return. Noun 33: 061:29:42.84; minus 0021.3, plus 004.1, minus 0031.2; H<sub>A</sub> and H<sub>P</sub>, N/A; Delta-V<sub>R</sub>, 0038.0; 031, 120, 298; minus 00213, plus 00041, minus 00312. COAS, N/A; GDA angles; pitch 5.86, roll 6.75; DPS throttle, 5 seconds at 10 percent; burn the rest at 40 percent. And we need a two-jet, 10-second ullage.
060:56:02|C|Lousma|That's a good readback, Fred. I'd like to verify, however, in Noun 81, in V<sub>Y</sub>, it's plus three balls 41.
060:56:14|T|LMP|Okay. Noun 81, V<sub>Y</sub> is plus 0004.1.
060:56:21|C|Lousma|Good readback. Let's press on with the checklist.
060:56:27|T|CDR|Okay. And, Jack, find out about using TTCA to maneuver with.
060:56:32|C|Lousma|Okay. We're finished with the computer, it's yours, and we recommend using the TTCA to maneuver with.
060:56:41|T|CDR|Roger.
060:56:43|T|LMP|Okay, I'm back on the checklist, page 6. Jack, under PGNS turn-on and self-test. We've done everything except the self test here on this page. Do you want to do that at this time?
060:57:28|C|Lousma|Okay. Aquarius, negative on the PGNS self test. Page 7.
060:57:37|T|LMP|Okay. I'll scratch page 6 and on page 7, we're not going to activate the - or rather we had the S-band activated, ECS Activation I have all done. And, at the bottom of the page, the docked IMU coarse align is done.
060:58:03|C|Lousma|Roger.
060:58:14|T|LMP|We've - Okay, we've also completed, I guess in essence, all of page 8.
060:58:22|C|Lousma|That's affirmative and page 9 to boot. Scratch VHF. We've done the T<sub>ephems</sub>.
060:58:36|T|LMP|Okay. You've updated us, that's right. We cranked in the time.
060:58:52|T|CDR|And, Houston, let's go to activation - contingency page 10 and see what we desire.
060:58:58|C|Lousma|Okay. The only item on page 10 is to deploy the landing gear.
060:59:06|T|CDR|Okay, we'll do that now.
061:00:10|T|LMP|Okay. The landing gear are down and locked, Jack, and looking ahead now at page 11, we've done all of that.
061:00:24|C|Lousma|We verify that. Page 12.
061:00:31|T|LMP|Okay, and I assume in amongst all those numbers you pumped up, we got a REFSMMAT and State Vector. Is that correct?
061:00:39|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. You've got that. So you can delete page 12.
061:00:52|T|LMP|Hey, on 13, you've read us up the fine align angles and we've cranked those in.
061:01:01|C|Lousma|Affirmative.
061:01:08|T|LMP|Okay, so now we're up to - we've got to do DAP set, the gimbal/throttle test.
061:01:13|C|Lousma|That's - Okay, Aquarius. We recommend omitting the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test - just make sure the gim - DECA Power and DECA Gimbal circuit breakers are closed.
061:01:33|T|LMP|Okay, we're going to proceed now with the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test, is that correct? Or did you say delete it?
061:01:40|C|Lousma|Aquarius, delete the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test. Just ensure that the DECA Power and the DECA GIMBAL are closed.
061:01:49|T|CDR|Okay. Houston, DECA Power is Open at this time. Do you want me to close it?
061:01:54|C|Lousma|Affirmative, Jim. Close the DECA Power.
061:02:00|T|CDR|It's Closed. We deleted that.
061:02:27|T|LMP|Okay. Also out of that list, Jack, we need the Commander's Throttle set to Throttle and Min.
061:02:58|T|LMP|Houston, if I recall the launch set of the gimbals, the GDAs are not correct here, and where are we going to get those set for the burn?
061:03:14|C|Lousma|Stand by one.
061:03:33|C|Lousma|Okay. Here's the word on the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test. Let's do step 1 and step 2, and that'll get our gimbal set.
061:03:50|T|LMP|Roger.
061:04:20|T|LMP|Okay, Jack, we're going to have to back up on this, if we're going to follow the procedure here, which has us go Mode Control; PGNS, Auto, we're going to have to pull the TCA breakers to keep from firing jets.
061:04:53|C|Lousma|Stand by, Fred.
061:05:28|C|Lousma|Stand by on step 1, Fred. We're getting the word for you. How do you like this SIM?
061:05:42|T|LMP|It's a beauty.
061:06:09|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius, we recommend you do the DAP set and gimbal/throttle test as per the checklist. Go PGNS Auto and proceed.
061:06:21|T|CDR|Well, we're going to fire our thrusters as soon as we go to Auto because we've got those thrusters in - the thruster circuit breakers. Do you want us to do that and stop?
061:06:50|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius, we're recommending you go to Auto. Let the thrusters fire and settle down and proceed with the test.
061:07:06|T|CDR|We're in PGNS Auto.
061:07:09|C|Lousma|Roger, your DAP is set, you're in wide deadband. That ought to do the trick.
061:07:15|T|CDR|Roger.
061:07:19|C|Lousma|Okay, we're looking at it, Aquarius. We're ready to proceed with the test.
061:07:26|T|LMP|Okay, we're proceeding.
061:07:52|T|LMP|Okay, and Houston, you - you're looking at the weights now. Those are still good, right?
061:08:01|C|Lousma|You're Go on the weights.
061:09:05|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to recycle on the DAP load and change your DAP to 32021. Over.
061:10:35|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've got an ignition countdown clock running here now in Control Center showing 19 minutes, 19 seconds to ignition on the midcourse correction which will place Apollo 13 back on a free return trajectory. To recap the details of this maneuver, the ignition time would be at 61 hours, 29 minutes, 42 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. The velocity change would be 38 feet per second (11.6 m/s). Burn time, 30.7 seconds.
061:11:05|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. We're looking at your gimbal and we notice that we got a four-jet ullage loaded in the DAP and we gave you two jets on the PAD. But, let's go with what we've got loaded. It'll be a four-jet ullage.
061:11:18|T|LMP|Okay.
061:11:27|P|PAO|During this maneuver using the Descent Propulsion System, the throttle will be at 10 percent for the first 5 seconds of the burn and throttle up for the balance of the burn at 40 percent.
061:11:40|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. How does the GDAs look now?
061:11:45|C|Lousma|The GDAs are Go as they are. Press on.
061:12:09|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, we're going to do the DPS pressurization and checkout.
061:12:16|C|Lousma|Stand by one.
061:12:34|C|Lousma|Okay, your gimbals are within 0.3 and we're ready for the DPS pressurization and checkout.
061:13:33|T|LMP|Okay, Houston, do you want to follow up on page 15 with RCS checkout? In essence, we've kind of already done that.
061:13:47|C|Lousma|You're right, Aquarius. Let's delete the RCS checkout. And a DPS looks Go.
061:15:43|T|CDR|Houston, we're going to do a PGNS Auto maneuver to the attitude.
061:15:49|C|Lousma|Stand by on that. Aquarius, we recommend driving it around there manually with a TTCA.
061:15:58|T|CDR|Okay, we'll have to use the TTCA. Roger.
061:21:10|T|CDR|We're going to Auto now, Houston, to try to damp the rates. We're at the attitude.
061:21:22|C|Lousma|Roger, Jim. We verify the attitude.
061:21:27|T|CDR|Roger.
061:23:37|T|LMP|And, Houston, we'd like to confirm, do you want the Verb 65 Enter in there?
061:23:45|C|Lousma|Affirmative on the Verb 65.
061:23:49|T|LMP|Okay.
061:24:12|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. I got another question on page 18. At 1 minute, I concur with Master Arm, On, but I wonder why I have to have the Abort Stage breaker in. We sure don't want any staging now.
061:24:38|C|Lousma|Aquarius, delete the Abort Stage circuit breaker Close. Leave it open.
061:24:46|T|LMP|Roger. Will delete.
061:24:55|T|LMP|Okay. Also, Jack, since we have four-jet ullage versus two, do you want - still want 10 seconds ullage or do you want 5 now?
061:25:09|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius, we'll use automatic ullage.
061:25:18|T|LMP|Okay. We'll just let the 7&frac12;-second Auto ullage do it.
061:25:23|C|Lousma|Roger, and we'd like to do this in manual throttle, so on page 17 about two-thirds of the way down, Throttle Control, Manual, vice Auto.
061:25:35|T|LMP|Okay. We're set to Manual.
061:25:58|T|CDR|What's the 203 question?
061:26:05|C|Lousma|Enter on the 203, Jim.
061:26:11|T|CDR|We've got 203 in the DSKY now and it looks as though it requires work, can we pass it?
061:26:16|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Enter on the 203.
061:26:22|T|CDR|We have ENTERED.
061:26:51|C|Lousma|Aquarius, we'd like to verify that your throttle is in the Min position.
061:26:58|T|CDR|That's affirm.
061:27:00|C|Lousma|And, in the event that you have to do a manual takeover, turn the Engine Gimbal Off, Mode Control to Attitude Hold, and use the hand - use the TTCA.
061:27:16|T|CDR|Roger.
061:28:14|T|LMP|Okay, 1 plus 30 to burn.
061:28:20|C|Lousma|Roger.
061:28:45|T|LMP|Okay, Master Arm's On; 1 minute.
061:28:53|C|Lousma|Roger, Aquarius. You're Go for the burn.
061:29:55|T|CDR|40 percent.
061:30:04|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. You're looking good.
061:30:25|T|CDR|Auto shutdown.
061:30:40|T|LMP|Okay. You're looking at 16 85 now, Jack.
061:30:46|C|Lousma|Okay. You're Go in the residuals, proceed.
061:30:55|T|LMP|Okay. When you say Go on the residuals, you mean don't trim them. Is that right?
061:31:00|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. No trim required.
061:31:06|T|CDR|Roger.
061:31:08|T|LMP|Okay.
061:32:17|C|Lousma|Aquarius, check your Master Arm, Off, please.
061:32:44|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Burn's complete. Now we have to talk about powerdown, and what do you want us to do with the PGNS?
061:32:52|C|Lousma|Roger. We're looking at that right now, and you'll be the first one to get the word.
061:33:19|T|CDR|And, Houston, it's doubtful right now whether we'll be able to see the stars in this configuration. The only way we could possibly get alignment is with the Earth and the terminator or the Moon and its terminator and I'd sure like to have you look at a powerdown - keeping the PGNS if at all possible.
061:33:49|C|Lousma|Roger, Jim. We'll get the word for you.
061:35:24|T|CDR|And, Houston, we're in an Att Hold mode, can we turn off the buses?
061:35:40|C|Lousma|Stand by on that one, Jim.
061:38:13|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. We're working on what's going to happen next. In the meantime, we'd like to take some high-power items off the line, so on panel 11, open DECA Power, and open DECA Gimbal. On 16, open the ATCA breaker.
061:38:36|T|LMP|Okay, on 11, we got DECA Power, DECA Gimbal, Open. On 16, we got the ATCA breaker Open.
061:39:37|T|CDR|And, Houston, while you're thinking, see if you can come up with a procedure of perhaps using the Command Module optics with manual drive to perhaps look for stars.
061:39:51|C|Lousma|Roger.
061:41:24|T|CDR|And, Jack, Aquarius. While you're thinking - before we had our Comm problems, we were wanting to know what to - whether we should hook up the side hatch urine dump system. So we wouldn't freeze up the normal urine dump system.
061:41:45|C|Lousma|Roger. We gave you a Go on that earlier. Sorry, you must have missed it. Use the side hatch for urine dump.
061:41:54|T|CDR|Okay.
061:41:56|C|Lousma|And, how are the stars out the window now?
061:42:13|T|CDR|Well, I'll look again, Jack, but at this attitude, the Sun is reflecting off of - off of quad 4 so bright that it's ruining any night vision and we still got particles floating around us; I'll have to take a long look and see if I can see any star patterns.
061:42:34|C|Lousma|Roger.
061:42:44|C|Lousma|And Aquarius, we're going to have to hand you over to a different site now, and we think maybe things will work better if this time we turn off the S-band Transmitter/receiver, and bring it back up in 5 minutes. You copy?
061:42:59|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by one.
061:43:10|T|CDR|Okay. I understand you want us to turn off the S-band Transmitter/receiver and bring it up in 5 minutes. Is that correct?
061:43:15|C|Lousma|That's affirmative.
061:43:20|T|CDR|Tell us when.
061:43:42|T|CDR|And you want us to maintain attitude control.
061:43:46|C|Lousma|Affirmative on the attitude control.
061:43:48|T|CDR|That's auto attitude control. Okay. You maintain auto attitude control.
061:43:56|T|LMP|Okay, Jack, I'm back on the line now. On the S-band, you want me to turn off the Transmitter/ receiver and the power amps are off for 5 minutes. Is that - when you give me the word - is that what you want?
061:44:10|C|Lousma|Aquarius, leave the power amplifier the way it is. Turn the Transmitter/Receiver off for 5 minutes. Now.
061:44:19|T|LMP|Okay. You tell me - you tell me when.
061:44:22|C|Lousma|Okay. Turn it off now. See you in 5 minutes.
061:44:26|T|LMP|Okay. It's gone off. It's gone off for 5 minutes.
061:45:09|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 61 hours, 45 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The process of handing over from the Goldstone station to the Honeysuckle station in Australia. There will be a gap of about 5 minutes while this handover is taking place. Meanwhile the people here in Mission Control Center are looking at ways of setting up some sort of scheme for passing thermal control or Bar-B-Que mode of thermal balance for the spacecraft, during the remainder of the coasting flight using the abort guidance system of the Lunar Module to provide the attitude control to set up this slow roll. Apollo 13 now 188,863 nautical miles [349,774 km] out from Earth; velocity, 3,084 feet per second [940 m/s]. At 61 hours, 46 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
061:52:44|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
061:52:52|T|LMP|Okay. You're loud and clear there, Jack.
061:52:54|C|Lousma|Roger. Same here. We're - We're still discussing the next move.
061:53:04|T|LMP|I figured it. Let's just make it a good one.
061:53:18|C|Lousma|We're looking real close at water usage profiles, and right now things are kind of swinging toward leaving the IMU powered up and powering down the LGC, but we'll have more word for you shortly. And we recommend for sleeping that you leave one guy on watch. We recommend you don't make any urine dumps if you can help it, because it'll make the debris problem worse than it is now. And we have some items that you might want to transfer to the LM, some towels, some penlights, fecal bags, UTS. And do you have any more items that we can help you out with at the moment?
061:54:17|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by on your latter list there, Jack. I understand no urine dumps. I guess we'll work through the UCD and all the bags we got; and real quick there, can you give a DAP load that we want in here now to conserve the RCS.
061:55:21|C|Lousma|Okay. For attitude control coordinates, we're recommending manual control Verb 76 and watch your middle gimbal angle. Your DAP load that you have now looks good.
061:55:37|T|LMP|Okay. It's Att Hold Verb 76 for the guy on watch. And the DAP load we got right now is okay.
061:58:17|C|Lousma|Aquarius, our decision for the time is to leave the IMU powered up, power down the LGC, and power down other nonessential items. We'll be coming up with a more precise checklist as soon as we can get it. Over.
061:58:36|T|LMP|Okay. The decision is to keep the platform, power down the computer, and we'll be standing by for further word on the powerdown, Jack.
061:58:47|C|Lousma|Roger.
061:59:33|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, for your information, we now have 136-mile [252 km] perigee. Confirmed by Doppler.
061:59:47|T|LMP|Okay. 136-mile perigee now. That's very nice.
062:00:09|T|LMP|Oh, wait a minute, Jack. Did you say pericynthion or perigee?
062:00:13|C|Lousma|I meant pericynthion.
062:00:18|T|LMP|Ah. That's better.
062:05:19|T|CDR|And, Houston, we pulled out your Updata Link circuit breaker, so if you want to update it for anything, let us know and we'll put it back in.
062:05:27|C|Lousma|Roger, Jim. We will.
062:09:41|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Aft Omni, please.
062:09:47|T|CDR|Aft Omni.
062:14:26|T|CMP|Houston, do you read Apollo 13?
062:14:30|C|Lousma|This is Houston. Go ahead. Reading you weakly.
062:14:36|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. We don't want to bug you, but you ought to be thinking - or what your thoughts are concerning what the next burn will be. I got to figure out a watch schedule and the sleep schedule and just how we can meet the next maneuver.
062:14:55|C|Lousma|Roger. We're getting you a Flight Plan update. We're still computing on your next burn, and we're getting ready to give you a procedure for powerdown.
062:16:34|C|Lousma|Aquarius, one idea on managing the Omni antennas. It might make it easier on everybody if we disabled the Uplink Squelch and managed the antennas by switching when we hear the noise. Over.
062:16:58|T|CDR|Roger. Will do.
062:24:15|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control; 62 hours, 24 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Under discussion here in the control room are the various means by which the spacecraft thermal balance can be maintained through the night with a minimum amount of propellant and electrical usage. One man will be on watch in the crew throughout the night and they're looking at the possibility of manual control attitude to arrive at some sort of passive thermal control mode. Apollo 13 now 190,026 nautical miles [351,928 km] out; velocity, 3,064 feet per second [934 m/s]. At 62 hours, 25 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control.
062:26:07|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. Here's what we're going to do. We'd like you to point the LM X-axis either north or south. That's the positive X-axis. It appears to us that it would be closer to orient the LM plus X-axis toward the south. Do that with the LGC powered up using the TTCA. After that, we propose to power down the LGC to save some power. However, this means that we lose the use of the TTCA, and we'll have to control the spacecraft with the hand controller in the Direct mode. Request your - your position on these two items.
062:27:34|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
062:27:45|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. Understand. You want us to point the LM X - plus X-axis to the south using the TTCAs with the LGC powered up. Then, by powering down the LGC, we'll lose a TTCA. I wasn't too successful in controlling the spacecraft in attitude only, but I might be able to keep it out of gimbal lock.
062:28:14|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jim. We'd keep your ball powered up and go to Direct on the hand controller. And maintain attitude in a Direct position.
062:28:39|T|CDR|Okay. Understand; and do you want some sort of a PTC mode, Jack?
062:28:47|C|Lousma|Affirmative. We'll take whatever PTC mode you can set up, Jim.
062:28:54|T|CDR|Okay. And since you know our approximate attitude, how about just getting me something to fly you on the DSKY for a southerly plus X-direction.
062:29:04|C|Lousma|Roger. Stand by one.
062:30:35|T|CDR|And one other question, Houston. When you say power down the DSKY or the LGC, do you mean going into 06 or pulling the circuit breaker?
062:30:48|C|Lousma|Stand by on powering down the DSKY, Jim. We'll give you the procedure for that. The procedure that we -
062:30:57|T|CDR|Okay.
062:30:58|C|Lousma|- the procedure that we have is listed in several places. It's in the Contingency checklist under 'Power down' on page 1, second paragraph.
062:31:21|C|Lousma|And we'll give you that word when we want you to do that. That's LGC only, not to power down the IMU. But we'd like to have you hold off on that until we send you the word. Over.
062:31:38|T|CDR|Understand.
062:33:57|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, while we're working on this, we have a proposed Flight Plan update for your working and resting cycles. And - You ready to copy?
062:34:14|T|LMP|Okay. Do you want me to write this in the Flight Plan, per se, Jack?
062:34:19|C|Lousma|You can probably write it on a piece of scratch paper. This is pretty easy.
062:34:31|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead. We got a lot of scratch paper.
062:34:39|C|Lousma|Okay. We're suggesting that the LMP rest while the CMP and CDR are awake. LMP ought to hit the sack at about 63 hours, coming up in 25 minutes. And you get to rest for 6 hours. You get up at 69 hours. At 70 hours, the commander and the Command Module Pilot sleep for 6 hours until 76 hours. Around 70 - 76&frac12; to 77 hours, we'll do a P51 and a 52. At 78:30, we'll load P30 and align AGS to PGNS. Our ignition time for a second burn will be, presently, 79:25:26.5, and we'll have a PAD for you shortly. We suggest that all of you eat after the burn. That'll be 81 to 82 hours. Let the CMP and CDR eat while you are sleeping. And that you grab a bite as soon as you can. Over.
062:37:05|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. As I read that, the LMP is to go to sleep at 63:00 for about 6 hours. During that period, the CDR and CMP should try to get a bite to eat. I'm to awake at 69 hours. CDR and CMP sleep at 70 hours, and they are to awake at 76 hours. And we should plan on doing our P51, P52 at 76 hours to 76:30. At 78:30, we're going to load a P30 and align AGS to PGNS. Second maneuver is to take place at 79:25:26.5 for ignition time. Then we're all to eat at 81 to 82 hours.
062:38:05|C|Lousma|Okay. With a minor modification, your P51, P52 will be about 77 hours, and that's the period of darkness. And the commander and the CMP ought to eat around 68 to 69 hours, and you should eat between 69 to 70 hours just after you get up. We have left an hour in there where everybody is awake together to talk things over. Go ahead.
062:38:44|T|LMP|Okay. I'll eat after I wake up between 69 and 70.
062:38:53|C|Lousma|All right we have additional -
062:38:55|T|LMP|- and I've got the correction to P -
062:38:59|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Fred.
062:39:00|T|LMP|Yes. We got the word the P51, P52 is going to be done around 77 hours, while we're in darkness.
062:39:11|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. And we have a work-rest cycle laid out for further on, which we can relay to you later.
062:39:22|T|LMP|Okay.
062:39:40|T|CDR|Okay. And, Houston, you have advice on what attitude you want me to go to.
062:39:50|C|Lousma|Okay. That'll be the next bit of information. I'll get that for you, Jim.
062:39:56|T|CDR|Okay.
062:41:43|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, just to get you thinking in that direction, we've run a fairly thorough analysis, and we've found out that it's going to be cheaper to keep the LGC and the DSKY up and turn the inverter and the ball off. It's going to save us 1 amp and also some water, so it looks like what we're going to do. And we'll have to monitor the middle gimbal angle. And we'll get the procedure on that, and it'll also be an easier control mode where we'll be able to use the TTCA through the - through the DAP.
062:42:17|T|CDR|That sounds great, Jack.
062:47:28|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We've got a procedure for you. Ready to copy?
062:47:40|T|CDR|Ready to copy.
062:47:42|C|Lousma|Okay. It's pretty easy. We see you've already got Verb 16 Noun 20 called up there and so we want you to, in maneuver and PGNS Attitude Hold, use the TTCA. We want you to, on the commander's ball, pitch to 267.5 and yaw to minus 4.5. And when you do this in Verb 16 Noun 20, on the DSKY, you ought to read plus 00120, plus 26750, and plus 00450. Go ahead.
062:48:34|T|LMP|Okay. We're to drive the commander's ball to a pitch of 267.5, yaw minus 4.5. And we should have in 16 20 at that time, plus 00120, plus 26750, plus 00450.
062:48:56|C|Lousma|That's a good readback. We'll watch the maneuver.
062:56:25|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
062:56:27|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
062:56:31|T|CDR|Roger. You didn't mention roll on the ball. Do you want roll zero?
062:56:42|C|Lousma|The roll ought to be plus 1.2, Jim.
062:56:49|T|CDR|Roger.
063:03:41|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
063:03:44|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Jim.
063:03:48|T|CDR|Okay. We're just about there in pitch and near the middle gimbal angle, but that other gimbal angle didn't look like it pulled the right way. I tried both methods.
063:04:02|C|Lousma|Yes. I been looking at that, too, and we're asking why, and we'll get an answer for you.
063:04:20|T|LMP|Yes. Houston, I wonder if you're accounting for being a bit off the bellyband here, and going through GASTA.
063:04:38|C|Lousma|And, Freddo, I know you're supposed to start sleeping here pretty soon, but we got a new PC plus 2 PAD, P30 maneuver PAD for you.
063:04:56|T|CDR|Stand by.
063:05:32|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead, Jack.
063:05:35|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. P30 maneuver purpose is PC plus 2, DPS to this time, we're going to the MPL. And Noun 33; 079:27:40.13; plus 08144, minus 00443, minus 02226; apogee is N/A, perigee is plus 00205; 08455, 4:20; 268, 261; plus 08155, minus 00443, minus 02187; COAS is N/A. Your GDA ought to be okay as it is from the last burn, but pitch ought to be at 5.85; in roll, it's 6.74. Your ullage will be two jets for 10 seconds. Your DPS throttle will be 10 percent for 5 seconds, 40 percent for 21 seconds, and the remainder at full throtlle. And for your information, this will put you in the water at 142 plus 47. Over.
063:07:46|T|LMP|Okay. DPS, pericynthion plus 2 into the MPL; 079:27:40.13; plus 08144, minus 00443, minus 00226; N/A, plus 00205; 08455, 4 plus 20; 268, 261; plus 08155, minus 00443, minus 021 - 2187, N/A. GDA should be okay as is, which hopefully is pitch 5.85, yaw 6.74. Two-jet ullage for 10 seconds, the DPS throttle; 10 percent for 5 seconds, 40 percent for 21 seconds, 100 percent for the rest of the burn. And this should put us into the water at 142 plus 47.
063:09:03|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. I have a correction in Noun 81. Delta-V<sub>Z</sub> is minus 02226. Read back.
063:09:22|T|LMP|Okay. Delta-V<sub>Z</sub> in Noun 81 is minus 02226.
063:09:28|C|Lousma|Okay. Good readback.
063:09:41|T|LMP|Somehow that didn't add up with the Delta-V<sub>X</sub> to give a Delta-V<sub>R</sub> of that magnitude. It seems like it'd been bigger.
063:09:52|C|Lousma|Okay. We'll take another look at it, Fred.
063:12:29|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm not having too much luck holding this particular attitude.
063:12:42|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. Stand by one.
063:14:17|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. When you get her pretty much in attitude there, and it looks like you're as close as we need to be, we'd like to try a control mode and see if it will work; sort of a semi-PTC. We'll leave the ball powered up for this, and if this doesn't work, why, we'll have to revert to Attitude Hold mode. But - Stand by one, please.
063:15:03|C|Lousma|We'd like you to think about this control mode, Jim, and see if you think it might work from what you know right now. We're a little skeptical, but we'd like to put it to you. So, once you get in a pretty good attitude, monitor in Verb 16 Noun 20, go to PGNS Minimum Impulse, Verb 76, as we have, and set up a yaw rate - yaw rate to the right. Monitor the middle gimbal on R3 on the DSKY and see if she'll kind of stabilize out. If not, the only other suggestion we've got is to go to PGNS Attitude Hold. We'll keep the ball up until you make this evaluation.
063:15:45|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. You cut out, say again.
063:15:51|C|Lousma|Okay. Where'd you lose me, Jim?
063:15:56|T|CDR|I lost you when you said try the control mode; you're a little skeptical.
063:16:01|C|Lousma|Okay. From what you say, we have to be a little skeptical of this procedure, but we'd like to have you try it and have you evaluate it. You can monitor the middle gimbal on R3. Before we power down the ball, we want your evaluation. The next best choice is PGNS Attitude Hold. Over.
063:16:24|T|CDR|Okay. I'll try it.
063:16:53|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead with the control mode procedure.
063:17:30|T|CDR|Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
063:17:33|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
063:17:36|T|CDR|Okay. I'm not getting you. I can monitor register 3. I can probably keep it out of 270 - going into gimbal lock.
063:17:49|C|Lousma|Roger. How are pitch and roll?
063:18:39|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control.
063:18:40|T|CDR|Okay. I think I can control the gimbal angles in 16 20 with the compressors the way they are, but I'll have to try Minimum Impulse - Just a minute.
063:19:04|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. I've a question - one more question about Odyssey.
063:19:08|C|Lousma|Go ahead.
063:19:14|T|CMP|Okay, I still have the Pyro A sequence A and Pyro B sequence B circuit breakers in. Do you want those out?
063:19:23|C|Lousma|Stand by one.
063:19:37|C|Lousma|Odyssey, Houston. The two circuit breakers you referred to, leave them in.
063:19:45|T|CMP|Okay. Copy. Leave them in.
063:19:59|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I can control yaw in minimum impulse, but stand by on pitch.
063:20:17|C|Lousma|And, Freddo, the Delta-V<sub>R</sub> resultant computes with the components.
063:20:29|T|CDR|Fred's off the Comm now, Jack.
063:20:32|C|Lousma|Roger. Your PAD is good.
063:20:35|T|CMP|And, Jack, we didn't get that whole sentence there.
063:20:39|C|Lousma|Okay. I said that the Delta-V<sub>R</sub> that Fred questioned computes well with the component - its RMS.
063:20:49|T|CMP|Okay. Copy.
063:20:54|T|CDR|Okay, now. Jack, let's go over this once more. You wanted me to try out control of the spacecraft in the Pulse mode. Is that correct?
063:21:03|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. Set up a yaw right rate and monitor the middle gimbal angle.
063:21:16|T|CDR|Okay. I can do that. I'm not too sure whether I can control roll or pitch in pulse, but I can control yaw in pulse - yaw in pulse on the ball.
063:21:30|C|Lousma|Roger. And remember we're not going to have a ball there, so that we're going to be monitoring CDUs on the DSKY, and if we get it off, it will be pretty hard to figure out where to fly back to; and, well, in addition, have to control the Omnis while we're doing this.
063:21:52|T|CDR|Roger.
063:22:06|T|CDR|Without the ball, I still have use of the TTCA for control of the - angles.
063:22:12|C|Lousma|Affirmative. You'll have the TTCA for pitch and roll.
063:22:18|T|CDR|Okay. I think I can do that without the ball, and if you just give me the TTCAs I think I can control the spacecraft using 16 20.
063:22:31|T|CDR|I'll start a yaw right.
063:22:49|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. I am now - The Register 1 is in the Decrease mode.
063:23:36|T|CDR|And, Houston, do you see anything wrong with this spacecraft motion?
063:23:46|C|Lousma|We have a data drop on right now, Jim; we'll look at it as soon as it comes up.
063:24:52|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. We're going to dispense with this control mode. We'd like you to fly the machine back to the original attitude that you had, and we'll go PGNS Attitude Hold, and then we've got to get that ball off the line to save some power. And then, in order to keep even heating, every 15 or 30 minutes, we'll give you a call to give us 90 or 180 degrees of roll - of yaw.
063:25:27|T|CDR|Okay. You want me to go back to original attitude. I'll be going back to it now.
063:26:21|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control; 63 hours, 26 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Recapping the upcoming pericynthion plus 2 hours maneuver with the Descent Propulsion System engine. Time of ignition: 79 hours, 27 minutes, 40 seconds. The velocity change will be posigrade 845.5 feet per second or a burn time of 4 minutes, 20 seconds. The throttle schedule on the Descent Propulsion engine will be 5 seconds at 10 percent, 21 seconds at 40 percent and the remainder of the 4 minutes and 20 seconds at full throttle. This burn will produce a splash in the southwest Pacific at 142 hours, 47 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The tentative coordinates for entry interface, or 400,000 feet, is 28 degrees south latitude by 173 degrees, 14 minutes east longitude. Splashdown will be somewhat to the east of that, actually, across the international date line to about 173 degrees west longitude. The spacecraft presently 191,898 nautical miles [355,395 km] out from Earth; velocity, 3,034 feet per second [925 m/s]. And at 63 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
063:28:36|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I'm flying it back over towards the initial angles you gave me of a pitch of 257. I'll get near the bellyband in roll and yaw; then I'll go to PGNS Att Hold.
063:28:47|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jim. And then we're going to have you go through a powerdown procedure.
063:28:56|T|CDR|Okay.
063:29:02|C|Lousma|And you'll need Verb 77 with Att Hold when you get there.
063:29:08|T|CDR|Will do.
063:31:48|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. As I get near 360 on yaw and roll? I'm going to go to Att Hold.
063:31:56|C|Lousma|Roger. And then we want to get the ball powered down.
063:32:02|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by.
063:32:52|T|CDR|Okay. I'm now in PGNS Att Hold. And are you reading my DSKY angles?
063:32:58|C|Lousma|Roger. We see them.
063:33:03|T|CDR|Now, you want me to power down the ball, and if you'll give me the procedure for that, I'll do it right away.
063:33:06|C|Lousma|Okay. We'll buy what you've got on the DSKY there, and we'd just like to go through an overall powerdown procedure, and in so doing we'll catch the ball and inverter and it will only take a few minutes. So are you ready to start on panel 11?
063:33:23|T|CDR|Roger. Jack will copy, and I'll do the work.
063:33:27|C|Lousma|Okay. Panel 11, top row, open all the circuit breakers.
063:33:35|T|CDR|All circuit breakers on top row coming open.
063:33:48|T|CDR|They're all open, top row.
063:33:50|C|Lousma|Okay. Second row, close the first six on the left through the ISOL Valve and open all to the right of that.
063:34:07|T|CDR|Okay. First six on the left are closed - That's through the ISOL Valve, but I opened up every one from there on.
063:34:13|C|Lousma|Okay. Third row, open up the next five - correction - Open up the first five on the left, close AOT Heater, close Sig[nal] Conditioner 1. Close Attitude Direct, and open the rest on row three.
063:34:46|T|CDR|Do you want ATCA (PGNS) open?
063:34:53|C|Lousma|Leave ATCA (PGNS) closed; four breakers on the third row must be closed. AOT Heater, Sig Conditioner 1, and ATCA (PGNS), Attitude Direct Control. Our mistake, good going.
063:35:13|T|CDR|Okay. I'm opening up Engine Start Override right now. And that row's taken care of.
063:35:30|C|Lousma|Okay. On the fourth row. Open - From the left, open the first five - correction - Close the first five, and open Cabin Fan 1. Close the three Glycol Pump circuit breakers; open all the Comm breakers, except for Commander's Audio; close it. All the PGNS breakers, open - correction - Open the first three PGNS breakers, close LGC/DSKY, IMU Standby, IMU Operate.
063:36:23|T|CDR|That's complete, Jack.
063:36:27|C|Lousma|Okay. And EPS, close BAT Feed Ties, Cross Tie Bal Load, and open the Cross Tie Bus. Close the next three; open Ascent ECA Control, Ascent ECA, and Inverter 1. Close DC Bus Volt. Go ahead.
063:37:02|T|CDR|That's complete, Jack. Panel 11 is configured.
063:37:09|C|Lousma|Okay. Let's go over to panel 16, top row, and starting from the left - Open the first four.
063:37:27|T|CDR|Stand by, Jack.
063:37:38|T|CDR|Okay. Starting from the left, open the first four.
063:37:43|C|Lousma|Okay. And close the ISOL Valve, keep your TCA breakers closed, close the Crossfeed, open the next two displays. Close the Main SOV and the Propulsion breakers should all three be open.
063:38:08|T|CDR|Roger. The main SOVs are closed, and the Display Engine Override Logic's coming open, and the PQGS and ASC He REG are open.
063:38:18|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. The second row: they should all be open except for three breakers under instrumentation. Close Sig Sensor, PCM/TE, and Sig Conditioner 2. Over.
063:38:41|T|CDR|Roger. Do you want Suit Flow Control open?
063:38:57|T|CDR|Engine ARM coming open and ASA I guess will be open. Is that correct?
063:39:01|C|Lousma|We just got a change on that. Let's keep the ASA closed.
063:39:09|T|CDR|How about Suit Flow Control and Engine ARM?
063:39:22|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. Suit Flow Control can be open, and Engine ARM - Engine ARM open.
063:39:40|T|CDR|Okay. Let's go to row 3.
063:39:44|C|Lousma|Okay. Row 3 under Comm. Open Displays, close SE Audio, open VHF A Transmitter and B Receiver, close the Primary S-Band circuit breakers, both of them. Open the S-Band Antenna, PMP closed, TV open, and all the rest of them open under ECS, except CO<sub>2</sub> Sensor, closed.
063:40:24|T|CDR|Roger.
063:40:31|C|Lousma|Okay. Under row 4: under Heaters, your RCS Quad heaters should - four of them - be closed, open Displays, open S-Band Antenna, open Sequence Camera. Under EPS, open Displays, close DC Bus Volt, open Inverter 2, open Ascent ECA Control and Ascent ECA, close Descent ECA, Descent ECA Control, Translunar Bus Tie, close Cross Tie Bal Loads, open Cross Tie Bus, close Bat Feed Ties. Over.
063:41:29|T|CDR|That's been completed, Jack.
063:41:55|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. And we've already got a change to what we just told you. Under ECS, close the Cabin Repress, and ensure that the ASA Breaker is closed under S and C.
063:42:16|T|CDR|The ASA Breaker is closed, but I closed the Cabin Repress.
063:42:25|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. Looks like what we have to do is - In order to maintain even heating, we just have to yaw the whole machine about 90 degrees per hour in increments. So we'll give you a call when it's time to yaw 90 degrees.
063:43:04|T|CDR|Okay. We have to yaw the machine as I understand it, Houston, and you'll give it to me in increments of 90 degrees.
063:43:11|C|Lousma|That's affirm.
063:44:16|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. Your present configuration has the following features. We got the electrical Buses cross tied through the Bal Load circuit breakers, and we have Auto Cabin Repress. One thing we'd like to do right now is to give you an uplink, so immediately we have to, on panel 11, close the Updata Link circuit breaker. Go to P00 and Data. Over.
063:44:52|T|CDR|Okay. We're going to P00 and Data. The circuit breaker is closed.
063:48:57|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. Did you say that you had a new PAD for us to copy?
063:49:02|C|Lousma|Jim, I passed that newest PAD that we have to Fred about 30 minutes ago. That's our latest. It's PC plus 2, and it begins with Noun 33 of 79 hours 27 minutes and 40.13 seconds. You got that one?
063:49:25|T|CDR|Okay. We've got that one. What kind of a Att Hold Mode do you want us to do? Do you want us to do Wide Deadband? I didn't see what we had on the DAP.
063:49:40|C|Lousma|Jim, the deadband is good the way it is. It's 5 degrees, if you want to stay in it. And stay in the PGNS Att Hold mode.
063:49:49|T|CDR|Okay.
063:50:33|C|Lousma|Two things, Jim. We want you to know that there's some pretty big attitude errors in, so if you go to Auto, the computer is going to try to crank you around, and the other thing is don't drink water out of the LM.
063:50:54|T|CDR|Okay. You might think about this. You know we lost our oxygen pressure in the Command Module.
063:51:56|C|Lousma|Aquarius, we're finished with the uplink. The computer is yours, and you can open the Updata Link circuit breaker.
063:52:18|T|CDR|Okay. We've opened up the Updata Link, and we've gone Off of Data, and I've got 16 20 in the computer.
063:52:28|C|Lousma|Roger, Jim. I guess we're going to just kind of perk away here now.
063:52:37|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. One more question about Odyssey here.
063:52:45|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Jack.
063:52:50|T|CMP|Okay. How about the Service Module O<sub>2</sub> supply valve? Do you want that off?
063:53:01|C|Lousma|Affirmative. Service Module O<sub>2</sub> supply off, Jack.
063:53:06|T|CMP|Okay. On my way.
063:53:17|C|Lousma|And, Jim, we see a Program Alarm in there. We think it's just got to do with pulling the Updata Link circuit breaker - Updata too fast.
063:53:30|T|CDR|Roger. I don't see it. Should I reset?
063:53:40|C|Lousma|Go ahead and reset, Jim.
063:56:11|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
063:56:16|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
063:56:21|T|CDR|One thought that might occur here is that if we have low descent water pressure, we might consider taking the PLSS water and fill it in reverse. If that works, you might look at a procedure for that.
063:56:34|C|Lousma|That's a good thought. Let us bounce that around a little.
063:57:12|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. That's a good thought, and we've looked at that, and it looks like that's feasible. So if and when we need to do that, we will.
063:58:11|T|CDR|And, something else, Jack. When it's time for me to make my 90-degree yaw, what I planned on doing was going to Noun 76 hold and just pulse and yaw several times until the yaw start and hope that pitch and roll stay within limit.
063:58:37|C|Lousma|Roger. It sounds like a good plan and you can use your TTCA in MIN IMPULSE to take care of pitch and roll.
063:58:47|T|CDR|Okay.
064:00:21|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We see Ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2 building up again, so we'd like to use something out of it, so turn on ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2 and turn off descent O<sub>2</sub>.
064:00:39|T|CDR|Roger. Opening up ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2, and turning off descent.
064:03:01|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, Houston. We're starting to think about CO<sub>2</sub> buildup up in the Command Module there so we've got a recommendation, and what we're recommending is that you take the commander's hoses in the LM and put a cap over the red return hose and then figure out a way to fasten those hoses so they blow up into the CSM by extending them up through the tunnel as far as possible. And we'll get some flow out the blue side, circulate up and around the Command Module and to keep the CO<sub>2</sub> level down.
064:03:43|T|CDR|Roger. We're thinking of that too, and one problem is that the comm is connected securely to the hose, so we've got to get the comm cable off somehow to get that - So we'll still have comm down here in the LM and you have the hose up there.
064:05:10|T|CDR|Houston, we're trying to extend that commander's hose by use of the vacuum hose.
064:05:22|C|Lousma|Sounds like a good plan if you can work that out, Jim.
064:06:58|C|Lousma|Aquarius, if you can shake Jack loose there, I've got a - some procedures for him to write down.
064:07:09|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by.
064:07:33|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Is this a long one?
064:07:37|C|Lousma|Oh, it's about 12 - 15 lines. It's a matter of verifying some valves and so forth.
064:07:50|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
064:07:53|C|Lousma|Okay. We want you to go in when you can and verify the following valves and leave them as we outline here. Repress Package valve, Off; Emergency Cabin Pressure, Off; Direct O<sub>2</sub>, Off; Demand Reg, Off; both Water Accumulators, Off; Main REG A and B, Open; Water Glycol - correction - Water and then Glycol Tank Inlet and Outlet, both. Now if you want to get some water, we recommend that you momentarily turn the Surge Tank on to pressurize the system and then turn it off and take out water as required. Over.
064:09:33|C|Lousma|That's it, Jack. And another note on taking water; if you don't drain enough water so that -
064:09:49|C|Lousma|Say again, Aquarius.
064:09:53|T|CMP|That wasn't us, Jack.
064:09:58|C|Lousma|Okay. One more note on the water, Jack. If you don't bleed the pressure off when you - don't take enough water to bleed the pressure off completely, the pressure that's left on there is going to drain away in a period of 1 to 3 hours. So it's a small amount of oxygen, but we might as well save it. So if you want to eliminate that problem you could completely drain the pressure off by putting the water in a water bag and saving it that way.
064:10:36|T|CMP|Okay. That's a good idea.
064:10:38|C|Lousma|So that's the end of my -
064:10:39|T|CMP|What I'll do - let me repeat - Okay. Let me repeat it all back to you. Repress Package valve, Off; Emergency Cabin Pressure, Off; Direct O<sub>2</sub>, Off; both the Demand Regs, Off; both H<sub>2</sub>O Glycol Accumulators, Water Glycol Accumulators, Off; Main Reg A and B, Open; Water and Glycol Tank Inlet and Outlet, Open; for water, momentarily pressurize the Surge Tank, take out water as required. You're recommending drain out all the water until I can't get any more water out of it in order to conserve the oxygen.
064:11:34|C|Lousma|Okay. We just want you to turn off the water accumulators and not the glycol accumulator. Over.
064:11:49|T|CMP|Okay. These are the water accumulators on 382, right?
064:28:01|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 64 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Briefly the situation with Apollo 13. The crew in the last hour was passed up a pericynthion plus 2 hours maneuver which actually is primarily a speed up maneuver to get them back to Earth somewhat earlier than the normal free return would bring them. This maneuver would come at 79 hours, 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Would involve 845 feet per second velocity change. Splashdown would be in the southwest Pacific, north of New Zealand at about 142 hours, 47 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. At the present time, the LM oxygen quantity is 50.6 pounds and 300 pounds of water on board. Cabin pressure holding steadily and 4.7 up to 5 pounds in both spacecraft. The tunnel between the two is open so they share a common atmosphere. Apollo 13 now 193,700 nautical miles [358,700 km] out from Earth; velocity, 3,005 feet per second [916 m/s]. Discussions here in the control room have to do with the power down procedures. How to conserve electrical power, the water used in the coolant, for cooling the various electronic systems in the spacecraft. How to husband all these consumables to get the most mileage from them. And it's 64 hours, 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and standing by; this is Apollo Control.
064:37:40|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
064:37:43|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go.
064:37:48|T|CDR|Roger, Jack. We're asking whether P51 and a P52 are required in the back side of the Moon.
064:37:56|C|Kerwin|I think so, Jim, but stand by while I verify it.
064:38:23|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
064:38:28|T|CDR|Go ahead.
064:38:30|C|Kerwin|We think we know where the platform is, Jim. The tracking looks real good from the last burn. We feel just a P52 will be required.
064:38:39|T|CDR|Okay.
064:38:54|T|CMP|Joe, has your continued tracking changed our pericynthion altitude any?
064:39:01|C|Kerwin|Stand by. We'll get the latest on that, Jack.
064:39:50|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
064:39:54|T|CMP|Go ahead.
064:39:56|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jack. We're still looking at 137 [nautical] miles and Doppler's confirming it. We will have a good update after 67 hours.
064:40:08|T|CMP|That's good. I want to say you guys are doing real good work.
064:40:13|C|Kerwin|So are you guys, Jack.
064:47:06|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
064:47:13|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
064:47:14|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We've come up with a comm recommendation which we hope will save some power by powering down the power amplifier, if it works. And I'd like to read up the steps to you and have you think about them for a minute, and we recommend trying it before the first yaw maneuver. Over.
064:47:43|T|CDR|Okay. You can read up the steps.
064:47:48|C|Kerwin|Okay. Step 1; Biomed, Off; step 2, go to Low Bit Rate; step 3, go to Downvoice Backup; step 4, Power Amp to Prime; step 5, panel 16, Power Amp Circuit Breaker, Open; step 6, Range Function switch, Off. Read those back to me, and then I'll have a remark.
064:48:39|T|CDR|Okay. Biomed, Off; Low Bit Rate; Downvoice Backup; Power Amp to Prime; circuit breakers, panel 16, Power Amp Circuit Breaker, Open. Range Function switch, Off.
064:48:56|C|Kerwin|Okay. And the note says that you should be able to hear us. If we can't hear you in a couple of minutes, you should close the Power Amp circuit breaker on panel 16, and we expect to save an amp or more on this. It should work in the present attitude. When we go to the new yaw attitude, we're thinking about powering up the steerable, leaving the Power Amp off and, if we can get good comm in that mode, we'll still save some power. So if you concur, why don't you go ahead.
064:49:44|T|CDR|Okay. In this mode, you should hear us - or we should hear you, but if you can't hear us, then we ought to close Power Amp circuit breaker again. Is that right.
064:49:54|C|Kerwin|That's affirm. We'll just run a little comm check after you get done and see how we're doing.
064:50:03|T|CDR|Okay, fine. And if that all fails, we'll go back to our original configuration.
064:50:06|C|Kerwin|That's affirm.
064:51:01|T|CDR|Power amps Primary.
064:51:04|T|CMP|Power amps is in Primary.
064:51:06|T|CDR|Okay. Circuit breakers 16, Power Amp circuit breaker, Open; comm; Power Amp circuit breaker, Open.
064:51:18|T|CMP|There's only one. Ready?
064:51:23|T|CDR|Range Function switch, Off.
064:51:28|T|CDR|It is off ...
064:51:35|T|CMP|Yes, I think so. Yes, that's off.
064:51:49|T|CDR|... Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read me?
064:51:53|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, this is Houston. We read you with a lot of noise in the background. How do you read us? Over.
064:52:03|T|CDR|We read you with a lot of noise, the noise seems to indicate ... 
064:52:15|C|Kerwin|I didn't copy your last remark, Jim. I heard that you had a lot of noise in the background also.
064:52:23|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read us now?
064:52:27|C|Kerwin|Just the same, Jim. You're readable but it's very noisy.
064:52:45|T|CDR|Okay. We can still read you. Do you want us to remain in this configuration?
064:52:51|C|Kerwin|Stay there for the next minute or two anyway, Jim, while we evaluate it.
064:53:23|T|CDR|Okay. I'll tell you what we need, Jack. Try to get this squared away I guess. We need to get some book to write procedures in, times the procedures, the whole works, before we get all balled up here.
064:53:41|T|CMP|Yes. Okay. et me get - let me get something here.
064:53:53|T|CDR|I've come up with nothing here.
064:54:47|T|CDR|... we can use.
064:54:54|T|CDR|Stand by for DPS burn. Give me - ... over on my side there. My - ...
064:55:21|T|CMP|Find anything back in there?
064:55:23|T|CDR|No, nothing.
064:55:40|T|CMP|Better get a ... there, a paper towel ...
064:55:47|T|CDR|Let's just check in here ...
064:55:53|T|CMP|Yes.
064:55:54|T|CDR|... Well, we should have some around here somewhere.
064:55:57|T|CMP|Yes. They're in a bag ...
064:56:07|T|CDR|Oh, here they are. ...
064:56:52|T|CDR|Why don't you put that right up there, just like that. ... There you go.
064:58:01|T|CMP|...
064:58:09|T|CDR|It sure stays on, I'll tell you that. It's built like a regular ...
064:58:20|T|CDR|Hey, look out that left-hand window, ... I can't see a thing.
064:58:35|T|CMP|...
064:58:49|T|CDR|Well, is there anything could have done earlier?
064:59:22|T|CDR|Okay. What we do here is, ...?
064:59:29|T|CMP|You want to use ...
064:59:33|T|CDR|... the Command Module.
064:59:56|T|CDR|Find the Flight Plan, too, while up there.
065:02:48|T|CDR|Okay. Why don't you recopy this procedure on page 4-42.
065:02:59|T|CDR|We've got to keep a log of all the procedures?
065:03:15|T|CDR|We ought to copy down when we get water, too. ... Keep them all in one spot.
065:03:23|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
065:03:29|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
065:03:31|C|Kerwin|Okay. Speak slow because there's a lot of noise in the background. Have you completed your first 90-degree yaw maneuver? And, if you haven't, we recommend it. Over.
065:03:45|T|CDR|Okay. We have not. We have not completed it. We will start. We want you to monitor the maneuver. Over.
065:03:53|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. And I want to pass you up a short procedure for activating the S-band steerable antenna, which we'd like you to do after you complete the 90-degree yaw. Are you ready to copy? Over.
065:04:14|T|CDR|Ready to copy.
065:04:16|C|Kerwin|Okay. First, on panel 11, close the S-Band Antenna circuit breaker. Then go to Activation, page 28, steerable antenna activation -
065:04:30|T|CDR|Ready to copy.
065:04:34|C|Kerwin|- and complete steps 2, 3, and 4 of Activation 28. You'll have to do a Verb 64 to get the pitch and yaw angles, and the last step is on panel 16, S-Band Antenna Heater circuit breaker to Close. Over.
065:05:03|T|CDR|Joe, we didn't get all of that. We just have, &quot;Complete steps 2, 3, and 4 of activation&quot; and then 68 or 28.
065:05:11|T|CMP|28.
065:05:13|C|Kerwin|Jim, that's -
065:05:15|T|CDR|Then do a Verb 64 to get -
065:05:39|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. That procedure I just passed you, please disregard it. Over.
065:05:50|T|CDR|Disregard it. Okay. Do you want me to start my yaw maneuver now? And I'll be yawing to my right. Clockwise maneuver.
065:05:59|C|Kerwin|Roger. Right yaw is acceptable, but wait one before you start the maneuver.
065:06:09|T|CDR|Roger.
065:06:33|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
065:06:38|T|CDR|Go ahead.
065:06:39|C|Kerwin|Okay. You are Go to commence the yaw maneuver. If we don't have comm after you complete the yaw maneuver, bring the power amplifier back on. Over.
065:06:54|T|CDR|Roger. Understand. We'll start the yaw.
065:06:57|C|Kerwin|Okay.
065:07:19|T|CMP|... degrees ...
065:07:28|T|CDR|Have to go to 277.
065:11:20|T|CDR|They're almost getting bigger and bigger, Jack. It's over here now.
065:11:52|T|CDR|Hey, you got a list ... off over here.
065:11:55|T|CMP|All that stuff we've checked.
065:11:57|T|CDR|All we want to do is put water in it.
065:13:43|T|CDR|What do I turn that to?
065:13:51|T|CMP|... going to 270.
065:14:17|T|CDR|275, yes. Got it down to 270 ... pitch 
065:15:32|T|CDR|It's jumping now.
065:17:15|T|CDR|Why ...
065:19:28|T|CMP|...
065:19:33|C|Kerwin|Houston, Aquarius. Did you call?
065:19:38|T|CDR|Negative, Houston. We did not call. How you reading us?
065:19:42|T|CMP|Get ... front and turn that antenna ...
065:19:49|T|CDR|And, Houston, could you give us an approximate time to turn off the ascent O<sub>2</sub> in case we're loose voice with you?
065:19:59|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jim; and copying about half your words.
065:20:08|T|CDR|Roger, Houston. We'd like a time to go back to descent O<sub>2</sub> in case we lose communications with you.
065:20:20|C|Kerwin|Jim, Houston. That's affirmative. You may go back to descent O<sub>2</sub>. Over.
065:20:30|T|CDR|Roger. Going back now.
065:20:33|C|Kerwin|Copy that.
065:21:37|T|CDR|We're approaching up-side down.
065:21:39|T|CMP|Yes.
065:22:13|T|CMP|Think we'll have any problems getting that ... with that ... in there?
065:22:19|T|CDR|Probably not, if everything holds together because we already made one burn.
065:22:24|T|CDR|And the temperatures, okay. 
065:22:28|T|CMP|When you make a burn, does that do something ...?
065:22:32|T|CDR|... right now.
065:22:46|T|CDR|Well, Jack. This is going to be difficult.
065:22:55|T|CMP|... ...
065:23:09|T|CDR|I'll tell you, we'll have to start thinking about you and I eating.
065:23:15|T|CMP|We've got an orange juice here.
065:23:19|T|CDR|How about ...?
065:23:53|T|CDR|You and I eat separately. ... I can't open ...
065:24:09|T|CDR|Yes, we got ...
065:26:11|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Rather noisy communications at the present time on the air-to-ground circuit to Apollo 13. Meanwhile the spaceflight meteorology group of the Environmental Service - Environmental Sciences Services Administration has issued - forecast that weather conditions will be satisfactory for Apollo 13's landing in the Pacific Ocean next Friday, April 17. Along the planned recovery line in the Central South Pacific, skies will be partly cloudy with southerly winds at 15 knots. Seas up to 4 feet are expected. The temperature is near 80 degrees. Apollo 13 is now 195,375 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity is 2,981 feet per second. At 65 hours 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control standing by.
065:26:47|T|CDR|They said manuever once every hour?
065:30:14|T|CDR|... that surge tank ...?
065:30:23|T|CDR|How much of that oxygen are you going to use for -
065:30:30|T|CMP|We got - water glycol ... off. ... need any more water? ... again?
065:31:36|T|CDR|... out there?
065:31:38|T|CMP|Yes, why don't we ...?
065:31:53|T|CMP|... out? Can you get that?
065:32:44|T|CDR|Hold it down there ... that's okay ...
065:33:56|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. ... new attitude ... ?
065:34:02|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Say again, please. ...
065:34:09|T|CDR|Roger. We have a radio check at a new attitude.
065:34:14|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We copy the angles. How are you receiving the voice now? Over.
065:34:23|T|CDR|Your voice is excellent.
065:34:28|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real good. You are clear. We still have a lot of noise, but if you talk slow I think we can manage.
065:35:20|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
065:35:28|T|CDR|This is Aquarius. Go ahead.
065:35:31|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jim. We're trying to improve our comm down here. We'd like to try going function switch from Down Voice Backup to Voice. Over.
065:35:48|T|CMP|That is Down Voice Backup going VOICE. 
065:35:51|T|CDR|FUNCTION switch ... FUNCTION switch going from Down Voice Backup to Voice.
065:36:00|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
065:36:57|C|Kerwin|How do you read now, Jim?
065:37:37|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Request a short count. Over.
065:38:16|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. We're not reading you at all. Request you go back to Down Voice Backup. Over.
065:38:34|T|CDR|All right. Houston, Aquarius in Down Voice Backup. How do you read? Over.
065:38:41|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim, we read you now and you'd better stay in this configuration.
065:39:03|T|CDR|Well, ... try ...
065:39:13|T|CMP|...
065:39:43|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
065:39:50|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
065:39:52|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim, since we're in Low Bit Rate now, we cannot monitor the DSKY for program alarms, et cetera, and we recommend that, in order for you to do so on board, you push in the following circuit breakers: On panel 11 and panel 16, the Anunciator/Dock/Component circuit breakers. That will allow you to monitor your DSKY warning lights. Over.
065:40:34|T|CDR|Okay, fine ...
065:40:37|T|CMP|..., Off.
065:40:42|T|CDR|Roger, Houston. Would you say one more time the circuit breakers?
065:40:47|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. The circuit breakers are the Anunciator/Dock/Component circuit breakers on panel 11, third row, far right, under Lighting; and on panel 16, also under Lighting, second row, third from the left. Over.
065:41:23|T|CDR|Roger, Houston. We have those two circuit breakers - engaged.
065:41:30|C|Kerwin|Okay, real good.
065:45:45|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control; 65 hours, 45 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Communications are rathery scratchy at this time. Back over the past 8 or 10 hours of the mission: The problem first cropped up at about 55 hours and 58 minutes Ground Elapsed Time last evening when the crew first reported an under voltage alarm on the Command Module main bus B. This was their first hint that something was amiss. The pressure rapidly dropped in the Service Module liquid oxygen tank number 2 and fuel cells 1 and 3 failed shortly thereafter. A decision was made to scrub any attempt at landing and continue on a lunar fly-by deep space abort type mission. The increased load on fuel cell 2 and the dropping pressure in the remaining liquid oxygen tank led to the decision to use the Lunar Module for a sort of lifeboat to come back to Earth using its consumables for life support. The remainder of the evening was spent in trying to get the power and water profile pared down to get the most mileage out of these items. And at 61 hours, 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, a 38 feet per second [11.6 m/s] mid-course correction burn using the Descent Propulsion System of the Lunar Module put the spacecraft back onto a free return trajectory which, if nothing more were done, would cause the Command Module to enter in the - to reenter the Earth's atmosphere in the Indian Ocean south of Mauritius at about 152 hours Ground Elapsed Time. However, another DPS or Descent Propulsion System burn is being planned at approximately 79 hours, 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time with a velocity change posigrade of 845.5 feet per second [257.7 m/s], which would bring the spacecraft home somewhat more rapidly, about 10 hours sooner, as a matter of fact, to splash down in the southwest Pacific at 142 hours, north of New Zealand and that's where the situation stands at the moment. We'll be handing over to the Gold team shortly here in Mission Control. And at 65 hours, 49 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control, standing by.
065:51:02|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
065:51:16|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, this is Houston. Go ahead.
065:51:21|T|CDR|Joe, it appears that the best detent possibly to put the stars in the AOT, would be either number 2 or 4 detent. The Rendezvous Radar antenna is now in the way. You might think of a procedure to get rid of it with minimum power and we maybe we'll be able to see stars ... couple ... lower detent.
065:51:48|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. I think I understood that the Rendezvous Radar antenna is in the way and you would like a procedure to get it out of the way. Is that right?
065:52:00|T|CDR|That's affirm; at the proper time, and with minimum power.
065:52:06|C|Kerwin|Roger. Understand. We'll work that.
065:58:28|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
065:58:34|T|CDR|Go ahead.
065:58:36|C|Kerwin|Okay. Jim, we have a handover coming up on the hour; that's in a minute and a half. On the hour, we would like you to turn the S-Band Transmitter/Receiver switch to Off, and 5 minutes later turn it back to Primary. Over.
065:59:17|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Shortly you want us to turn the S-Band Transmitter/Receiver to Off; 5 minutes later, turn it back to Primary.
065:59:29|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative, Jim. After the handover apparently they want to make sure that they lockup with you and not the IU.
065:59:43|T|CDR|Roger. And let me know when you want me to turn it off.
065:59:51|C|Kerwin|Roger. You can turn it off now.
066:00:18|T|CDR|And, Houston, when do you want me to turn that S-Band Transmitter/Receiver off?
066:00:24|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Turn it off now.
066:00:31|T|CDR|Turning it off now.
066:08:25|C|Kerwin|Okay, Aquarius; Houston. We have data back and I assume we have comm. Over.
066:08:35|T|CDR|Houston, This is Aquarius. The comm is very, very, very noisy. Over.
066:08:41|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Copy that. It's noisy on our end, too; stand by while we think about it.
066:09:08|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. I am unable to ... How do you read now ...
066:09:17|C|Kerwin|Jim, Houston. I think you just called, but I didn't copy you.
066:10:32|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
066:10:38|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
066:10:41|C|Kerwin|Jim, recommend you push the Power Amplifier circuit breaker on panel 16 in. Over.
066:10:51|T|CDR|Roger. Power Amplifier circuit breaker panel 16 going in.
066:11:16|T|CDR|Power Amplifier circuit breaker is in.
066:11:19|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. How is the comm now? Over.
066:11:27|T|CDR|A lot of background noise. Let me turn off the Squelch.
066:11:32|C|Kerwin|Okay. You're quite a bit better.
066:11:41|T|CDR|Whenever I enable Squelch, I lose you. Over.
066:11:45|C|Kerwin|Roger. Stand by. You are much better downlink.
066:12:01|T|CMP|Look at Noun 65.
066:12:04|T|CDR|Okay.
066:12:28|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. This is Houston. We recommend that you set the Function switch from Downvoice Backup to Voice. Over.
066:12:40|T|CDR|Roger. Function switch going from Downvoice Backup to Voice.
066:13:10|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. How's the comm now?
066:13:12|T|CDR|Function switch is in VOICE. There's still a lot of background noise, Joe.
066:13:21|C|Kerwin|Okay. We'll look at it some more. Your comm down to us is excellent now.
066:17:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Hand over from the Black team headed up by Glynn Lunney to the Gold team headed up by Flight Director Gerry Griffin is under way at the moment. We're anticipating within the next several minutes, change of shift press briefing in the News Center Auditorium or News Center Briefing Room, which will be localized to the briefing room only. The Air-Ground will be left up on the PAO release circuit. We understand it will be in the big Auditorium. And further advice of the time and participants of this press conference will be forthcoming. This is Apollo Control standing by.
066:18:27|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
066:18:31|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
066:18:36|T|CDR|The noise we're experiencing is similar to what we had sometime before when you switched stations.
066:18:56|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jim. INCO is checking into what we can do about the noise. It may be a problem with the new site.
066:19:12|T|CDR|Roger.
066:23:07|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Is the noise any better now? Over.
066:23:17|T|CDR|This is Aquarius. Negative.
066:23:20|C|Kerwin|Roger.
066:33:34|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
066:33:36|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
066:33:42|T|CDR|Roger. Will you let us know when you want us to yaw another 90 degrees right?
066:33:49|C|Kerwin|Will do, Jim. Stand by one.
066:33:54|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We're ready now to yaw another 90 degrees to the right.
066:34:02|T|CDR|Roger.
066:36:14|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
066:36:20|T|CDR|Go ahead.
066:36:21|C|Kerwin|We are going to try to improve the comm and telemetry by temporarily breaking lock and reacquiring. You may hear some noise in your headset.
066:36:33|T|CDR|Okay. Couldn't be any more noise than we're getting now.
066:36:36|C|Kerwin|Right.
066:37:27|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 66 hours, 37 minutes. Flight Director Glynn Lunney is still in the Control's PAO center. We will notify newsmen on this line when he leaves for the MSC Auditorium. Apollo 13 now is 197,424 nautical miles [365,629 km] from Earth. It's velocity is 2,953 feet per second [900 m/s].
066:38:56|T|CDR|Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
066:38:59|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
066:39:03|T|CDR|Okay. Now that there's no noise, I'll give it another turn.
066:39:15|C|Kerwin|Jim, I didn't copy that. Your comm is pretty good, though. How is it with us?
066:40:07|T|CDR|Houston, do you want to reconfigure the Down Voice Backup again?
066:40:12|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. I don't think so at this time. Our voice is good now. How's yours?
066:40:22|T|CDR|Ours is very good.
066:40:26|C|Kerwin|Okay, why don't we stay where we are for a few minutes.
067:02:42|T|CDR|Okay. Houston, Aquarius. We're deadbanding in the new attitude.
067:02:48|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Roger that, and your comm is good.
067:23:37|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 67 hours, 23 minutes. Flight Director Glynn Lunney is still in the Mission Control Center. There has been considerable discussions and meetings on the floor here since his shift changed. He and Flight Director Gerry Griffin, Director of Flight Operations - Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton, the Apollo Mission Director Chet Lee, the Apollo Program Director Rocco Petrone and other management officials have been holding some discussions. We have no estimate on when Mr. Lunney will be able to get away at this time. We will attempt to summarize for you some of the discussions that have been going on here. We are still leaning toward the burn at pericynthion plus 2 hours, that is the Descent Propulsion burn at 79 hours, 27 minutes; 850 feet per second [259 m/s] as an option. A number of people are taking a look at the - what is being termed as super fast return, would require a larger burn at pericynthion plus an hour and a half. This would bring us to a splash time of 118 hours vs. 142 hours. However, to accomplish this, we would have to jettison the Service Module. Preliminary data indicates that we may have a thermal problem on the way back without the Service Module. There are also some other aspects that need to be looked into. This option is being held open and is being worked and will be for the next several hours. However, as I say, all the officials here are still leaning toward the pericynthion plus 2 hours, with a 142-hour return. In connection with the super fast return, Astronaut Gene Cernan has been doing some work in the trainer on star visibility problems, manual reaction control, manual throttle work, and this option will be kept open for some time. Another problem with the super fast return is that we can't stand as much misalignment with the inertial platform on a long burn as we can with the 142-hour return. At the present time, we would feel more comfortable with the 142 hours return. We expect to be able to get a program 52 or a platform align, the program for aligning the inertial platform with the Alignment Optical Telescope in the Lunar Module, after the spacecraft arrives in the shadow of the Moon. There is a 30-minutes period where we can look at the spacecraft through telemetry and watch the - how the alignment goes prior to the time that we lose signal. We are 9 hours, 41 minutes away from LOS, but there is a half-hour period when the spacecraft will be in the shadow of the Moon and an alignment can be attempted. If we are unable to align, we think that we can do the burn with the present alignment. The result so far of tracking since the last Descent Propulsion burn indicates that the present alignment is good. We are looking at a plan now that after the burn, we would power down to 17 amps; that's a minimum power down. With that power down, we have enough water to last to 155 hours, Ground Elapsed Time. In addition to that, we would have the water from the Portable Life Support Systems. The water use rate at this 17-amp power usage would be 2.68 pounds per hour. These projections also include two power-ups for mid course corrections on their way home. And a procedure has been worked out to use the Command Module's lithium hydroxide cartridge for CO<sub>2</sub> removal and we are presently yawing manually 90 degrees every hour for Passive Thermal Control; after the burn, we may put a rate into the spacecraft, or roll rate into the spacecraft, and let it go and attempt to set up some type of Passive Thermal Control that does not require complete manual operation. The Flight Dynamics Officer reports that if the burn is a reasonable one, that they would schedule midcourse probably at 24 hours out, instead of 12 hours. That would be an elapsed time of 4 hours. Stand by please.
067:30:10|P|PAO|And we expect communications to improve a little bit after S-IVB impact on the lunar surface; the S-IVB frequency is giving us a little trouble with communications. After the impact we will not have to turn the transponder in the spacecraft off, during handovers between tracking stations. That's the situation as it stands now; we will keep you advised as to Flight Director Lunney's availability. This is Mission Control Houston.
067:32:09|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
067:32:15|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
067:32:16|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. In order to save on an amp or 2 of power here, we'd like you to go to the Down Voice Backup comm configuration, which is pulling the power and circuit breaker and going to Down Voice Backup. If we get into a comm problem, all you have to do is reverse that configuration, and it should be good again. Over.
067:32:50|T|CDR|Okay, we'll go to Down Voice Backup and pull the Power Ampl circuit breaker, and if we get into trouble, we'll come back again.
067:32:57|C|Kerwin|Okay, real fine, and we estimate the next yaw maneuver should start at about 68:02. Over.
067:33:08|T|CDR|Okay. Could you give me that in minutes?
067:33:12|C|Kerwin|I sure can. That's going to be in 29 minutes from now, Jim.
067:33:18|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
067:33:20|C|Kerwin|Okay.
067:33:51|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're in Down Voice Backup and the Power Amplifier is pulled.
067:34:00|C|Kerwin|Jim, Houston. Roger that. You are readable through the noise. How are we? Over.
067:34:09|T|CDR|You are loud and clear.
067:34:12|C|Kerwin|Very good.
067:34:30|T|CMP|Yes, I guess what I asked at this time break out a new switch configuration in the event that something happens, and we have to get ... setup ... setup the comm.
067:34:58|T|CDR|Okay. What else do we have to now.
067:36:18|T|CMP|...
067:36:30|T|CDR|Okay.
067:36:35|T|CMP|...
067:37:21|T|CMP|...
067:38:19|T|CMP|...
067:38:24|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 67 hours, 38 minutes. President Nixon talked with NASA Administrator Dr. Thomas O. Paine at 7:45 am CST today. Dr. Paine, who arrived in Houston by NASA aircraft at 6:40 am CST from Washington, was in Mission Control and gave the President an update on the Apollo 13 Mission. Mission Control is in direct touch with the White House. We'll continue to stand by now for live air-to-ground transmissions.
067:38:30|T|CDR|I guess we've got to bring ...
067:38:35|T|CMP|...
067:39:12|T|CDR|Well, there's a lot of stuff ...
067:39:17|T|CDR|... going off?
067:39:20|T|CMP|...
067:39:28|T|CDR|No. If you could draw battery power for a while, we could go VOX.
067:39:33|T|CMP|It's locked.
067:39:35|T|CDR|...
067:39:40|T|CMP|I don't think I want to do that, do you?
067:39:55|T|CMP|... powered up ...
067:40:01|T|CDR|... got one.
067:40:03|T|CMP|... ... all powered down.
067:40:07|T|CDR|...
067:40:10|T|CMP|... have to get ...
067:41:02|T|CDR|... get our ... are off.
067:41:05|T|CMP|Yes.
067:41:08|T|CDR|... all three ...
067:41:15|T|CMP|...
067:41:25|T|CMP|Seems like if we didn't get the burn ...
067:43:57|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. It's 67 hours, 43 minutes. The Lunar Module is configured in a VOX mode of communication and what you are hearing is the crewmen talking among themselves. They are not calling Houston. We are not in air-to-ground transmission but you will be able to hear the crewmen talking among themselves when they are in this mode.
067:44:24|T|CDR|... ...
067:45:01|T|CMP|If we make it back, then it ...
067:46:11|T|CMP|When we eat ...
067:46:19|T|CDR|Well we're going to have to do something to get all this water out of here.
067:46:23|T|CMP|I'll set up a number of things, before I turn the thing on.
067:46:27|T|CDR|... squared away.
067:46:34|T|CDR|...
067:46:47|T|CMP|...?
067:46:48|T|CDR|Yes.
067:46:56|T|CMP|... ...
067:47:02|T|CDR|There you go.
067:47:06|T|CDR|...?
067:48:50|T|CMP|... this one.
067:48:53|T|CDR|Okay.
067:52:20|T|CMP|...?
067:52:21|T|CDR|That's right.
067:52:22|T|CMP|Thank you.
067:52:26|T|CMP|...?
067:52:28|T|CMP|I'll wake you up.
067:52:30|T|CDR|Go to sleep.
067:52:31|T|CMP|All right.
067:58:37|T|Unrecognized crewman|(Coughing)
067:58:44|T|CMP|About four minutes
067:58:53|T|CDR|Okay.
067:59:07|T|CMP|Go ahead.
067:59:19|T|CDR|...
067:59:44|T|CDR|...
067:59:56|T|CMP|... ...?
068:00:01|T|CDR|Yes.
068:00:13|T|CDR|... Over on the ...
068:03:33|T|CDR|Well, I'm afraid this is going to be the last lunar mission for a long time.
068:03:40|T|CMP|Think they'll stop..
068:04:37|T|CDR|Are we in Down Voice Backup ...
068:04:39|T|CMP|Yes.
068:08:27|T|CDR|Maybe it should reverse itself. I think ...
068:08:31|T|CMP|...
068:08:33|T|CDR|Yes.
068:08:38|T|CDR|Quantity goes down, then it starts goes away.
068:13:24|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 68 hours, 13 minutes. Flight Director Glynn Lunney and four of his Flight Controllers are on their way now to Building 1 for the News Conference. Flight Director Glynn Lunney and four of the flight controllers from his team are enroute to the Building 1 Auditorium for a News Conference. Accompanying Glynn Lunney will be Tom Weichel, the Retrofire Officer; Clint Burton, EECOM; Hal Loden, Control; and Merlin Merritt.
068:17:03|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 68 hours, 17 minutes. An additional participant of the news conference will be Major General David O. Jones, United States Air Force, who commands the Department of Defense Recovery Forces.
068:21:23|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 68 hours, 21 minutes. Apollo 13's distance from Earth now is 200,396 nautical miles [371,133 km]. Velocity 2,919 feet per second [890 m/s].
068:25:48|T|CDR|Aquarius, radio check.
068:25:52|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, this is Houston. Go ahead.
068:25:59|T|CDR|Maneuver complete.
068:26:02|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jim. We show you on telemetry. Looks solid at the new attitude. Just by the way of information, the latest tracking data shows the pericynthion to be holding somewhere above 136 [nautical] miles [252 km], and the PAD you have is still good. Over.
068:26:24|T|CDR|Roger. Understand.
068:26:28|C|Kerwin|Okay, and, Jim, we wonder whether you've attempted to get drinking water out of the Command Module po-ti [sic] tank yet. It's - Is that going all right or do you have any questions on it. Over.
068:26:42|T|CMP|... do it at 169 hours.
068:26:46|T|CDR|We're all setup to do it at 169 hours - or 69 hours.
068:32:32|T|CMP|I need a Command Module activation ...
068:32:38|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. Over.
068:37:52|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
068:37:55|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
068:38:01|T|CDR|As we approach the burn, we want to go through the same check that we did for the last burn. That is, we want to make sure we have everything powered up, circuit breaker by circuit breaker in conjunction with your direction. And we feel we ought to have a procedure for powering up the Command Module again when we have to go back into the Command Module ... communication.
068:38:29|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We copied that. First of all, you want to go through the circuit by circuit breaker careful powered-up procedure for the next DPS burn, and we're working on that. Secondly, you want a procedure for powering the Command Module up again when you have to re-enter it and power it up and we're talking about that and working one up, and we'll get both those for you in plenty of time.
068:39:00|T|CDR|Roger.
068:39:06|T|CMP|Joe, can you also get us an idea about how far out we can expect to make it on the Command Module batteries?
068:39:16|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. It sounds as though we probably don't want to power up the Command Module before EI minus 2 hours. That doesn't mean we can't start our procedure a good deal before that, but we don't want to power it up much before EI minus 2. Over.
068:39:42|T|CMP|Okay. I was just thinking in case something - we had the sort of problem here about how we would go about getting in the Command Module, what minimum systems we need to power up - and - in order to make it back into Earth.
068:40:00|C|Kerwin|Right, Jack. It's quite clear that we're going to have to very carefully make up a full checklist for you on that; we'll do it.
068:40:26|T|CMP|Obviously we're going to have to get power from Aquarius ... it probably be the backup ...
068:40:38|T|CDR|Oh, well, we've got to have something to ... Besides, we can get rid of the LM ... decide then what they'll do.
068:40:51|T|CMP|My guess is what they'll do - Well, I guess, align the GDC ... right here, and get the EMS ...
068:42:21|T|CMP|And  we haven't even figured out yet the ... batteries, have we?
068:42:26|T|CDR|Oh, I'm sure we have.
068:42:30|T|CMP|... - hundred ampere-hours. We had it figured out that we had 550 ampere-hours left. ...
068:42:43|T|CDR|...
068:42:48|T|CMP|... bigger than 133 hours. ... Oh, yes, I guess - Yes, he's ... the descent Thursday afternoon. He had it figured out that - for a splashdown at ... number of hours - 74 hours, and we've figured out that we - I don't know how we arrived at this - but he added up all the ...
068:45:01|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
068:45:07|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
068:45:09|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jim. We just thought of something; namely, that we probably should get the lithium hydroxide canisters out of the Command Module reasonably soon just to make certain that they don't stay in there and possibly swell up until they'd be hard to get out. I wouldn't wake up Fred for that, but it's something you should do possibly before you go to sleep.
068:45:45|T|CDR|Roger. Will do.
068:45:47|C|Kerwin|Okay.
068:47:00|T|CMP|Good morning, Freddo. We're 68 hours, about, and 46 minutes. Did you sleep good?
068:47:17|T|CDR|... lithium hydroxide ...
068:47:19|T|CMP|Yes, I think I'll do that right now. Freddo, get on the comm.
068:47:25|T|CDR|Okay, Jack, take the lithium hydroxide canisters out. Tie them down, or something like that, in the Command Module. And then get us some food ...
068:48:53|T|CDR|How much time did you say these batteries had?
068:48:56|T|LMP|... 800 ampere ...
068:50:21|T|LMP|Aa-ah. Think I'll get an aspirin - a couple of aspirin again I guess will be in order ... headache.
068:50:27|T|CDR|Jack, is going to try get some water by using the SURGE TANK.
068:51:43|T|LMP|I'd like a couple of aspirin, too.
068:51:49|T|LMP|Well, would you like some pictures?
068:54:06|T|CDR|Be sure you get all the water out you can. ... taking a picture ...
068:55:49|T|LMP|You're holding your attitude right now. What time have you got to move?
068:55:57|T|CDR|Probably another 5 minutes.
068:58:35|T|CDR|How much water in the ...?
068:59:30|T|LMP|What time was it when we powered up the LM, do you recall? 58 hours?
069:06:38|T|CDR|How did the water come out?
069:06:43|T|LMP|Okay, ... That's another big bogey man. If we have to start drinking water ... drink damn near a gallon a day.
069:07:54|T|CDR|I'm also figuring that when we've got to go back in there, we're going to take the drogue and the probe back here - take these - PLSSs back in there, and anchor them down ...
069:12:53|T|LMP|Hello, Houston. How do you read?
069:13:27|T|LMP|Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
069:13:34|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston; did you call
069:13:43|T|LMP|Okay, you hear me, Joe?
069:13:46|C|Kerwin|Oh, not very good, Jack; suggest that for communication here, we go to Power Amplifier circuit breaker In and Function switch to Voice.
069:14:03|T|LMP|Okay, I didn't want to get through or anything. I just wanted to check and see if we had you at all in this mode.
069:14:10|C|Kerwin|Oh, yes, we do have comm. You're extremely noisy but if you read loud and slow we can easily copy it.
069:14:25|T|LMP|Okay. Joe, I read you loud and clear on this mode.
069:14:29|C|Kerwin|Roger, we understand that. It is strictly a downlink problem and you can stay in the Down Voice Backup mode if you want. If we get involved in conversation, I think we'll want to go back to Normal voice.
069:16:42|T|CDR|How you doing, Jack?
069:17:35|T|CDR|Do you have an hour on your clock for ...?
069:18:00|T|LMP|Joe, this is Aquarius; wonder if you can give me the GET time of initial powerup?
069:18:13|C|Kerwin|Fred, Houston. Understand you'd like to know the GET of your initial powerup, is that correct?
069:18:23|T|LMP|Yes, the second time in here.
069:18:26|C|Kerwin|Okay, stand by.
069:19:56|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
069:20:01|T|CDR|Go ahead.
069:20:05|C|Kerwin|Okay, we don't have a precise time for the starting of that procedure yet; we are working on it real hard. It won't be for several hours; and we'll pass it up to you just as soon as we get it. Over.
069:20:21|T|CDR|Okay, and, Joe, you want us to start a PTC maneuver at this time?
069:20:27|C|Kerwin|Stand by and I'll check.
069:21:06|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
069:21:12|T|CDR|Go ahead.
069:21:13|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jim. We would like the next yaw maneuver in about 6 minutes. Over.
069:21:20|T|CDR|Roger. 6 minutes.
069:21:22|C|Kerwin|Okay.
069:23:10|T|CDR|Oh, yes, yes. Keep opening - open the jets slowly ... Keep working at it.
069:24:02|T|CDR|Is there some way that we could put water in the PLSS?
069:24:16|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
069:24:21|T|CDR|Go ahead.
069:24:23|C|Kerwin|Okay. Our estimate is that we will start powering up for the DPS burn at about 76 hours elapsed, which is about 6&frac34; hours from now.
069:24:40|T|CDR|Roger, Joe. Understand.
069:24:42|T|LMP|Okay, Joe, about 76 hours or so and I guess you misunderstood. My question was what was the GET way back when, when I first came across to the LM and transferred to LM power? How long have we been living on the LM, now?
069:25:00|C|Kerwin|Oh; Roger. Stand by. I'll give you that. Yes, I just didn't understand.
069:29:28|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
069:29:35|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
069:29:36|C|Kerwin|Okay, the time of transfer to LM power was 57 hours, 11 minutes. For your information, we seem to be reasonably fat on power. In fact, we are looking at a procedure that we might recommend to you later on after the burn and so forth of powering up one of the Command Module main buses via the LM umbilical. This would enable us possibly to charge up the Command Module batteries. Over.
069:30:16|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. That sounds great. I just thought that to pass the time, I'd do a little backseat quarterbacking, here.
069:30:29|C|Kerwin|Roger.
069:34:22|T|CDR|How's the water doing?
069:34:39|T|LMP|How are you going to get it? Press the tank there.
069:35:17|T|LMP|How am I ... Jack?
069:35:23|T|CDR|Take a check, Jack, and see how we should ... amount.
069:47:30|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
069:47:35|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
069:47:37|C|Kerwin|Roger. We request Aft Omni at this time. Over.
069:47:43|T|CDR|Aft Omni.
069:47:45|C|Kerwin|That's affirm.
069:48:35|T|CDR|Yes, okay. So I figured 123.
069:48:40|T|LMP|You mean, 142:40?
069:48:55|T|LMP|Couple of hundred amp hours.
069:48:59|T|CDR|Yes.
069:49:06|T|LMP|I'm trying to ... this heater over here. ... I'll figure that next.
069:49:34|T|LMP|Jim, that ... looking pretty close; a about 86 or ...
069:49:50|T|CDR|Well, ...
070:12:18|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 70 hours, 12 minutes. Apollo 13 now 203,670 nautical miles [377,197 km] from Earth; velocity, 2,910 feet per second [887 m/s]. We'll continue to stay up live for any air-to-ground transmissions.
070:24:52|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 70 hours, 24 minutes. A decision has been made to perform the pericynthian plus 2-hour maneuver. This will be a DAP Descent Propulsion System burn of approximately 900 feet a second [274 m/s], and will bring landing in the Pacific Ocean at 142 hours elapsed time. We'll be passing up to the crew a procedure shortly for them to perform a Sun check in the alignment optical telescope of the Lunar Module so that we may better understand what the present LM inertial platform alignment is. If, as a result of this Sun check, the platform looks good, we will perform the maneuver without a platform realignment. If it does not look good and the limits on this have been defined as plus or minus 1 degree, we will do what is termed an Earth-Sun option alignment before going into the dark behind the Moon, and set up the attitude of the spacecraft so that the crew can mark on a good star while they're in the dark to check the Earth-Sun alignment that they will perform previously. Apollo 13 now is 203,957 nautical miles [377,728 km] from Earth; velocity is 2,894 feet per second [882 m/s]. Jim Lovell, the spacecraft commander, and Jack Swigert the Command Module Pilot have just started a 6-hour rest period. Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise is awake at the present time. We will be passing information on this decision up to the crew very shortly. This is Mission Control, Houston."
070:32:04|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 70 hours 32 minutes. The elapsed time of this planned Lunar Module engine manuever is approximately 79 hours, 25 minutes. We expect to do the Sun check at about 74 hours elapsed time. We're now 6 hours, 36 minutes away from Loss Of Signal, when the spacecraft will go behind the Moon. We'll stand by for any air-ground now.
070:52:15|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
070:52:20|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.
070:52:23|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. I have a few words for you on some things we want to do in the next few hours, and in order to get good comm for that and also in order to give FIDO a few minutes of ranging, I want to have you put the Power Amplifier circuit breaker in panel 16 in, the Voice Function switch to Voice, and Ranging Function switch to Ranging. Over.
070:53:17|T|LMP|Now I'm in Normal voice and Ranging is up.
070:53:22|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. And you're loud and clear down here now. Okay. What we're getting a procedure ready for you is to do an AOT Sun check at approximately 74 hours or in just a little over 3 hours. That will be a detent 2; we'll have a detail procedure up shortly and it will include a Rendezvous Radar redesignation to get it out of the way and a P52 maneuver to the attitude. It's our feeling that if that checks out within 1 degree that your platform will be okay for the burn without a subsequent P52. If it's not within 1 degree, we are working up an Earth/Sun alignment procedure to align the platform, and we'll have that up to you later. Okay. Assuming that the Sun check is okay, we will then give you a star for a confidence check on the back side when you're in the darkness. We'll be updating a burn PAD to you prior to LOS going around the Moon. We'll have another look at you after AOS, and we'll update the PAD if required. Right now that update should be very small. Over.
070:54:48|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by one.
070:55:52|T|LMP|Okay. Joe. As I read that, at 74 hours we're going to do an AOT Sun check at detent 2, which is going to require the Rendezvous Radar out of the way. And we use P52 Auto maneuver to get there, or at least the angles out of that, and if this passes within 1 degree, you're saying the platform is okay for the maneuver, and we won't need a subsequent P52. But even if it is okay, you'll give us a star which we can use for our check when we're in darkness. If this check flunks, you'll pass us on up then an Earth/Moon align procedure.
070:56:45|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. That's correct, except the align procedure that we're working on is an Earth/Sun align, and other than that, that's correct. Incidentally, this PC plus 2 maneuver looks like it will still be around a 900-foot-per-second maneuver and that it will get you back to the mid-Pacific line at 142 hours.
070:57:15|T|LMP|Okay. That was an Earth/Sun check, Joe. We're getting a little close to the Moon now. And the PC plus 2 maneuver still looks about 900 foot per second to get us at mid-PAC, at about 142 hours.
070:57:32|C|Kerwin|That's right.
071:05:12|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
071:05:19|T|LMP|Go ahead, Joe.
071:05:21|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. We got a good batch of ranging and now we'd like you to reverse the configuration, Ranging to Off, Voice Function to Down Voice Backup, Power Amplifier circuit breaker out; we'll be talking to you.
071:05:41|T|LMP|Down Voice Backup with the Power Amp breaker open now. How do you read?
071:05:47|C|Kerwin|We read you satisfactorily, Fred.
071:05:53|T|LMP|Okay.
071:06:17|T|LMP|Jim and Jack are in the upstairs bedroom taking a nap now.
071:06:24|C|Kerwin|I didn't know that was upstairs .
071:06:34|T|LMP|We now have the first space station.
071:06:37|C|Kerwin|(Laughter.)
071:09:04|T|LMP|And, Houston, Aquarius.
071:09:08|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
071:09:13|T|LMP|One other thing you might have somebody look at - I don't want to bother the guys upstairs - the drain hose that we've got in the Command Module, I wonder if we can find out if it will plug into the PLSS and in which case we can keep transferring - later on at least - the Command Module water into the LM via the PLSS.
071:09:43|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. You're almost up with us. We are looking real hard at getting water from the Command Module waste tank into the PLSS, using that hose and then dumping it from the PLSS into the LM ascent tank, and we think it is feasible; we're checking it out to make sure.
071:10:08|T|LMP|Okay.
071:10:29|T|LMP|Okay. I have time to do another maneuver here, Joe.
071:10:36|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. Let me verify that.
071:10:55|C|Kerwin|Fred, Houston. That is verified. You can go ahead with the yaw maneuver.
071:11:02|T|LMP|Roger.
071:29:06|T|LMP|Okay. Just made another maneuver. We allowed for a little too much roll, there. I wonder if that's too much, or should I try to take it out now that I got it stopped.
071:29:18|C|Kerwin|Fred, this is Houston -
071:29:19|T|LMP|Twenty degrees roll left - Yes. Go ahead.
071:29:27|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. I didn't copy the beginning of your message.
071:29:38|T|LMP|Okay, I - I was talking to Jim, there.
071:29:42|C|Kerwin|Sorry.
072:27:43|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
072:27:49|T|LMP|Go ahead, Joe.
072:27:51|C|Kerwin|Roger. Listen, Charlie Duke wants to talk to you - to you about the AOT star check; and, so that we can have good comm, I'd like to reconfigure with the Power Amplifier circuit breaker, In, and the Voice Function switch to Voice and while we're at it, we'd like the Ranging Function switch to Ranging. Over.
072:28:15|T|LMP|Okay. In work.
072:28:47|C|Duke|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
072:28:49|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
072:28:51|C|Duke|Roger, Freddo. Reading you-
072:28:52|T|LMP|Okay, Houston, Aquarius. Go ahead.
072:28:54|C|Duke|Okay, Freddo. Reading you 5-by. The procedure I'm going to read up to you is a - the Sun check for the - to see if we're going to need an alignment or not. If you'll get out your G&amp;N dictionary and open it to P52, page 34, we'll start at the bottom. Over.
072:29:21|P|PAO|The CapCom is Charlie Duke.
072:29:23|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by 1.
072:29:32|T|LMP|Sounds like you broke out, Charlie.
072:29:36|C|Duke|Yes, finally, Freddo. I've no longer got the red spots.
072:29:48|C|Duke|Okay. Stand by, Aquarius. We'll be back with you momentarily.
072:29:55|T|LMP|Okay.
072:31:16|C|Duke|Aquarius, Houston. You ready with your G&amp;N dictionary?
072:31:24|T|LMP|Okay. I'm on page 34 now, looking at P52.
072:31:28|C|Duke|Okay, Freddo. At the bottom of the page, we want step 1, on the flashing 0406, we want an option 3, and that'll Pro us over to 6; and, on the 5025, we want you to do the Enter on the 5025, and that'll bring up flashing 0170, and load in R1, 200. Over.
072:32:03|T|LMP|Okay. Let me see if I'm with you. We call up P52 and, on the flashing 0406, we Pro on a 3 REFSMMAT which leads us to a flashing 5025. We Enter on that. On the flashing 0170, we want to Enter a 200.
072:32:24|C|Duke|That's affirmative; and after that, you Pro on that, and you come up with a flashing 0688, and we'll have to load Noun 88. And if you're ready to copy, I have the Sun half-unit vectors at 74 hours GET. Over.
072:32:47|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
072:32:48|C|Duke|Okay. At Sun half-unit vectors, X, R1, is plus 0.45498, Y plus 19024, Z plus 08250. Over.
072:33:20|T|LMP|Okay. We Pro on - after entering the 200. We'll get a flashing 0688. We then load the Sun unit vectors for 74 hours, which are R1 plus 5 - correction, plus 45498, R2 plus 19024, R3 plus 08250.
072:33:48|C|Duke|Roger. That's good, Freddo. And that'll bring you to step 8, and you get a flashing 5018 when you Pro on the Noun 88. Okay. At 5018, we want to do an Auto maneuver to - to the attitude, so just do the - the Pro with the Guidance Control, PNGS; Mode Control, PNGS, Auto; and we'll take us to attitude. Now, that's going to put us at - at attitude for the Sun check. Now, we're being a 1.4-degree deadband in this program in a docked configuration; so, to help you out, you could call Verb 62 to get your needles - and it - when the needles go through zero or null out and - in that deadband - then you take a look in the AOT and see how close the Sun is. And we want within plus or minus 1 degree. Over.
072:34:52|T|LMP|Okay. So we Pro on the Noun 88, and we end up with a flashing 5018; and you want an Auto maneuver here rather than using the TTCA, so we Pro with Guidance, PNGS; Mode Control, Auto. We've got a 1.4-degree deadband with a Verb 62 will give us the needles to try to zero them in and, at that time I look through the AOT and, if it's like Apollo 11 Sun check, all we've got to have is the Sun somewhere in the - out there somewhere on the Sun as it passes. Is that correct?
072:35:30|C|Duke|I think that's a little tight; that's about a quarter degree. We can go a little bit out of that. Stand by 1. Fred, we'll get you an answer on that one. And also, if you'll stand by, we'll give you a DAP load for this maneuver. Over.
072:35:51|T|LMP|Okay. We'll - You'll give us a DAP load.
072:35:54|C|Duke|Roger. Stand by.
072:37:39|C|Duke|Aquarius, Houston. Freddo, on that - to pass that check, the Sun is at - will subtend an arc of one-half degree in the AOT, so you can be two diameters off and still pass the check. Over.
072:37:59|T|LMP|Okay. It's a half a degree, and so we can be two Sun diameters off and still pass.
072:38:07|C|Duke|That's affirmative. And we want you to maneuver with a DAP of 0.2 of a degree a second. Over.
072:38:19|T|LMP|Okay. You want us to use a DAP of 0.2.
072:38:24|C|Duke|Okay. That DAP load, Freddo, is 31120. Over.
072:38:38|T|LMP|Okay. 31120.
072:38:41|C|Duke|Roger. Now, if we pass that check, you can just terminate P52 right there, and we'll give you an attitude to go to a burn attitude, and from this we can get a star check. If you don't pass, we'd like you to do an alignment at 75 hours. And, if you're ready to copy, we have some Sun half-unit vectors and some Earth half-unit vectors at 75 hours. Over.
072:39:25|T|LMP|Stand by 1, Charlie.
072:40:00|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead for 75 hours - Sun and Earth half-unit vectors.
072:40:05|C|Duke|Roger. First with the Sun; for X, plus 45483; for Y, plus 19053; for Zebra, plus 08262; Earth half-unit vector at 75 hours, plus 32120, minus 34155, minus 17370. Over.
072:40:56|T|LMP|Okay. Sun half-unit vectors: R1, plus 45483; R2, plus 19053; R3, plus 08262. Earth half-unit vectors: R1, plus 32120; R2, minus 34155; R3, minus 17370.
072:41:24|C|Duke|Roger, Freddo. Good readback. Now, on the Earth, we estimate it - if you have to do this alignment, that the Earth will be about a 2-degree Earth. And it'll be approximately three-quarters lighted. Now, to mark on the Earth, we'd like you to take an imaginary line between the horns of the crescent and mark midway between the horns. Over.
072:42:00|T|LMP|Okay. We got a 2-degree Earth that's three-quarter lighted, and we're to imagine a line between the horns of the Earth and mark right in the center of that line.
072:42:14|C|Duke|That's affirmative. Now, on - on this star check - correction, the Sun check, Fred, at - On the 5018, I got some FDAI angles for you if you're ready to copy. Over.
072:42:34|T|LMP|Okay. You're talking about the check at 74 hours GET, right?
072:42:39|C|Duke|Roger. Okay. At 74 hours when you start this maneuver, the 5018 should look like R1 of 2703 degrees, pitch R2 is 0903, and R3 of 2908. Over.
072:43:11|T|LMP|Okay. How about making those all five digit readouts; read them again, Charlie.
072:43:16|C|Duke|Okay. Pardon me. It's 27030, 09030, 29080.
072:43:33|T|LMP|Okay. The 5018 should look like R1 plus 27030, R2 plus 09030, R3 plus 29080.
072:43:48|C|Duke|Roger. That's good readback. Now, we got one more procedure for you; and, right now, we got the Rendezvous Radar stowed and we won't be able to see anything out of detent 2, so we'd like you to position the radar to 0283; and we have a procedure for that. And we'd like you to do that right before you get the attitude. Over.
072:44:22|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by.
072:44:45|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
072:44:47|C|Duke|Stand by.
072:45:25|C|Duke|Aquarius, Houston. On those 5018 angles we had at 74 hours, Fred, that was based on a Verb 49 to this attitude, and they will be incorrect for the two axis maneuvers, so you can just scratch them. Over.
072:45:47|T|LMP|Okay. You're saying the angles you gave me for the 5018, that was for a Verb 49, so they won't be good for the 5018, and we should scratch them.
072:45:56|C|Duke|Thatts affirmative. Okay. If you're ready to copy, I've got this Rendezvous Radar procedure. Over.
072:46:09|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
072:46:11|C|Duke|Okay. It's about a 10-stepper, but real easy. Okay. On CB 16, EPS Inverter 2, Close. CB 11, AC Bus A, Bus Tie Inverter 2, Close. Panel 14, verify Inverter switch 2. CB 11 Rendezvous Radar 2, close. Rendezvous Radar, release. Rendezvous Radar to LGC on panel 3. Are you with me? Over.
072:47:26|T|LMP|Roger. I'm right up with you at step 6. Go ahead.
072:47:29|C|Duke|Okay, Fred. Good show. Step 6: Verb 41 Noun 72, Enter, plus all balls, plus 28300. Step 7: Monitor movement with Verb 16 Noun 72. Step 8: CB 11 Rendezvous Radar 2, Open. Are you with me? Over.
072:48:13|T|LMP|Stand by 1.
072:48:28|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead now.
072:48:30|C|Duke|Roger. Step 9 is a Verb 44. Step 10: CB 16, EPS Inverter 2, Open. Over.
072:48:53|T|LMP|Okay. I got it.
072:48:56|C|Duke|Okay.
072:48:57|T|LMP|Do you want me to read it back now?
072:48:58|C|Duke|I got one more for you. You'll copy this and give me it all on the readback. Okay. Once you get the attitude and you want to use the - you want to get the AOT lamp, we got to go CB 16 EPS Inverter 2, Close; CB 11, AC Bus A AOT Lamp, close. After the P52, you can open CB 16 EPS Inverter 2, and open CB 11 AC Bus A AOT Lamp and AC Bus A Bus Tie Inverter 2. Over.
072:50:01|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by 1.
072:51:10|T|LMP|Okay. Let's see if I got it all. For Rendezvous Radar parking: first of all we want CB 16 EPS Inverter 2, Closed; CB 11 AC Bus A Bus Tie Inverter 2, Closed. Then on panel 14, verify Inverter 2 selected. And CB 11 Rendezvous Radar 2, Closed, both breakers. Then we are to pull the Rendezvous Radar Release handle. On panel 3, we then want Rendezvous Radar to LGC. A Verb 41 Noun 72, Enter, with plus all zips, plus 28300 in registers 1 and 2. Pro on that. Then we monitor movement with the 16 72. After it gets parked, CB 11 Rendezvous Radar 2, Open; followed by Verb 44, Enter. And CB 16 EPS Inverter 2, Open. Now, when it comes time for the alignment to get an AOT lamp, CB 16, EPS Inverter 2, Closed; CB 11 AC Bus A AOT Lamp, Closed; and after the alignment is completed at CB 16, EPS Inverter 2, Open; CB 11 AC Bus A AOT Lamp, Open, CB 11 AC Bus A Bus Tie Inverter 2, Open.
072:52:54|C|Duke|Good readback, Aquarius. We'll - To get those needles on the Verb 62, we got to power up the commander's FDAI. We'll have that procedure for you shortly. Over.
072:53:11|T|LMP|Okay.
072:53:29|T|CDR|Charlie, Jim here.
072:53:32|C|Duke|Roger. Go ahead.
072:53:36|T|CDR|Have you run a Earth set alignment in the simulator with a docked configuration?
072:53:43|C|Duke|Is the question, &quot;Have we run a - an alignment in the docked configuration?&quot; That is affirmative.
072:53:54|T|CDR|Okay. Did you have any trouble controlling the vehicle, and what techniques did you use?
072:54:02|C|Duke|Briefly, to control pitch and roll, use the TTCA, as we've practiced; for yaw, you can use the ACA. Over.
072:54:24|T|CDR|Okay. You have no special techniques going back and forth between the yaw and the X and Y lines. Over.
072:54:33|C|Duke|Not right now, Jim. Dave Scott's been running these things and we'll get them up to you shortly. Over.
072:54:43|T|CDR|Okay.
072:54:44|C|Duke|We think the alignment's going to be okay, so we don't have to do this P52 full-up alignment. We think the check is going to be okay. Like to remind you since you are in Att - if check does not pass, since you are in attitude for the Sun, that we'd - We want the Sun half-unit vectors first. Over.
072:55:07|T|CDR|Roger. Understand.
072:56:14|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. It's been over an hour since we did our last PTC. You want us to do another one now?
072:56:22|C|Duke|Stand by 1. Over.
072:57:09|C|Duke|Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to go ahead and yaw 90 for the PTC. Keep a close eye out on your middle gimbal angle. You're about 30 degrees from gimbal lock, and we'll call you an Omni switch halfway through the maneuver. Over.
072:57:30|T|CDR|Roger.
072:59:27|T|LMP|Okay. And, Houston, Aquarius. You might know when you've had enough ranging so we can get the power amp back off again.
072:59:36|C|Duke|Roger, Freddo. We got one more procedure, and we can shut it down, and that's to get the needles and the FDAI for this maneuver. That 5018 could take you to gimbal lock, and we think it's a good idea to power up the commander's ball. We've got a four-stepper, if you're ready to copy. Over.
073:00:15|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
073:00:16|C|Duke|Okay. Verify that you got AC power; in other words, the Inverter 2 selected and the Bus Tie Inverter 2 AC Bus A, Closed. We'll be under Flight Displays, GASTA, Closed, Commander FDAI, Closed. On the AC Bus A, CBs, GASTA, Closed, Commander FDAI, Closed. Over.
073:01:04|T|LMP|Okay. It's verify we have AC, which is panel 16, Inverter 2, Closed. CB Inverter 2 closed. Then on panel 11 under Flight Displays, we want the GASTA and the Commander's FDAI breakers closed. Also under panel 11, AC Bus A GASTA and Commander's FDAI breakers, Closed.
073:01:25|C|Duke|That's affirmative. Over.
073:02:11|C|Duke|Aquarius, Houston. After the Omni switch, we would like you to get the ranging off, the Voice switch to Down Voice Backup, and the Power Amp CB on 16, Open. Over.
073:02:31|T|LMP|Okay. After the Omni switch, we'll get the Power Amp, off, and go back to Down Voice Backup FTA and the Ranging off. It's your call.
073:02:43|C|Duke|Roger. Stand by.
073:02:55|C|Duke|Freddo, we got about 2 minutes to the Omni switch. You can go ahead and power the Ranging down and and the Down Voice Backup, and we'll give you a call on Omni switch. Over.
073:03:09|T|LMP|Okay.
073:03:19|T|LMP|How do you read Aquarius now on Down Voice Backup?
073:03:24|C|Duke|Roger, Aquarius. We are reading you about the same, about 2-by.
073:03:34|T|LMP|Okay.
073:04:16|C|Duke|Aquarius, Houston. Select Forward Omni. Over.
073:04:26|T|LMP|You got it.
073:04:28|C|Duke|Roger.
073:08:55|T|LMP|Do you read down there, Houston?
073:09:03|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston. We read you weakly. Go ahead.
073:09:11|T|LMP|Okay. Vance, if Buzz or Neil are around you might ask them if they had to use the AOT lamp to shoot the Sun like they did on 11.
073:09:25|T|CDR|Well, where's the ...
073:09:34|T|LMP|Right down below me here?
073:09:37|C|Brand|Fred, breaking in. You're very weak. Understand if Buzz or Nell are down here, you'd like to ask them if they used the AOT lamp to what? Over.
073:09:52|T|CDR|To see the Sun, Vance. It might be possible to see the reticle without even having the light on.
073:09:58|C|Brand|Oh, I see. See if it's possible to see the reticle without the light on. Okay. We'll make a check. And one other thing, you might move that Rendezvous Radar antenna to park any time now. You can start any time you want.
073:10:19|T|CDR|Okay. ... out of the way.
073:10:54|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
073:11:01|T|CDR|Go ahead, Vance.
073:11:03|C|Brand|Jim, Neil is here. He advises that you will not need the lamp on for the Sun check but that you will need it on for the Earth check. Over.
073:11:18|T|CDR|Understand.
073:11:32|T|LMP|Okay. Let's park the radar. Are you ready?
073:11:35|T|CDR|Okay. Let me - First of all, let me see how we're doing here. That's going down. That's better. That's building up. That's right. Let's - Okay. Let's park the radar. How - How long is it going to take?
073:11:48|T|LMP|Not too long. Okay, Inverter 2 going closed. Here, hold the light for me, Jim. Right here on the ... panel. Hold it still. ... AC Bus A Bus Tie.
073:12:13|T|CDR|Okay.
073:12:14|T|LMP|AC Bus A.
073:12:15|T|CDR|Okay.
073:12:17|T|LMP|Bus Tie Inverter 2.
073:12:18|T|CDR|Bus Tie Inverter 2. Closed.
073:12:22|T|LMP|Okay. Panel 16 verify and select Inverter 2.
073:12:28|T|CDR|Okay.
073:12:31|T|LMP|Okay. On CB 11, give me the Rendezvous Radar breakers, with 30-second spread.
073:12:37|T|CDR|Okay. ... at 15, I ...
073:12:45|T|LMP|Okay. ... 30 seconds.
073:12:48|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.
073:12:50|T|LMP|Right.
073:13:16|T|LMP|Okay. Thirty seconds. AC breaker, on.
073:13:19|T|CDR|Okay. Got a big dip.
073:13:21|T|LMP|Okay. Reach up here and give the release handle deployed.
073:13:24|T|CDR|Okay. Okay. She's pulled.
073:13:33|T|LMP|Okay. Panel 3, check the LGC.
073:13:36|T|CDR|LGC.
073:13:37|T|LMP|Okay. Give me a Verb 41 Noun 72.
073:13:40|T|CDR|Still going good, right?
073:13:46|T|LMP|Okay. And they're all zips, 28300.
073:13:55|T|CDR|00.
073:13:56|T|LMP|Pro.
073:13:57|T|LMP|Verb 16 Noun 72 ...
073:14:14|T|CDR|It's going now. Oh shoot ...
073:14:15|T|LMP|Right.
073:14:23|T|CDR|You know what's right in the way. Docking light.
073:14:26|T|LMP|What?
073:14:27|T|CDR|Command Module docking light. Okay. You got them. We're there.
073:14:41|T|LMP|Okay. Two Rendezvous Radar breakers, pull them. ...
073:14:49|T|CDR|...
073:14:55|T|LMP|CB 16 Inverter 2, Open.
073:15:02|T|LMP|Okay.
073:15:10|T|CDR|You know that light on the Command Module ...?
073:15:43|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
073:15:46|T|CDR|Is there any way of get that thing ...
073:15:51|C|Brand|Roger. One correction. We think that the cheapest way for you to maneuver to change attitude is with minimum pulse ACA. That's to do the star mark.
073:16:10|T|CDR|We had - Okay. As soon as possible we'll get that star data. The best way we can get to maneuver attitude by using TTCA.
073:16:23|C|Brand|Roger.
073:16:25|T|CDR|And, just out of curiosity, we got rid of the radar very nicely. And what's hanging right in the middle of the - the forward digit is the docking light of the Command Module. Can you believe that? I don't think it will hurt our Sun check, but it'll sure make P52 awkward.
073:16:53|C|Brand|Sorry, Jim, but we are only reading you about 1 by 1.
073:16:56|T|CDR|Look at that big ... out there.
073:17:04|T|CDR|... out there.
073:18:20|T|CDR|It looks like a piece of wrapping for ... line.
073:18:49|T|CDR|You're watching that. Right?
073:19:52|T|CDR|...
073:21:10|T|CDR|Okay. I guess they can close it.
073:22:03|T|CDR|Okay. Did you read your figures, Freddo?
073:22:06|T|LMP|Yes.
073:22:07|T|CDR|Okay.
073:22:45|T|CDR|Okay. 073:22. What's our next time line?
073:22:50|T|LMP|Crank the thing up at 73:30 ...
073:23:56|T|CDR|Did you get that or did he give it to you?
073:23:58|T|LMP|He gave it to me.
073:24:01|T|CDR|Okay. Because I thought he said 2 degrees per second. Like to check on that.
073:24:09|T|LMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
073:24:11|C|Brand|Go ahead, Fred.
073:24:16|T|LMP|Okay. Jim thinks he heard something different than I copied on the DAP load. Is Register 1 supposed to be 31120?
073:24:32|C|Brand|That's correct, Fred. That was to be 31120.
073:24:40|T|CDR|Okay.
073:24:41|T|LMP|Okay.
073:24:47|T|CDR|And, ...?
073:25:13|T|CDR|We're using C and D, 2, 2, 0, ... is there. Okay. We're at high bit rate.
073:25:53|T|LMP|Okay. Next we power up your ball.
073:26:01|T|CDR|Well, they probably don't know what to do there.
073:26:06|T|CDR|Okay. And, Houston; Vance.
073:26:09|C|Brand|Go ahead, Jim.
073:26:13|T|CDR|Just want to get a time check with you. When do you want us to start powering up the ball? We just got to our PTC attitude.
073:26:21|C|Brand|Understand you'd like to know when to power up the -
073:26:24|T|CDR|We think to take about 15 -
073:26:25|T|LMP|...
073:26:29|T|CDR|Yes. The ball inside the maneuver, we think it will take us about 15 minutes to get there. We'd like you to confirm that.
073:26:40|C|Brand|Stand by 1.
073:26:54|T|LMP|... god damn ...
073:27:28|T|CDR|What kind of technique we going to use ... use the gun in the Command Module or what? To load the PLSS ...
073:27:30|T|LMP|... hose ... Let's see, about 10 or 11 ...
073:31:29|T|CDR|When is that Sun check time supposed to take place?
073:31:32|T|LMP|74 hours, 29 minutes away.
073:31:40|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I'd just like to do the little Sun check. Do you want me to do it now?
073:31:45|C|Brand|Jim, Roger. We just came up with a maneuver time of approximately 15 minutes, so if you start any time between now and about the next 2 minutes it would get you into attitude by 73:50. Over.
073:32:06|T|CDR|Roger. We'll start the maneuver at this time. Okay. Let's go.
073:32:12|T|LMP|Okay. SPS ... -
073:32:13|T|CDR|If we don't keep working, we'll never develop it.
073:32:2o|T|LMP|... flight plan ... now, Power up your FDAI.
073:32:31|T|CDR|All right.
073:32:34|T|LMP|Okay. CB 16 Inverter 2. And panel 11 Flight displays.
073:32:42|T|CDR|Yes.
073:32:43|T|LMP|... GASTA.
073:32:45|T|CDR|Okay.
073:32:47|T|LMP|And Commander FDAI.
073:32:49|T|CDR|Okay.
073:32:51|T|LMP|Now under CB Bus A, your right side of that ... GASTA ...
073:33:01|T|CDR|Okay.
073:33:04|T|LMP|Now ... Okay. Now let's get ready to run this back. P52.
073:33:16|T|CDR|Okay.
073:33:17|T|LMP|Okay. P52, call it up.
073:33:26|T|LMP|Okay, Deadband Option.
073:33:48|T|LMP|Okay. ... Enter on that ...
073:34:04|T|LMP|Okay. ... on this ... load the vector. Okay; R1, plus 45498. Just check that, 45498, that's it. Okay, plus 19024, plus 08256. Okay, now we Pro on this. Okay. Verb 62, Enter. Okay. We now ... and the main ... PGNS Auto ... ...
073:36:09|T|CDR|Houston, are you monitoring our P52 technique?
073:36:20|C|Brand|- Apollo 13 -
073:36:24|T|CDR|Roll, yaw, roll, pitch, and yaw.
073:36:29|C|Brand|Jim, that's negative. We don't have any data on you. Low bit rate.
073:36:36|C|Brand|We don't have high bit rate.
073:36:49|T|LMP|Houston, do you read Aquarius?
073:36:51|C|Brand|Roger. Reading you, Fred. Go ahead.
073:37:05|C|Brand|Go ahead. Houston is reading you.
073:37:06|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
073:37:08|C|Brand|Reading you loud and clear. Go ahead.
073:37:14|T|CDR|Are you monitoring our P52 technique?
073:37:19|C|Brand|That's negative, Jim. We do not have high bit rate data on you now. Over.
073:37:28|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
073:37:30|C|Brand|Roger.
073:37:33|T|LMP|And be advised, Vance, that we are getting several echos in our comm downlink here.
073:37:42|C|Brand|Roger. We'll check into it.
073:37:58|T|CDR|Well, A okay. That old alignment.
073:38:04|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
073:38:11|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
073:38:12|C|Brand|Jim, request you give us high bit rate now. We might be able to fix you up on the 120 antenna.
073:38:21|T|CDR|Okay. High bit rate.
073:38:25|C|Brand|Roger.
073:39:10|T|CDR|And, it's going to be zero, zero, zero.
073:39:15|T|LMP|Yes.
073:39:20|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
073:39:26|T|LMP|Go ahead.
073:39:27|C|Brand|Fred, we can't lock up on your high bit rate. Request you go back low bit rate.
073:39:36|T|LMP|Hey, we lost you there, Vance.
073:39:39|C|Brand|Roger. Advise, we are not locking up on your high bit rate, so you can go back low bit rate. Over.
073:39:49|T|LMP|Low bit rate.
073:41:12|T|LMP|Coming up, right here, James. There it is. Looks like it could be good.
073:41:25|T|CDR|I don't have all the confidence in the world in this Earth-Sun P52.
073:42:18|T|CDR|You know how many times I screwed up on my arithmetic.
073:42:24|T|LMP|Yes. Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
073:42:28|T|CDR|Listen, I'm not.
073:42:40|T|CDR|Sun can be two diameters out, huh?
073:42:42|T|LMP|Yes.
073:42:43|T|CDR|Okay. Tell me what that technique is to get the lamp on, in case I don't see it.
073:42:48|T|LMP|They'll have to give you AC again and you punch in your breaker - Well, let's see - I've still got AC On for the FDIs, so you're in business now. All you need is the lamp breaker, the AC Bus A AOT lamp breaker, that is.
073:43:57|T|CDR|Let me know when these start going. There's the Sun. Give me the - Give me the AOT.
073:44:08|T|LMP|Okay.
073:44:09|T|CDR|Never mind. I, okay. Go ahead. I got it. Never mind.
073:44:16|T|LMP|Reticle brightness, want it up? Got the reticle?
073:44:19|T|CDR|I got the reticle without the.
073:44:29|T|LMP|... Call it, Jack; you can see it better.
073:44:33|T|CMP|...
073:44:35|T|CDR|Okay.
073:44:37|T|LMP|... ...
073:44:52|T|CDR|... jove we got it a great big light.
073:45:00|T|LMP|Yes. I show it about maybe a third of a diameter to the left.
073:45:11|T|CDR|Okay. Take a look.
073:45:14|T|LMP|Check your needles. You're off in roll, Jim.
073:45:32|T|LMP|Pitch and yaw are in, but we're off in your roll needle. Better get that squared away.
073:45:41|T|CDR|Okay. It brings it in. Say when.
073:46:02|T|LMP|Coming in a bit closer now.
073:46:05|T|CDR|Okay. We got it. I think we got it. What diameter was it?
073:46:16|T|LMP|Yes. It's coming back in. Just a second.
073:46:25|T|CDR|Yes, yaw's coming back in.
073:46:40|T|CDR|Roll is just about in.
073:46:44|T|LMP|Okay. Yaw is in ...
073:46:46|T|CDR|What have you got?
073:46:47|T|LMP|... upper right corner of the Sun.
073:46:52|T|CDR|We've got it.
073:46:59|T|LMP|You're hot mic.
073:46:59|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
073:47:01|C|Brand|Go ahead, Aquarius.
073:47:05|T|CDR|Okay. It looks like the Sun check passes.
073:47:10|C|Brand|We understand it checks out. We're kind of glad to hear that.
073:47:17|T|CDR|It's not quite centered, but it's about a diameter, a little bit less - around a diameter, just to one side.
073:47:24|C|Brand|Sounds good.
073:47:31|T|CDR|Now. Let's get the AOT lamp off.
073:47:34|T|LMP|Okay, Jim.
073:47:36|T|CDR|Which ... to get the AOT lamp on?
073:47:38|T|LMP|Okay. Pull the - your AC Bus lamp breaker.
073:47:44|T|CDR|Got it.
073:47:45|T|LMP|Okay. And, Houston, can we proceed with our powerdown now? Getting the ball back off and AOT lamp, et cetera, AC secured.
073:47:57|C|Brand|Stand by on that one for a minute, Fred.
073:48:00|T|LMP|- the ball and get back to our- Okay. What we'd like now, I guess, is the next attitude to go to, Vance, and we will work on getting there while we still have the ball.
073:48:21|C|Brand|Roger. We copy.
073:48:24|T|CDR|As long as they hear you.
073:49:04|T|CDR|Okay. Seventy-four hours.
073:49:14|T|LMP|Yes. We're not there yet, really. Another 11 minutes, the check's really valid.
073:50:05|T|CDR|Yes. Bring your ... down.
073:50:57|T|CDR|Yes Fred. ... It's better in here. Slow now ...
073:51:31|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
073:51:36|T|CDR|Go ahead.
073:51:38|C|Brand|Jim, in a moment we will have an attitude for you to go to, and recommend that you keep your FDI up while maneuvering to that attitude. After you get there, then we will have you widen the deadband and eventually go into a PTC about the burn attitude.
073:52:05|T|CDR|You were cut off slightly, Vance.
073:52:08|C|Brand|Roger. We will have an attitude for you to maneuver to in a moment. And you should leave your FDAI up for that. The attitude is as follows if you are ready to copy. Over.
073:52:26|T|CDR|Got the book.
073:52:32|T|LMP|Go ahead, Vance.
073:52:34|C|Brand|Okay. This is FDAI attitudes for the maneuver. Yaw, 060 degrees; pitch, 083 degrees; roll, 272 degrees.
073:52:59|T|CDR|Let's hve them read that in the R1, R2, R. I don't want Verb 69 Noun 20. I want Verb 49, 58g's so I can fly the needle.
073:53:18|C|Brand|Jim. Those are not Verb 49 angles. Those are strictly FDAI attitudes. Over.
073:53:30|T|CDR|Okay. I understand, Vance. It's much easier if the ball is up to fly the needles; that way gives me, if you give to me in terms of Verb 49, 58g maneuver. We could fly that manually.
073:53:50|C|Brand|Stand by. We'll try to get you a Verb 49 angle.
073:54:06|T|CDR|Flying on maneuvers.
073:54:08|T|CDR|Auto.
073:55:51|T|CDR|On that last check, what did it look like?
073:55:57|T|LMP|... ... ...
073:56:20|T|CDR|This is the first three-man LM we've had.
073:56:25|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
073:56:26|T|LMP|And, Vance, which - What hack you got now on GET?
073:56:33|C|Brand|Okay. Stand by on that, Fred. First, let me read up your Verb 49 attitude, if you are ready to copy.
073:56:45|T|LMP|Go ahead.
073:56:46|C|Brand|Okay. Yaw, 27100; pitch, 35500; roll, 33000. Over.
073:57:05|T|CDR|Ask him if it's cheaper to Auto maneuver there?
073:57:09|T|LMP|Okay. Verb 49: yaw, plus 27100; pitch, plus 35500; roll, plus 33000. And do you think it's cheaper to manually make that maneuver or take the 0.2-degree range and go in Auto maneuver?
073:57:50|C|Brand|Fred, we're recommending Auto maneuver. Over.
073:57:57|T|LMP|Okay. Auto maneuver, and could you give me a GET right now.
073:58:04|C|Brand|Okay. I understand you want GET of the burn. Stand by 1.
073:58:10|T|LMP|That's negative, Vance. What is you clock reading right now?
073:58:13|T|CDR|Here, I'll give it to you.
073:58:14|C|Brand|Okay. When I give you a hack, it will be 73:59, and that's about 40 seconds away.
073:58:27|T|LMP|Okay. I think we will make one last check there with the half-unit vectors for 74 hours before we leave this attitude.
073:58:36|C|Brand|Okay. And I'm going to calculate in the 2 seconds in giving you the time hack coming up on 73:59:00 when I give the mark.
073:58:57|C|Brand|Okay. Stand by.
073:58:59|C|Brand|Mark.
073:59:06|T|LMP|Looked good.
073:59:09|C|Brand|Okay. I understand you got it.
073:59:11|T|CDR|You want me to Proceed one more time on that check?
073:59:15|T|LMP|Roger. Yes, go ahead.
073:59:45|T|CDR|Oh, it's on; it's a center.
073:59:56|T|CDR|That's it, she's right on still. Okay. I have too. That's better than I expected.
074:00:05|T|LMP|Okay. Let's do a Verb 74 and get out of here.
074:00:12|T|CDR|If we can. Go to P00? Okay. I'm going to go to -
074:00:19|T|LMP|49.
074:00:26|T|LMP|Verb 49. Plus 27100. Plus 35500, plus 33000. ...
074:00:52|T|CDR|Okay. That's -
074:00:56|T|LMP|Yaw, pitch, and roll.
074:01:01|T|CDR|Let me see. No, that's yaw, pitch - yes well ... we got to proceed ... That's roll, pitch, and yaw.
074:01:29|T|LMP|Roll, pitch, and yaw.
074:01:32|T|CDR|... yaw.
074:01:46|T|CDR|The roll's going to be down here, but the yaw will be off the bellyband. ... proceed to it, I'm going to proced to it.
074:02:08|T|CDR|Roll, pitch, and yaw, but drift's the one. That would be gimbal lock if it wasn't for being off in ...
074:02:32|T|CDR|And, Houston, I see that this maneuver gives us a roll of 27172, a pitch of 08301. Is that what they gave us?
074:02:47|C|Brand|This is Houston. Please repeat.
074:02:55|T|CDR|Houston, did you give us Verb 49 in yaw, pitch, and roll, or register 1, 2, and 3?
074:03:03|C|Brand|We gave it as yaw, pitch, and roll.
074:03:09|T|CDR|Okay. We wrote it as roll, pitch, and yaw.
074:03:23|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. We read it to you as yaw, pitch, and roll, and we should have given it to you registers l, 2, and 3; but we did not. So register 1 is 33000, register 2 is 35500, and register 3 is 27100.
074:03:52|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. Register 1 will be 33000; register 2, 35500; register 3, 27100.
074:04:05|C|Brand|Hey, Fred? Stand by on that.
074:04:11|T|LMP|Okay. Plus 27100. Okay. Stand by. Right now you can enter ... Pro.
074:04:43|C|Brand|Okay. Apollo 13, Houston.
074:04:49|T|CDR|Go ahead.
074:04:51|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. We sorted it out, and it is correct the way we gave you the first time. So, R1, 27100, and in the LM, that's yaw; R2, 35500, and that's pitch; R3, 33000, and that's roll in the LM. Over.
074:05:24|T|CDR|I agree with you. Okay. 5018, it's there, and 5018, and that's what it will be. Okay.
074:05:32|C|Brand|That's right. That's Verb 49.
074:05:46|T|LMP|Verb 45. 25, Enter.
074:05:51|T|LMP|Okay. Plus 27100, plus 35500, plus 33000.
074:06:07|T|LMP|Okay.
074:06:57|T|CDR|Don't bother now. What can we do about it?
074:07:48|C|Young|Apollo 13, Houston. You better watch that middle gimbal. Over.
074:07:56|T|CDR|Roger. We're watching that middle gimbal. You have as a roll, 27172. Our yaw is - that's register 3 - 3300. How did we get this?
074:08:36|C|Brand|And, Apollo 13. We have a procedure for you describing how to widen the deadband to 5 degrees later on. But stand by for that.
074:08:51|C|Young|Apollo 13, you're heading for gimbal lock. You better stop everything.
074:09:01|T|LMP|Yes, we're back in Att Hold now. We're trying to stop it.
074:09:04|C|Young|Roger.
074:09:09|T|CDR|I'm going to roll it.
074:09:25|T|LMP|Can you give it a roll up now, Jim?
074:09:27|T|CDR|Yes.
074:09:28|T|LMP|Sounds good.
074:09:39|T|CDR|I don't understand why we got that.
074:10:01|T|LMP|... pitch.
074:10:13|T|CDR|Pitch.
074:10:14|T|CDR|Pitch down, aft.
074:10:26|T|CDR|What?
074:10:30|C|Young|Apollo 13, Houston. It looks like Verb 49 maneuver will just take you right through there. You're going to have to go around it. Over.
074:10:41|T|LMP|Okay. That's what we're in the process of doing.
074:10:43|C|Young|Si, si.
074:10:47|T|LMP|We're manually working our way around it, Vance.
074:10:53|C|Brand|Okay.
074:10:54|T|CDR|Pitch is 083.
074:11:00|P|PAO|That's John Young talking to Apollo 13 now.
074:11:02|T|CDR|How do I work my way around it? I'm 58g's, and I want yaw 231, right? I think they screwed up on our - our numbers again.
074:11:26|T|LMP|Zero out the needles; we're heading that way, and then we'll stop and talk about it.
074:11:53|T|CDR|No. Pitch is 83. Pitch should be up here. That's the pitch needle, should be ... What's the number, Noun 52?
074:12:11|T|LMP|Pitch should be 83 degrees. Yaw 60 ...
074:12:24|T|CDR|Roll 232; we've gone the wrong way in roll, ...
074:12:30|T|LMP|... yaw.
074:12:48|T|CDR|Take it around zero yaw.
074:13:18|T|CDR|There comes roll.
074:13:28|T|LMP|...
074:13:44|T|CDR|Okay. What's that read; there's 180 ...
074:13:57|T|LMP|...
074:14:04|T|CDR|... is over here. Houston, 13.
074:14:10|C|Brand|Go ahead, 13.
074:14:15|T|CDR|There's something screwed up on our burn attitude. We're not getting the proper readings on the ball when the needles are centered. I'm not too sure what's wrong. Let's go through this procedure again.
074:14:30|C|Brand|Okay. Stand by 1. Let us look at it.
074:14:31|T|LMP|he FDI angles you gave us, Vance, aren't correlating the Verb 49 numbers.
074:14:38|C|Brand|Okay. We'll check into it.
074:14:53|T|CDR|We know the ball is good. Why don't we just go to 40?
074:15:37|T|CDR|You better watch out; it's heading that way.
074:15:50|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
074:15:56|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
074:15:57|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. To answer your last question, do you have PGNS checklist page 57 handy?
074:16:09|T|CDR|Right, we do. I'll check it.
074:16:12|C|Brand|As soon as you open up to that, I'll explain it.
074:16:40|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead, Vance.
074:16:42|C|Brand|Okay. Under Verb 49, crew-defined maneuver, the flashing 0622 are the angles that we gave you that were loaded. The flashing 5018 actually represents FDAI angles, and so what you read on 5018 should -
074:17:05|T|CDR|Right. That's my understanding.
074:17:06|C|Brand|- should not correspond with Noun 22.
074:17:13|T|LMP|Yes. We appreciate that, Vance. It's just that right now we're trying to follow steering needles that appear to be possibly taking us away from the place we know we want to be in the ball.
074:17:34|C|Brand|Okay, You're tending toward the gimbal lock area again. Heads up.
074:17:42|T|LMP|Roger.
074:18:33|T|CDR|Got to go 83 -
074:18:36|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
074:18:41|T|CDR|Go ahead.
074:18:43|C|Brand|13, request you put in the Power Ampl circuit breakers so that we can take a look at your angles.
074:18:54|T|LMP|You got it.
074:18:56|C|Brand|Thank you. And now high bit rate.
074:19:47|C|Brand|Okay, 13; we're getting your high bit rate now and taking a look at your angles.
074:23:01|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
074:23:11|T|CDR|Go ahead.
074:23:12|C|Brand|Okay, Jim, we just took a look at your angles, and you're looking good here. Your PGNS is looking good. We can't yet explain the attitude error needle thing, but I suggest you continue on in your maneuver.
074:23:32|T|CDR|Roger. Okay. We've just about got roll.
074:26:41|C|Brand|13, Houston. We see you now in the Auto maneuver. How are your error needles looking now?
074:26:50|T|CDR|Okay. They look like they are working their way in, Vance.
074:26:54|C|Brand|Okay. You think maybe they are working right now?
074:27:00|T|CDR|Yes. Because we got a 270-degree roll, our pitch and yaw needles are reversed.
074:27:06|C|Brand|Okay.
074:27:22|T|LMP|Say, how do you read, Vance? ...
074:27:28|C|Brand|Fred, you are starting to fade out. Request Aft Omni, Omni Aft.
074:27:37|T|LMP|Okay. You've got Aft Omni.
074:27:39|C|Brand|Thank you.
074:28:34|C|Brand|13, Houston.
074:28:53|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We appear to be there - at the burn attitude. And now do you want us to change the DAP?
074:29:01|C|Brand|Roger, Jim. We have a procedure to give you for widening the deadband to 5 degrees for the PTC in the next 3 or 4 hours, if you're ready to copy.
074:29:13|T|CDR|Okay, stand by.
074:29:29|T|CDR|Go ahead.
074:29:30|C|Brand|Okay. Verb 21, Noun 01, Enter; 3011, Enter; 44, Enter. Now, that's the procedure for widening the deadband to 5 degrees with the DAP. Later on, prior to the burn, you would return the deadband to 1.4 degrees, and if you're ready to copy, I'll read you that.
074:30:11|T|CDR|Stand by.
074:30:13|C|Brand|Okay.
074:30:38|T|CDR|Go ahead.
074:30:40|C|Brand|Okay. To return the deadband later to 1.4 degrees: Verb 21, Noun 01, Enter; 3011, Enter; 200, Enter. Over.
074:31:03|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. To widen the deadband, we'll enter a Verb 21, Noun 01, Enter; 3011, Enter; 44, Enter. Before the burn to go back to narrow deadband, it's Verb 21, Noun 01, Enter; 3011, Enter; 200, Enter.
074:31:22|C|Brand|Roger. Readback correct.
074:32:30|T|CDR|And, Houston, I'll guess we'll do this PTC in yaw, and you want them ball powered down?
074:32:45|C|Brand|Stand by.
074:33:06|C|Brand|Okay, Apollo 13. Over.
074:33:11|T|CDR|Go ahead.
074:33:13|C|Brand|Okay, that's affirm. You'll be doing the PTC in yaw, and we'll give you a call at each time you change yaw - yaw attitude. Aside from that, request low bit rate, Off; then Down Voice Backup, Off; then Power Ampl, Off; and then FDAI, Off.
074:33:42|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. On the power down, we go low bit rate; Down Voice Backup, we'll pull the Power Ampl breaker; and we'll power down the FDAI and the AC.
074:33:55|C|Brand|That's affirm. And the AOT, too.
074:34:59|T|CDR|Okay, are you all set for old a -
074:35:02|T|LMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read Down Voice Backup?
074:35:07|C|Brand|Reading you loud - loud and clear now, Fred.
074:35:13|T|LMP|Okay.
074:35:18|T|CDR|Oh, Vance, do you want to stay in this attitude for a certain length of time before we start maneuvering?
074:35:26|C|Brand|Roger. Jim, we'll keep you there for about an hour, and then we'll have our first 90-degree rotation.
074:35:36|T|CDR|Okay. How wide did they make the deadband?
074:35:52|C|Brand|Say again.
074:37:15|T|LMP|You want the other Omni, Vance?
074:37:27|T|LMP|Yes. My forward Omni, Houston.
074:37:29|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston. Forward Omni should be best.
074:37:36|T|LMP|We're there.
074:39:14|T|CDR|I don't see why the hell ...
074:39:18|T|LMP|I know.
074:39:19|T|CDR|I don't know. I don't know where that 5 degrees ...
074:39:40|T|LMP|Got it.
074:39:48|T|CDR|Right.
074:40:24|T|CDR|Oh-h. Look at that thing hit the deadband ...
074:42:15|T|CDR|I'm just going to try and close my eyes for a little.
074:42:19|T|LMP|Go ahead.
074:50:32|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
074:50:37|T|LMP|Go ahead.
074:50:39|C|Brand|Fred, one - one point on the PTC requests that, about an hour or less from now when you make your 90-degree change, that you do it in PGNS Auto as opposed to Att Hold. Reason is that if you're in Att Hold, it establishes a new null point each time you stop the - the maneuver. Over.
074:51:10|T|LMP|Okay. You want us to make the maneuver with PGNS Auto rather than the PGNS Att Hold. Is that right?
074:51:18|C|Brand|Yes. That's correct.
074:51:33|C|Brand|And, Fred, advise that it - it is a manual maneuver.
074:51:53|C|Brand|13, Houston. You'd be using X-axis override. It will be a manual maneuver, but with the PGNS Auto mode.
074:52:07|T|LMP|Okay.
074:52:10|C|Brand|And if you're ready to copy, Charlie is going to be on in a minute with some recommended checklist changes for your upcoming burn. Over.
074:52:25|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by 1.
074:52:26|T|CDR|You got to erase this.
074:53:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. It's 74 hours, 53 minutes. In Mission Control we've had a change of shift. Gene Kranz White Team now aboard. Presently our space digital display -
074:53:19|C|Duke|Hello, Aquarius; Houston. Do you read? Over.
074:53:28|T|LMP|Yes. Stand by 1, Charlie.
074:53:48|T|LMP|Okay. Which book are you going to give me some words in, Charlie?
074:54:04|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius. Which book do you want us to have out? ... the contingency two hour?
074:54:16|C|Duke|Houston. This is Houston, Aquarius. Say again. Over.
074:54:23|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius. Which book do you want me to update here, Charlie, the contingency two hour DPS?
074:54:38|C|Duke|Okay, Freddo, we'd like you to get out the contingency checklist; turn to page 1, the 2-hour activation. Over.
074:54:51|T|LMP|Okay. I'm right there.
074:54:54|C|Duke|Okay. On page 1, the only thing we have to do is EPS Activation, step 2, CB(16) EPS: Display, Close. Over.
074:55:18|T|LMP|Okay. On page 1, we need EPS Display, Close, under EPS Activation, step 2.
074:55:27|C|Duke|Okay. Turning over to page 2, we'd like you to complete step 5 and step 6 with the following changes: Power/Temp Monitor, AC Bus, Inverter 2, then Inverter 1. Fourth line CB(11), EPS: Inverter 2, Open. Over.
074:56:08|T|LMP|Okay, on step number - or page 2, we should do step 5 and modify step 6 second line to read Inverter 2, then Inverter 1, do the last line under that step 6 CB(11), EPS Inverter 2, Open.
074:56:30|C|Duke|Okay. That will be on CB(16), Freddo, but it's Inverter 2, Open. Okay, on the Mission Timer Activation. Do step 1, correction, lines 1 and 2. Omit &quot;set mission timer on CSM mark&quot; and insert a Verb 16, Noun 65, set mission timer. Over.
074:57:04|T|LMP|Okay. We'll do the Mission Timer Activation except we'll set it on Verb 16, Noun 65.
074:57:11|C|Duke|Okay. Proceeding on to step, correction, page 3, CWEA checkout. Step 1, perform step 1. Warning lights will be Ascent Press, CES AC, and CES DC. Under the caution lights, we may have a heater light. And that's all. Okay, perform - under the circuit breaker 16 -
074:57:46|T|LMP|I can't understand you. I'll switch Omnis.
074:57:49|C|Duke|Say again. Over.
074:57:54|T|LMP|I'm going to switch to Omnis here, Charlie, you're starting to break up.
074:58:00|C|Duke|Understand. Switching Omnis. Over.
074:58:02|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read? That's affirm, how do you read me now?
074:58:08|C|Duke|Okay, you're a little better. How me? Over.
074:58:14|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. Coming in loud and clear. I got your caution/warning checkout, step 1, do; the warning lights we'll have will be Ascent Press, CES AC, CES DC. The only caution lights we may have will be a heater light and go ahead and proceed from there.
074:58:32|C|Duke|Okay, good. The component light, we won't have the H<sub>2</sub>O Sep. Okay, on CB(16) right under that, &quot;Heater Display, Close,&quot; you can scratch that out. Perform all of step 2 and perform step 4 with the following changes. On panel 11, under AC Bus B, are you ready to copy? Over.
074:59:09|T|LMP|Go ahead.
074:59:10|C|Duke|Okay. Under AC Bus B: S-Band Antenna, Open; ORDEAL, Open. Under AC Bus A: Tape Recorder, Open. Row 2 under RCS System A: Main SOV. Starting with a Quad TCA; all four Closed.

075:05:34|C|Duke|Roger. Good readback. Okay, continuing on. Nothing on page 6; nothing on page 7. Nothing on page 8 or 9. Nothing on page 10 or 11. On page 12, we want the - to perform -
075:05:59|T|LMP|Hold it. Hold on just a minute, Charlie.
075:06:01|C|Duke|Okay.
075:06:05|P|PAO|We're now at 75 hours, 6 minutes; and show a distance away from the Moon of 5,828 nautical miles [10,793 km]. 13 now traveling at 4,497 feet per second [1,371 m/s] relative to the Moon.
075:06:18|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead, page 12. I'm there.
075:06:21|C|Duke|Okay Freddo. On page 12, we want the MSFN updates. We've got some vectors for you and a P30 PAD. And we'll - when you get to that state, we'll let you know when we want to uplink. Okay. Under &quot;AGS Activation and Self Test,&quot; perform the entire procedure. On page 13, under &quot;AGS Align,&quot; do step 1; under &quot;DAP Set, Gimbal/Throttle Test,&quot; do step 1 with the following change. Under &quot;Throttle Control,&quot; we want it &quot;Auto.&quot; Over.
075:07:13|T|LMP|Okay. I'll catch up here. On page 12, you'll give us MSFN updates, some vectors, and a P30; and we're to do the entire &quot;AGS Activation and Self Test.&quot; On page 13, we'll do the &quot;AGS Align&quot; and under &quot;DAP Set, Gimbal/Throttle Test,&quot; step 1, I've changed &quot;Throttle Control Manual&quot; to &quot;Throttle Control Auto.
075:07:43|C|Duke|Good readback. Turning over to page 14, step 2, we want you to change the DAP Noun 46 to 31021. Then after the Noun 47, insert &quot;Verb 34, Enter.&quot; Over.
075:08:15|T|LMP|Okay. On page 14, a Verb 48, DAP load, Noun 46 changed to 31021. I assume you will give us any updated weights if we need any, and after the Noun 47, a &quot;Verb 34, Enter.&quot; So, I - you're saying our gimbals look all right.
075:08:35|C|Duke|That's affirmative on the gimbals, Fred. Nothing else on page 14. Proceed to page 15, and under &quot;RCS Checkout,&quot; we'd like to scratch that wording and just say &quot;Verify the following switches: Guidance Control, PGNS;&quot; step 3 - correction, it's line 3, change &quot;Attitude CONTROL (3)&quot; to &quot;Mode Control;&quot; &quot;Mode Control (BOTH)&quot; to &quot;Auto.&quot; Verify ACA Prop, LMP Enable; ACA/4 JET, LMP Enable; TTCA/Translation, LMP, Enable. That is all on page 15. Over.
075:09:45|T|LMP|Okay. On page 15, we'll change the heading &quot;RCS Checkout&quot; to &quot;Verify following switches ,&quot; and those switches are &quot;Guidance Control, PGNS;&quot; third line, &quot;Attitude CONTROL (3)&quot; to &quot;Mode Control&quot; now; and then &quot;Mode Control (BOTH)&quot; to &quot;Auto&quot; then ACA Prop, LMP Enable; ACA/4 JET, LMP Enable; and TTCA/Translation, LMP Enable.
075:10:11|C|Duke|Roger. Now stand by 1.
075:10:17|T|CDR|Okay. Hand me the eyepiece. I got Scorpio.
075:10:22|T|LMP|You have?
075:10:23|T|CDR|Yes. And Antares.
075:10:30|T|LMP|Where's the other one? I'll put it back in here.
075:10:32|C|Duke|Hello, Aquarius. Houston. On activation page 16, if you are ready. Over.
075:10:41|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by just 1, Charlie. Jim's going to fish around and see if he's got - he thinks he's got Scorpio, out the AOT now. Okay, Charlie, go ahead. I'm on 16 now.
075:11:01|C|Duke|Okay. Fred. On page 16, perform the &quot;Docked DPS Burn (PGNS),&quot; that entire sequence down - down through the end of the page, except cross out that &quot;CSM Maneuver to Burn Attitude, then CMC - Free.&quot; Over.
075:11:27|T|LMP|Yes. I kind of deduced that one, Charlie. Page 16, &quot;Docked DPS Burn (PGNS),&quot; except we'll forget the CSM maneuver.
075:11:35|C|Duke|Okay. And you can forget the &quot;APS Follow-up,&quot; too. Okay, on page 17, perform all of the AGS entries and at 4 minutes, we got a change. First line, CB(16) Inverter 2, Close; line 2, scratch out &quot;Select Inverter 1.&quot; At - proceeding on down the page, after &quot;Attitude Monitor,&quot; we'd like you to place the Rate Scale to &quot;25 degrees a second.&quot; Okay, proceeding on down four more lines to &quot;Balance Couple,&quot; we'd like to turn &quot;Balance Couple-Off.&quot; That's to keep the upfiring jets off of the CSM, in case we have to damp any rates in AGS, though we don't think we will. Then perform the rest of that page as written. Over.
075:12:44|T|LMP|Okay, on page 17. Do the AGS load at minus 4 minutes; it's CB(11), Inverter 2, Close, and scratch &quot;Select Inverter 1.&quot; Rate Scale changed to &quot;25 degrees a second.&quot; &quot;Balance Couple,&quot; we'll turn &quot;Off;&quot; and, incidentally, on the AGS dampen rates point, it brings up the discussion we'd had before, Charlie, on takeovers. You might discuss what it's going to cost us Delta-V wise, if we get a control problem, to just shut her off and it take 30 minutes to regroup for a good manual burn.
075:13:26|C|Duke|Fred, we already got that story for you, pretty well in hand. We're reviewing it right now. And I'd like to defer that question until later on. Basically, we're just going to shut down and take what we got, and we got a midcourse of about - the maximum of 5 foot per second, anywhere in the burn to get back to free return. That - that's basically the story. We'll give you the mission rules for this burn momentarily. I'd like to proceed on to page 18, at minus 1 minute, scratch &quot;Master Arm - On.&quot; Stand by.
075:14:07|T|LMP|Okay, on page 18, and I've already done that at 1 minute; &quot;Master Arm - On,&quot; I'll scratch -
075:14:14|T|CDR|- Slipped that ... and I won't have anything to do -
075:14:15|T|LMP|- I've already scratched &quot;CB(16) Abort Stage Close&quot; for the previous burn.
075:14:20|C|Duke|Okay. We want you to close the CB(16) Abort Stage. Over.
075:14:33|T|LMP|Okay. You got some special reason for that?
075:14:36|C|Duke|Yes, sir. We like - In case we don't get a manual On - I mean, an Auto On, we're going to back up using the abort stage in the descent engine command override at ignition plus 1 second. Backing up to page 17, at minus 4 minutes, you read &quot;CB(11) Inverter 2,&quot; it should be &quot;CB(16) Inverter 2.&quot; Over.
075:15:03|T|LMP|Okay, I got you, Charlie. 17, &quot;CB(16) Inverter 2, Close.
075:15:08|C|Duke|Okay, back to page 18. We'll continue on as is at 30 seconds, 10 seconds, 7 seconds, minus 5 seconds. At &quot;ignition,&quot; no ignition and we'll add here, &quot;no ignition, Start pushbutton - push; still no ignition, Descent Engine Command Override, On.&quot; Over.
075:15:45|T|CDR|I got it out there, but I can't get to see it closer.
075:15:58|T|LMP|Okay, on panel - on page 18, right on down the line, everything holds until after &quot;ignition&quot;; &quot;if no ignition, Start pushbutton - push; still no ignition, Descent Engine Command Override switch On.
075:16:14|C|Duke|Okay, good readback, Freddo. At plus 15 seconds, scratch &quot;Master Arm - Off;&quot; and at - proceeding on down to &quot;At Engine Cutoff,&quot; it's - after the &quot;Mode Control: PGNS to Att Hold,&quot; we'd like a &quot;Verb 76,&quot; and the &quot;Damp Excessive Rates via the LM Y, Z Translation.&quot; Over.
075:16:48|T|LMP|Okay, scratch &quot;Master Arm - Off&quot; at plus 15, and &quot;At Engine Cutoff&quot; after &quot;Mode Control: PGNS - Att Hold,&quot; we want a &quot;Verb 76 Enter,&quot; and &quot;Damp Excessive rates via LM Y, Z translation.&quot; And a question on the - propellant quantity, we expect it to get down below 37 percent on this burn. Does that compare with that burn time when you get down to it.
075:17:16|C|Duke|That's negative. At this - this burn, we're looking at - not reaching 37 percent, so I don't think we'll have to perform that step. We will verify that for you. Okay. One other statement: &quot;At Engine Cutoff, if manual start, then at 30 feet per second to go, throttle to 40 percent. At Delta-V equals zero, stop pushbutton, push.&quot; Over.
075:18:11|T|LMP|Okay, Charlie. If a manual start, that was throttle to 40 percent at - Was that 30 foot per second to go?
075:18:19|C|Duke|That's affirmative. At 30 foot per second to go.
075:18:29|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston -
075:18:30|T|LMP|Okay. Then it's stop pushbutton at V<sub>GO</sub> equals zero?
075:18:36|C|Duke|That's affirmative. What we want to do, if we got a manual start, we're going to have to shut down manually, and, to get a better guided cutoff at 30 foot per second to go, we want you to throttle at 40 and acceleration is within reason there, and we feel like we can get a good manual cut-off. Over.
075:18:56|T|LMP|Okay.
075:18:59|C|Duke|Okay. Now, Fred, that was good in the checklist. That's all. We'll have the powerdown checklist for you momentarily, and we'd like to ask you if you plan to use the DPS burn card. If you do, we have some changes to that. Over.
075:19:20|T|LMP|Okay. Let me get a hold of this and I'll write them on there, I got this right now.
075:19:26|C|Duke|Let me know when you are ready to copy. Over.
075:19:31|T|LMP|I'm ready.
075:19:32|C|Duke|Okay. The first two lines are okay. CB - third line, CB(11) and (16): Stab/Control, all Closed except CB(11) AEA, Open; Abort Stage, Open; AELD, Open. CB(16) AELD, Open. Over.
075:20:09|T|LMP|Okay, on the DPS burn card, third line should read CB(11) and (16): Stab/Control CBs all Closed, except CB(11) AEA, Open; Abort Stage, Open; AELD, Open; CB (16) AELD, Open.
075:20:25|C|Duke|Okay. Good readback. Proceeding on down the page. &quot;Balance Couple&quot; switch, &quot;Balance Couple, Off.&quot; Okay, down to the TTCA - it's the last line before minus 2 minutes - &quot;TTCA Commander Throttle, Minimum; LMP TTCA to Jets.&quot; At minus 2 minutes, scratch &quot;400 plus 1.&quot; At minus 1 minute, scratch &quot;Master Arm, On.&quot; At minus 10 seconds, add &quot;Manual Ullage.&quot; At plus 5 seconds, scratch &quot;Descent Engine Command Override, On;&quot; add &quot;TTCA, 40 percent.&quot; Okay, the same comments apply about the manual start: &quot;At the ignition time, if no start, manual Start pushbutton, push; if still no start, Descent Engine Command Override, On.&quot; And the same comments apply to shutting down at manual start. Over.
075:21:54|T|LMP|Okay. The same comments. I'll start at the top again here. Okay. &quot;Balance Couple&quot; should be changed to &quot;Off.&quot; Under TTCA, it should be &quot;LMP TTCA&quot; to &quot;Jets.&quot; Scratch &quot;400 plus 1&quot; at minus 2; scratch &quot;Master Arm, On&quot; at minus 1. Add at minus 10 seconds &quot;Manual Ullage&quot;; add ignition - can add the comment about &quot;If no start, Start pushbutton, push; still no start, Descent Engine Command Override, On.&quot; At the plus 5-second point, scratch &quot;Descent Engine Command Override, On,&quot; and add &quot;TTCA to 40 percent,&quot; and the same comment applies at engine stop to perform.
075:22:39|T|LMP|We really don't use this card at that time.
075:22:42|C|Duke|Roger, Freddo. Now we aren't - also at minus 30 seconds, we aren't looking at an AGS burn so you can scratch &quot;Abort pushbutton, push,&quot; and at Delta-V equal to zero, scratch &quot;Abort pushbutton, reset.&quot; Over.
075:22:58|P|PAO|We estimate the change of shift briefing to start in about 10 minutes. Dr. Paine will be available to meet with newsmen in the auditorium immediately after the change of shift briefing.
075:23:02|T|LMP|Okay. Minus 30 for AGS burn, &quot;Abort pushbutton, push&quot; is scratched, and at Delta-V equals zero, &quot;Abort pushbutton, reset&quot; is scratched.
075:23:11|C|Duke|Okay, you got it, babe. We'll have some mission rules for you momentarily, and the powerdown checklist and also a PTC setup. Over.
075:23:24|T|LMP|Okay.
075:23:27|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
075:23:29|C|Duke|Go ahead, Jim. Over.
075:23:34|T|CDR|Roger. Be advised I'm now seeing Antares and Nunki in the AOT, and I just wanted to know whether you want me to try to do a P52.
075:23:48|T|Duke|Roger. Stand by. We copy the stars you are seeing. Stand by on a P52.
075:23:56|T|LMP|Not very far apart. Put the card back up, Jim -
075:24:01|T|CDR|It's better than Antares and Shaula.
075:24:05|T|LMP|Yes. Sure is. That's right.
075:24:06|P|PAO|That's Jim Lovell reporting star sightings through the eyepiece of, in the Lunar Module. We're at 75 hours, 24 minutes.
075:24:16|T|CDR|We ... LM ... I'll do an Auto P52 to Antares. That's the way I'll get it up there.
075:24:23|C|Duke|Hey, Houston - correction - Aquarius, Houston. We're satisfied with our present alignment. We don't want you to waste any more RCS gas trying to do this P52, and be advised you guys are hot mike, if you haven't heard. Over.
075:24:44|T|CDR|Okay, understand.
075:24:47|T|CDR|How's your memory there, Charlie?
075:24:51|T|Duke|Okay, we're putting Vance back on. Stand by.
075:25:10|T|CDR|What was that -
075:25:20|T|CDR|Okay, okay, let's go back to that P52 attitude, the burn attitude.
075:25:26|T|LMP|The burn attitude?
075:25:28|T|CDR|Yes. I want to make sure I got it.
075:25:30|T|LMP|Oh, you strayed off?
075:25:31|T|CDR|Yes.
075:25:34|T|LMP|Okay, let's see where we are right now. Okay. You want these numbers? Or do you want the numbers from PADs.
075:25:48|T|LMP|PADs. You got the G&amp;N dictionary?
075:25:51|T|CDR|I got 13 20 going now.
075:25:57|T|LMP|Wait a minute.
075:26:03|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 75 hours, 26 minutes. Apollo 13, now 4,968 nautical miles [9,201 km] out from the Moon; traveling at a speed of 4,631 feet per second [1,412 m/s].
075:26:10|T|CDR|... Just a ... These are those 13 20 angles here. Up here. Right here.
075:26:55|T|CDR|Hey, great.
075:27:20|T|LMP|One on. And Houston, Aquarius.
075:27:27|C|Brand|Go ahead, Fred.
075:27:32|T|LMP|Oh, about how long we got before we're going to have to go to work here, Vance. Kind of like to get a bite to eat, maybe.
075:27:40|C|Brand|Okay. We have a - a couple of PADs to give you and stand by. Let's - we'll check to see if we have anything else.
075:27:56|T|LMP|Hold on to that, baby. Where's that G&amp;N book? You got it over there?
075:28:02|T|CDR|Here we go. Here, you want me to start copying -
075:28:06|T|LMP|- off the bag -
075:28:07|T|CDR|- off there.
075:28:09|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
075:28:11|T|LMP|No, you've got it right here.
075:28:14|T|CDR|Go ahead.
075:28:15|C|Brand|Okay. About all we have to do is to send up your state vectors and target loads, and that will have to wait a couple of minutes until we get ready to do so. And if you're ready to copy, I can give you the P30 maneuver PAD for PC plus 2, and after that, probably you should eat and then we'll regroup again to send up other things. Over.
075:28:45|T|LMP|Okay. I'm ready to copy a P30, a PC plus 2.
075:28:49|C|Brand|Okay. Okay, this is a preliminary P30 LM maneuver PC plus 2. Starting Noun 33: 079:27:40.07; plus 0819.2, minus 0020.0, minus 0218.9; NA; plus 0020.9, 0848.2; 420, 274, 082; plus 0820.3, minus 0020.0, minus 0215.0. Comments. Ullage is two jets for 10 seconds. CSM weight, 62480. LM weight 33576. And the following is the DPS throttle profile: 5 seconds at minimum followed by 21 seconds at 40 percent, and the remainder at Max. Over.
075:31:21|T|LMP|Okay. PC plus 2. 079:27:40.07; plus 0819.2, minus 0020.0, minus 0218.9; N/A; plus 0020.9, 0848.2; 420, 274, 082; plus 0820.3, minus 0020.0, minus 0215.0; the rest N/A. Under remarks: ullage, two jets, 10 seconds; CSM weight, 62480; LM weight, 33576. DPS throttle profile: 5 seconds at idle; 21 seconds at 40 percent; remainder at Max.
075:32:50|C|Brand|Roger; that's correct, Fred. If you'll take out a maneuver PAD, I'll give you some landing information. Over.
075:33:04|T|LMP|Okay, you're talking in the CSM update book?
075:33:08|C|Brand|Yes, that's affirm.
075:33:13|T|LMP|You got it right here. Make sure and scratch the ... -
075:33:19|T|CDR|... -
075:33:20|T|LMP|- out.
075:33:43|T|LMP|Okay, which - which one we want? P37?
075:33:50|T|CDR|What kind of a maneuver PAD do you want, Vance?
075:33:54|C|Brand|This is a CSM maneuver PAD for - to monitor PC plus 2. And it's going to be mainly blank except I want to give you your Noun 61 latitude and longitude, range to go for the EMS and that sort of thing.
075:34:15|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
075:34:18|C|Brand|Okay, at the top, purpose is monitor PC plus 2; everything is blank until you get down to Noun 61. Latitude as follows: minus 21.47, minus 165.00; 1166.0, 36291, 142:39:20. Over.
075:35:07|T|LMP|Okay, monitor PC plus 2 PAD. Noun 81: minus 21.47, minus 165.00; 1166.0, 36291, 142:39:20.
075:35:28|C|Brand|Roger; that's correct, Freddo. And we - now would like to get you in a configuration to uplink your state vector and target load. So, if you're ready to copy, I have some circuit breaker changes for you. Over.
075:35:47|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
075:35:50|C|Brand|Okay, circuit breaker panel 11 Updata Link, Close; Primary Power Ampl, panel 16, Close; Voice Function to Voice; Range - Rangine Function to Ranging; TM bit rate, Hi; and then P00 and Data.
075:36:03|P|PAO|We have a reminder announcement, the change of shift briefing is be - ready to start right now. The participants are in the Auditorium. Ready to start right now.
075:36:28|T|LMP|Okay, we're now in P00 and Data, and switches and breakers are configured. You got it.
075:36:32|T|Brand|Okay, thank you. You're coming in loud and clear.
075:37:08|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 75 hours, 37 minutes. That preliminary PC plus 2 hour PAD indicated a time of ignition for the DPS burn of 79 hours, 27 minutes, 40 seconds. Burn duration; 4 minutes, 20 seconds. Delta-V, 850 feet per second. Standing by, continuing to monitor; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
075:38:32|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston, 75 hours, 38 minutes. Our LOS clock in Mission Control shows we're 1 hours, 29 minutes, 45 seconds from time of Loss Of Signal from 13 as the spacecraft passes over the back side of the Moon. This is Apollo Control, Houston; continuing to monitor.
075:43:36|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
075:43:42|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
075:43:44|C|Brand|Hey, Jim, I have about three things. First thing, the computer is yours again. The second thing, no PTC maneuvering will be required from now until burn, so you can just sit in the burn attitude. And the third thing is we'd like to back out of this procedure we just put you into to updata link, which would mean going from TM bit rate Hi back to Lo, Ranging to Off, Voice to Down Voice, Primary Power Ampl to Close.
075:44:25|T|LMP|Hold up, Vance.
075:44:26|C|Brand|Okay.
075:44:29|T|CDR|We have a Program Alarm, Vance. 1106.
075:44:38|C|Brand|Stand by -
075:44:39|T|LMP|- that high bit rate.
075:44:49|T|LMP|Okay, that apparently was just my putting the Updata Link switch Off that set that bit.
075:44:54|C|Brand|Roger. We concur on that. And I'll read this back to you a little more slowly, Fred.
075:45:05|C|Brand|Okay, are you ready to copy?
075:45:06|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
075:45:07|C|Brand|Okay. TM bit rate to Lo; Ranging to Off, Voice to Down Voice, Primary Power Ampl to Off - that's on panel 16 - and - or Open - and circuit breaker 11 Updata Link to Close - or to Open. Over.
075:46:16|T|LMP|Okay, Vance, how do you read on Down Voice Backup now?
075:46:20|C|Brand|Okay, Fred, reading you loud and clear now.
075:46:26|T|LMP|Okay. I've got the Power Ampl off, Down Voice Backup, PCM to Lo bit rate, and the Updata Link breaker on 11 is pulled.
075:46:47|C|Brand|Okay. Copy. Thank you.
075:47:16|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
075:47:21|T|CDR|Go ahead.
075:47:22|C|Brand|Okay. On this last readback, we'd just like to verify that the Primary Power Ampl was pulled opened. Over.
075:47:37|T|LMP|That's affirm. I used the breaker on 16, Primary S-Band Power Ampl breaker is Open.
075:47:44|C|Brand|Okay. Thank you.
075:47:52|P|PAO|The program alarm 1106 is in the computer and it's for uplink too fast. The indication was there when Jim Lovell took over the computer that possibly he flipped a switch too fast. Looking at our DSKY - our computer displays in Mission Control, we noticed that a program alarm has been showing from an earlier event that occurred yesterday evening. It was not unexpected. We're at 75 hours, 48 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
075:48:56|P|PAO|- 75 hours, 49 minutes; Apollo 13.
075:49:00|T|CDR|Boy, we must be getting pretty close to the Moon.
075:49:03|T|LMP|What's that?
075:49:19|T|CDR|It's in a Att Hold.
075:49:21|T|LMP|Five degrees.
075:50:24|T|LMP|Hey, Jack. Could you bring me down one of these spring loaded hooks.
075:50:37|T|LMP|And another one, because we'll need two of them I guess.
075:50:49|T|LMP|...
075:50:52|T|CDR|Yes. I've been meaning to think about that, yes.
075:51:05|T|CDR|You know where there's some more water?
075:51:07|T|LMP|What's that?
075:51:09|T|CDR|You know where there's some more water?
075:51:10|T|LMP|Where?
075:51:11|T|CDR|The LGC.
075:51:18|T|LMP|Yes. LCG.
075:51:22|T|CDR|LCG.
075:51:56|T|LMP|... there she is down there.
075:54:19|T|CMP|Pretty close? How's the hoses coming?
075:54:35|T|CDR|That screen goes - goes on - Fred's hose up there.
075:54:39|T|LMP|Yes. Here, take that one. ... another few minutes ...
075:54:49|T|LMP|Let's not forget to haul these out of here.
075:55:03|T|LMP|Thank you.
075:55:04|T|CDR|Get the hose screens?
075:55:06|T|CDR|Yes.
075:55:10|T|CDR|I'll was thinking what to dump ...
075:55:12|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?
075:55:33|T|LMP|Hello, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?
075:55:37|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Loud and clear.
075:55:42|T|LMP|Okay. Vance, I guess I understood you all were amassing a couple of - list of things that you were thinking about later on - we'd be taking back from the LM across into the CSM. A couple of items to add to that list, we've pilfered the - the intake hose screens out of the CSM and we have them mounted on the LM hoses now to catch the debris in here. We probably ought to take those back.
075:56:16|C|Brand|Okay. We got that. Intake hose screens.
075:57:10|C|Brand|I guess that item isn't going to change your c.g. too much, Freddo.
075:57:19|T|LMP|Let's hope not.
075:57:37|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; 75 hours, 58 minutes now into the flight. Apollo 13 presently at 3,573 nautical miles [6,617 km] out from the Moon, traveling at a velocity of 4,943 feet per second [1,507 m/s]. Our clock in Mission Control shows we're 1 hour, 10 minutes, 30 seconds away from time of Loss Of Signal as Aquarius and Odyssey pass above the backside of the Moon. 75 hours, 58 minutes; continuing to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
075:58:25|T|CDR|... getting the Command Module water.
075:58:32|T|LMP|Yes. No, I haven't.
075:58:59|T|LMP|Yes.
076:01:18|T|CMP|... Get out one of those big JETT bags.
076:01:27|T|CDR|Much debris in there?
076:01:29|T|LMP|Yes.
076:01:30|T|CDR|Trying to put debris in?
076:01:31|T|LMP|Yes.
076:01:34|T|LMP|... Jim. Ready to go.
076:03:53|T|LMP|How's that for ... [Laughter].
076:04:21|T|LMP|... didn't see any ...
076:04:53|T|CDR|Yes. Oh, what I'd like to do is find out how many - Yes - What happened to the two little midcourses that's got to be with this vehicle.
076:04:58|T|LMP|Yes. ...
076:05:03|T|CDR|Now we just take the CSM and strip it down. Start putting the major stuff in here.
076:05:14|T|LMP|Why are you worrying about that? Why are you worried about stripping down the vehicle?
076:05:19|T|CDR|Well, you don't want - You don't want the drogue and the probe in.
076:05:23|T|LMP|Oh, yes.
076:05:26|T|CDR|And, you want room for the PLSSs. So, we're going to have to take the suits out and put them in there.
076:05:43|T|CMP|General principle...
076:05:47|T|CDR|Well, the suit hooked up with the oxygen in the cabin.
076:05:57|T|LMP|Yes ... before ...
076:06:04|T|CDR|(Clears throat) We're not planning to reenter with suits.
076:06:17|T|CDR|The only way a suit would help you out is for protection.
076:06:20|T|LMP|Yes, ...
076:06:41|T|CDR|They work on the Repress valve.
076:06:43|T|CMP|Yes, ...
076:06:59|T|LMP|You know ... suit ...
076:07:10|T|CDR|Breathe through the canister.
076:07:11|T|CMP|...
076:07:14|T|CDR|Yes, breathe through the canister.
076:08:12|T|CMP|My job is to maintain sleep restraints.
076:08:21|T|CMP|You got all those things ...?
076:08:24|T|CDR|I did.
076:10:45|T|LMP|... cannisters.
076:10:48|T|CMP|Yes, I think they forgot that.
076:10:54|T|CDR|Sun must be coming back.
076:10:57|T|CMP|Yes. ...
076:11:12|T|CDR|Yes, I got two stars, we're coming back, Nunki and Antares getting back up again.
076:11:45|T|CMP|Actually, you can just see ... darkness ...
076:12:04|T|CMP|What? Huh?
076:12:30|T|CMP|That's the one you put up there, ... I would like to, yes ...
076:12:39|T|CDR|Ready to trade it in.
076:12:40|T|CMP|Right.
076:12:42|T|CDR|Doesn't that also fit this big container back here?
076:12:46|T|CMP|...
076:12:48|T|CDR|Well that's the one we want to put urine in.
076:12:56|T|CMP|I wouldn't mind - dumping this ...
076:13:08|T|CMP|Okay. ...
076:13:45|T|CMP|... seems to me.
076:13:57|T|CMP|Guaranteed to work.
076:14:07|T|LMP|Okay. ...
076:14:12|T|CDR|Hey, can't you fill some more in there? Yes. ...
076:14:18|T|CMP|... what you do - what you do, you put your -
076:14:36|T|CMP|Not bad ...
076:14:56|T|CDR|Now, let's see, this burn's essentially to our back, I suppose. Let's hope it works.
076:15:49|T|CDR|Okay, let's see. What should we be doing here now?
076:15:56|T|CDR|Okay. The next thing is to power up for the burn. Did they give you a time to start powerup?
076:16:01|T|LMP|No. ...
076:16:08|T|CMP|Yes, we ought to get a AOS. You know, we ought to get AOS -
076:16:16|T|CDR|I will.
076:16:17|T|CMP|- ... time ... power up.
076:16:21|T|CDR|Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
076:16:26|C|Brand|Go, Aquarius.
076:16:32|T|CDR|Let's just recap the situation now. We're not going to do any more PTC. We'll maintain this attitude. You have already updated us on P30 load. We would like from you an LOS time, and a powerup start time for the PC plus 2. And an AOS time.
076:17:02|C|Brand|Okay. We copy that.
076:17:26|C|Brand|We're going to also get back with you shortly, Jim, for - with some burn guidelines for PC plus 2.
076:17:38|T|CDR|All right. Very well.
076:18:32|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 76 hours, 18 minutes. Apollo 13 now 2,623 nautical miles [4,858 km] away from the Moon. And traveling at a velocity of 5,277 feet per second [1,608 m/s]. Our display shows an altitude -
076:18:51|T|CDR|Have they powered up the mission timer - the event timer?
076:18:57|P|PAO|- at a closest approach of 137.5 nautical miles [254.7 km].
076:18:57|T|LMP|...
076:18:59|T|CDR|Oh, I see. Are they going to?
076:22:13|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
076:22:20|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
076:22:22|C|Brand|Jim, we were just discussing burn star monitoring and we were curious to know if you can see Nunki in detent 2 at this time. Over.
076:22:45|T|CDR|That's affirmative. I can see Nunki in detent 2,
076:22:49|C|Brand|Okay. Thank you. Roughly, in what part of the field of view?
076:23:01|T|CDR|Nunki is in the upper right-hand corner.
076:23:05|C|Brand|Okay. Thank you.
076:23:10|T|CDR|And Scorp - And Antares is barely visible in the bottom of the field of view.
076:23:17|C|Brand|Okay.
076:24:24|T|CMP|Yup, you're right.
076:24:39|T|CDR|Hey, I bet I know how I could get an alignment. Give them a cursor and spiral angle. Instead of maneuvering the spacecraft, I'll give them cursor and spiral.
076:24:58|T|LMP|Do that for AGS, give you a ...
076:25:09|T|LMP|... out of the Earth?
076:27:17|T|CDR|Houston, for what it's worth, we can probably give you a cursor and spiral angle on Nunki and possibly Antares or more than likely Shaula.
076:27:34|C|Brand|Roger, Jim. According to our calculations, Nunki should be, at burn time, pretty close to the center of the AOT. We've been talking that possibility. Over.
076:27:50|T|CDR|Roger.
076:27:55|C|Brand|Also, as a matter of general interest, the Sun should be in - at the bottom part of the CDR's window at the bottom of the LPD vertical line.
076:28:15|T|LMP|Be at T<sub>IG</sub>, which is ...
076:28:19|C|Brand|That's affirm at T<sub>IG</sub>.
076:28:21|T|CDR|It must be that - You're right, because it's behind us now.
076:28:31|T|LMP|Wait a minute, we're holding inertial attitude.
076:28:38|T|CDR|Yes, we're not at the T<sub>IG</sub> attitude.
076:28:40|T|CMP|Oh.
076:29:44|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
076:29:49|T|CDR|Go ahead.
076:29:51|C|Brand|Jim, whenever you're through eating and ready to copy the info, I can send you the burn rules.
076:30:05|T|CDR|Do you want this?
076:30:08|T|LMP|Write them right on - ...?
076:30:10|T|CDR|Why don't you write them right in here?
076:30:12|T|LMP|Okay.
076:30:19|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 76 hours, 30 minutes now.
076:30:22|T|LMP|Okay. I'll start on that.
076:30:25|P|PAO|We show 13 at 2,074 nautical miles [3,841 km] away.
076:30:25|T|CDR|Okay, Vance.
076:30:27|T|LMP|Go ahead.
076:30:28|T|CDR|We're all set to go.
076:30:31|C|Brand|Okay. Okay. First of all, general philosophy is that these rules should be similar to LOI mode I abort with the tight limits. Now, I'll go through them one by one for you to copy. Okay. You should shut down, if any of the following happen. Thrust monitor readout, 77 percent or below; DPS propellant tank pressure - that's the inlet pressure - onboard readout, 160 or below; fuel to OX Delta-P, greater than 25 psi - and that would have to be a ground call to you. Attitude error plus or minus 10 degrees, with the exception of the start transient; attitude-rate limits, plus or minus 10 degrees a second. And you should shut down if you get any of the following alarms: Engine Gimbal, ISS, plus Program Alarm, LGC, CES DC, and if you get an inverter light after switching inverters. Are you with me?
076:32:52|T|LMP|Roger.
076:32:54|C|Brand|Okay -
076:32:55|T|CDR|Affirmative.
076:32:57|C|Brand|And proceeding on. If, during the burn, the engine stops, if you have a flashing Noun 97, you should Proceed, then ullage, Engine Start to Push, and Descent Engine Override On. Okay. Now just general information. If you didn't burn PC plus 2, probably P - C plus 4 would be the earliest MCC. AGS is going to backup in a rate-fail mode only, which you know. We're talking over the star check. Will have to get back with you on that. If, for some reason, there is no PC-2, you have a free-return trajectory with the landing at 152:02:00, and that would be after a small midcourse-5, which would probably be around 4 feet per second at 93 hours. And you have recovery forces in the Indian Ocean; you're in good shape there. And the Indian Ocean is where this landing would be. Okay. You still with me?
076:35:13|T|LMP|Roger.
076:35:15|C|Brand|Okay. After -
076:35:17|T|LMP|Yes. I'm with you.
076:35:19|C|Brand|Okay. After PC plus 2, there are no trim requirements; and, if you have a shutdown during PC plus 2, subsequent midcourse maneuvers required with - Well, the earliest one would be PC plus 4. If you don't do a PC plus 2, but we still want to do one - MCC later, at PC plus 4, the increase in Delt - in Delta-V, or the penalty, would be about 24 feet per second, with a landing in the mid-Pacific at 142:46:30. Now, you should expect new PADs, state vectors, and targets for PC plus 2 at about GET 78. Over.
076:36:56|T|CDR|Tell them to stand by.
076:36:57|T|LMP|Stand by, Vance.
076:36:58|C|Brand|Okay.
076:37:07|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read?
076:37:09|C|Brand|Loud and clear.
076:37:13|T|LMP|Okay. Burn rules. We should shut down for the following: if we have the thrust monitor at 77 percent or below; number 2, if the DPS propellant ullage pressure is less than 160 psi; 3, if the fuel oxidizer Delta-P is greater than 25, and that'll be a ground callout; 4, if the attitude error is plus or minus 10 degrees except for starting transients. Okay. Rate limits are plus or minus 10 degrees per second. And we're to shut down with the following alarms: an Engine Gimbal light, an ISS with a Program Alarm, an LGC, a CES DC, and an inverter light, if it's still on after we've tried switching inverters. If, during the burn, the engine shuts down when the Noun 97 flashes, we should Pro, do manual ullage, and Start pushbutton, push, and Descent Engine Command Override, open. If we don't do a PC-2, our next burn will it be at PC-4 for an added 24 foot per second. We'll land mid-PAC at 142:46:30. Okay. We'll have the AGS up for backup rate command, or rate damping, I guess. And the free return that we're on, if we don't - that we're on now, if we don't do PC-2 or 4, lands us at 152:02:00 in the Indian Ocean. And there's no trim requirements on this burn, and we should expect a new uplink and a new final maneuver PAD from you at 178 hours.
076:39:23|C|Brand|78.
076:39:29|T|LMP|Okay. I'm sorry, 1 - Yes, 78 hours. It only seems like it's been that long.
076:39:35|C|Brand|I can understand.
076:39:42|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; 76 hours, 39 minutes. You heard Capsule Communicator Vance Brand passing to Apollo 13 the mission rules worked out -
076:39:54|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. Your readback was correct.
076:40:00|T|LMP|Okay.
076:40:03|P|PAO|- the mission rules for this burn worked out by Gene Kranz with his flight control team and support rooms in Mission Control. These rules are akin -
076:40:16|T|LMP|Okay. And, Vance, did you ever have any LOS/AOS times, and - and a startup time for us to jump into this activation checklist?
076:40:29|C|Brand|Okay. Let me - Let me poll the house again on that one.
076:40:37|T|CDR|What?
076:40:39|T|LMP|Okay. One word is that the - In an optimum fashion there, going through that 2-hour activation generally took somewhere from about an hour and 15 to an hour 20.
076:40:56|C|Brand|Okay. I guess then we ought to allow you a little more than that, huh?
076:41:06|T|LMP|No, I was thinking that we don't have to do about four pages of it, that we probably need just about that, and that will make up for the difference of any added time we need maneuvering et cetera.
076:41:19|C|Brand|Okay.
076:41:23|P|PAO|The mentioned rules for the burn are akin to those on an LOI-1 with a Service Propulsion System Mode 1 abort assuming that we had no burn, no burn on the engine. We are at 76 hours, 42 minutes into the flight. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
076:42:07|T|CDR|We'll need a - Can I get a flashlight? You got a flashlight. We might need a spare flashlight - Yes. Okay. We might need a spare flashlight: have you got one? Okay. Okay. The Sun has all gone, going down.
076:42:31|T|CDR|Man, look at those stars. Houston.
076:42:40|C|Brand|Go ahead, Aquarius.
076:42:45|T|CDR|Roger. We are in the shadow of the Moon now. The Sun is just about set as far as I can see and the stars are all coming out.
076:42:54|C|Brand|Okay. And if you are ready to copy, we have LOS/AOS times for you.
076:43:04|T|LMP|Flashlight. Okay.
076:43:16|T|LMP|Go ahead, Vance.
076:43:18|C|Brand|Okay. LOS 77:08:35, AOS 77:33:10. Sunrise - First I'll give you sunset which is past, but that was supposed to be at 76:32:45 and sunrise 77:16:48.
076:43:58|T|LMP|Okay. LOS at 77:08:35, AOS at 77:33:10. Sunset at 76:32:45, sunrise at 77:16:48.
076:44:13|C|Brand|Roger. We'll get back with you on the powerup time and, if you're ready to copy, have angles to load into Noun 22 for your Verb 49 maneuver to burn attitude. Over.
076:44:35|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead with the Verb 49 value.
076:44:38|C|Brand|Okay. R1, plus 27210; R2, plus 35570; R3, plus 33010. Second item, as you know, due to maneuver with a Proceed and a Proceed; and, after your attitude, a reminder that P40 will not set you back to a narrow deadband. To get back to the 1.40-degree deadband, you have to use the procedure I gave you, which is Verb 21, Noun 01, Enter, 3011, Enter. And 200, Enter.
076:45:47|T|LMP|Okay. Verb 49, register 1, plus 27218; register 2, plus 35570; register 3, plus 33010; and to get the narrow deadband back we want a Verb 21, Noun 01, Enter, 3011, Enter, 200, Enter.
076:46:11|C|Brand|Roger. And a correction on your - on your first number for register 1. That should be plus 27210. And another commnent; after you get into the narrow deadband at that attitude, why, you might tell us where you see Nunki.
076:46:34|T|CDR|Roger. Will do, Vance.
076:46:36|C|Brand|Thank you.
076:46:37|T|LMP|Okay. And you corrected register 1; it's plus 27210.
076:46:43|C|Brand|Roger.
076:46:45|T|CDR|And would you like us to make that maneuver at this time?
076:47:10|T|CDR|It's down below us, isn't it?
076:47:13|C|Brand|Stand by.
076:47:19|T|CDR|Can't see it.
076:47:26|T|LMP|Can we have some more light in here now?
076:47:29|T|CDR|I have a light.
076:48:20|T|LMP|What do you see out your upper window?
076:48:32|T|CDR|Stars.
076:48:37|T|LMP|Yes. It looks like - looks like the light is coming from around those clouds.
076:48:48|T|CDR|Well, you won't get AOS/LOS until 77.
076:48:53|T|LMP|I guess ...
076:49:12|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 76 hours, 49 minutes. Less than 20 minutes now away from LOS.
076:49:18|T|CMP|Yes.
076:49:19|T|CDR|...
076:49:22|T|CMP|Yes.
076:49:23|P|PAO|Apollo 13 now 1,184 nautical miles [2,193 km] away from the Moon traveling at a velocity of 6,218 feet per second [1,895 m/s].
076:49:37|T|CDR|Let's see, AOS is at 2 hours before the burn?
076:49:45|T|LMP|Just about.
076:50:01|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
076:50:05|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
076:50:08|C|Brand|Jim, we recommend you go ahead and make your Verb 49 maneuver, but just stay there in Verb 49 and don't go ahead to narrow the deadband just yet. And, when you're in that attitude, why, of course, then you can make your star check. And one other item is, I don't think we got back with you, but that hour-fifteen for powerup sounds fine with us.
076:50:40|T|CDR|Okay. At this time, I'll start my Verb 49 maneuver, but will not narrow the deadband, and we will take a look at Nunki. Okay, Vance.
076:50:51|T|CDR|Okay, Fred.
076:50:52|C|Brand|Roger.
076:51:09|T|CDR|Almost, huh?
076:51:46|T|CDR|Yes. Yes.
076:52:30|T|LMP|...
076:52:32|T|CDR|No, it shouldn't.
076:52:45|T|LMP|...
076:52:46|T|CDR|It shouldn't.
076:52:54|T|CDR|I was below that deadline before.
076:52:57|T|CMP|...
076:52:58|T|CDR|That's a good idea.
076:53:33|T|CMP|...
076:53:34|T|LMP|... how many lights you're going to see. Maybe you can coach Jim on that.
076:53:44|T|CDR|Sure. We're there.
076:54:22|T|LMP|Nunki?
076:54:24|T|CDR|Yes. I can just barely see it. I see Antares much better.
076:54:37|T|CDR|Why is the wide deadhand on? Stand by. Is - Is Scorpio moving down?
076:55:20|T|CDR|What's that cloud I see over this?
076:55:23|T|LMP|I don't know. It looks like a Milky Way.
076:55:27|T|CDR|Just a -
076:55:36|T|CDR|Huh!
076:55:48|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
076:55:55|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
076:56:00|T|CDR|Okay. We have completed our maneuver. We're in our wide deadband, and Nunki is close to the top of my display of the AOT. Right now, Antares seems to be more closer towards the center. However, we are in our wide deadband.
076:56:18|C|Brand|Right; understand. We'll have to make a better check later, I guess.
076:57:26|T|CDR|I can't for the life of me figure out what that dark stuff is.
076:57:38|T|LMP|Yes. Did you look at it, Jack?
076:57:46|T|CMP|Yes. Okay. But I didn't recall what ...
076:58:17|T|CMP|Seems weird. Like two black clouds.
076:58:24|T|CDR|Well, you know what this burn is buying us; 10 hours.
076:58:29|T|CMP|Yes.
076:58:32|T|LMP|And how.
076:58:37|P|PAO|Less than 10 minutes away now from predicted time of LOS. We're at 76 hours, 59 minutes into the mission and we see the velocity on our displays for Apollo 13 really building now. Now reading 6,736 feet per second [2,053 m/s] relative to the Moon. -
076:58:54|T|CDR|Might be a good idea.
076:59:01|P|PAO|- Apollo 13 now 750 nautical miles [1,389 km] away from the Moon.
076:59:41|T|CMP|Hey, that's pretty extensive, Jim. You can locate it and get it halfway through the next detent too.
077:00:25|T|CMP|Strange.
077:00:53|T|CDR|It's out the AOT. Well, may be not.
077:01:02|T|LMP|I don't think so.
077:01:07|P|PAO|Seven minutes away now from Loss Of Signal. Gene Kranz going around the room checking with his flight controllers as to a status of systems. We now show 77 hours, 1 minute into the flight of Apollo 13. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
077:03:08|T|CDR|I know what that is. That might be the debris that was thrown out there.
077:03:15|T|LMP|- into the cloud?
077:03:19|T|CDR|It's all dark now.
077:03:24|T|CDR|From the explosion.
077:03:27|T|CDR|Except we made a maneuver.
077:03:30|T|CDR|No, from our explosion.
077:03:32|T|LMP|Take a look. It covers a wide area.
077:03:40|P|PAO|Less than 5 minutes away now from Loss Of Signal. 77 hours, 4 minutes into the flight.
077:03:42|T|LMP|God, that dark cloud. Like a pair of contrails. Only if you switch the detent, they go on around. How long to LOS? Is that right?
077:04:06|T|CDR|I'd sure like to try the detent 2, but I guess our damn platform's okay, isn't it?
077:04:11|T|CMP|Yes.
077:04:17|T|CDR|Yes.
077:04:22|P|PAO|77 hours, 4 minutes, Apollo 13 526 nautical miles [974] away from the Moon, traveling at a speed of 7,122 feet per second [2,171 m/s]. Four minutes now from time of Loss Of Signal with Apollo 13 as it passes over the back side of the Moon.
077:05:03|T|CMP|...
077:05:38|T|CMP|...
077:06:03|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
077:06:09|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
077:06:11|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. We have a little over 2 minutes until LOS, and everything's looking good here.
077:06:21|T|CDR|Roger. Yes. I take it that we don't have to start our activations until we receive AOS from you.
077:06:39|C|Brand|Roger. That's correct.
077:07:13|P|PAO|Apollo 13 now 421 nautical miles [780 km] above the Moon. Just a little over 1 minute now from time of Loss Of Signal with the spacecraft. This is Apollo Control, Houston; 77 hours, 7 minutes.
077:08:08|T|CDR|You give up on edibles? And water? Yes, I heard ...
077:08:45|P|PAO|We've had Loss Of Signal with Apollo 13 as it passes above the back side of the Moon. We're at 77 hours, 9 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13.
077:31:12|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. We're two minutes now from time of reacquiring Apollo 13. Meanwhile, we have an update in the impact of the third stage of the Saturn, the S-IVB. Our latest estimate indicates impact at 77 hours, 56 minutes, 27 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. The predicted coordinate for impact: 26 degrees, 57 minutes south longitude; latitude, 28 degrees, 27 minutes west. Coming up now on one minute to AOS. We'll stand by and continue to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
077:33:21|P|PAO|Standing by now for acquisition.
077:33:50|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
077:34:15|T|LMP|...
077:34:37|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
077:34:41|T|CDR|Stand by for AOS.
077:35:02|T|LMP|Houston, how do you read Aquarius?
077:35:05|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Reading you about 3 by 3.
077:35:43|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?
077:35:49|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. Reading you fairly well now. How do you read?
077:35:53|T|LMP|Okay. I read you loud and clear, Vance.
077:35:58|C|Brand|Roger.
077:38:22|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; 77 hours, 38 minutes into the flight. Apollo 13 has now rounded the corner, headed back towards Earth. We show a velocity of 7,062 feet per second [2,152 m/s] and a distance from the Moon of 566 nautical miles [1,048 km].
077:39:21|T|CDR|We'll, go this way.
077:39:31|T|CDR|All right. We're going up on Mare Smythii, now.
077:40:16|P|PAO|77 hours, 40 minutes now into the flight. We show Apollo 13 at 630 nautical miles [1,167 km] away from the Moon. Our ignition clock shows 1 hour, 47 minutes time remaining until start of the Descent Propulsion System burn.
077:40:55|T|CDR|We'll see, we're zooming off.
077:41:02|T|CDR|Oh, yes, yes, we're no longer 139 miles. We're leaving.
077:41:08|T|LMP|Yes, look at that curvature.
077:41:18|T|CDR|That might be Crisium over there, Fred.
077:41:37|T|LMP|Oh, yes; way off on the horizon, there, yes.
077:41:44|T|CDR|Hey, if you want to use the 250? There's a beautiful shot of - of Tsiolkovsky which we very seldom have.
077:42:04|T|CDR|Well, at this stage of the game beggars can't be choosers, I guess.
077:42:08|T|LMP|Yes, and we can't afford the amps to use the heaters.
077:42:36|T|CDR|Here you go.
077:43:32|T|CDR|All right. You're in zero phase up here.
077:43:46|T|CDR|Are we - back to Down Voice Backup?
077:43:48|T|LMP|What's that?
077:43:49|T|CDR|We Down Voice Backup?
077:43:50|T|LMP|Yes.
077:43:51|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
077:43:55|C|Brand|Go ahead, Aquarius.
077:44:01|T|CDR|Roger. We still want an activation start time for a burn.
077:44:07|C|Brand|Understand. You want a power-up time, is that affirm?
077:44:14|T|CDR|That's affirm.
077:44:21|C|Brand|Okay. Stand by.
077:44:48|T|CDR|Okay. Look it. Let's get the cameras squared away; let's get all set to burn. We got one chance now.
077:44:55|T|CMP|Okay.
077:44:56|T|CDR|We're not going to hack it at 152 hours.
077:45:02|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
077:45:08|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
077:45:10|C|Brand|Jim, regarding the start time for the power-up, you mentioned an hour and 15 minutes. We think that is adequate. This is crew preference depending on how much time you think you need. We would go along with an hour and 15 minutes -
077:45:38|P|PAO|That's the power-up activation time for the Descent Propulsion System engine burn. We're now at 77 hours, 46 minutes into the flight of Apollo 13. Apollo 13 now 872 nautical miles [1,615 km] away from the Moon. Meanwhile in Mission Control Center, one of our special purpose clocks is counting down to the predicted time of S-IVB impact. We show 10 minutes, 30 seconds remaining.
077:45:46|T|CDR|Okay - Okay, sounds good.
077:47:24|T|CDR|Okay, Freddo. You been through most of that checklist for an hour? Let's get it out and let's do it now.
077:47:50|T|LMP|78 hours and ...
077:47:56|T|CDR|Okay. Let's ...
077:48:09|T|LMP|Hey, Jack. Did you data camera back up ...?
077:48:18|T|LMP|Okay. Page 1.
077:48:19|T|CDR|Okay.
077:48:22|T|LMP|Page 2, I'm going to power up the AC.
077:48:56|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; at 77 hours, 49 minutes now into the mission. We presently show Apollo 13 at 1,007 nautical miles [1,865 km] away from the Moon, its velocity slowing down now relative to the Moon. Now reading 6,399 feet per second [1,950 m/s].
077:51:30|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 77 hours, 52 minutes now into the flight. We show five minutes away now from time of the predicted impact of the S-IVB.
077:52:38|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
077:52:43|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
077:52:46|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. We have about three items for you. We have a maneuver PADs, P30 LM maneuver, again; and the maneuver PAD for the CM for splashdown. We also have a checklist change with contingencies, - LM contingencies checklist. And, I'll stand by while you're gathering the books.
077:53:15|T|LMP|Vance, I got the contingency book, so give me that one first.
077:53:20|C|Brand|Okay. Page 18 ...
077:53:26|T|LMP|Okay. I'm at page 18.
077:53:28|C|Brand|Okay. About half-way down. When propellant quantity equals 30 percent, or rather 37 percent, we would like to change that line to read - when time to go is equal to 10 seconds - Of course, the line under that remains the same then, Descent He Reg 1 to Close.
077:53:58|T|LMP|Okay. When time to go equals 10 seconds, Descent Helium Reg 1, Close.
077:54:05|C|Brand|That's affirm. Before I start on the PADs, another comment. The general indications that we gave you before about the Sun being in the commander's window and about stars in the AOT, such as that might be used as general indication for your attitude for the burn, that's all out the window. We are just going on the Sun check that we made earlier and we don't feel that we have information that is good enough to give you the star and the Sun in the window information.
077:54:58|T|CDR|I'll proceed, Joe ... Vance.
077:55:05|C|Brand|Okay. You're very weak now. When you are ready to take the P30 LM maneuver PAD, I'll be reading it up.
077:55:20|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead with the maneuver PAD.
077:55:24|C|Brand|Okay. This is P30, LM maneuver PAD, PC plus 2 hours, starting with Noun 33, 079:27:38.30; plus 0833.0, minus 0050.9, minus 0213.9; N/A, plus 0020.5; 0861.5, 4:24; 272, 081; and the rest is N/A except for comments as follows. Ullage, two jets, 10 seconds; CSM weight, 62480; LM weight, 33452 and the DPS throttle profile is the same as before, 5 seconds at minimum, 21 seconds at 40 percent, and the remainder of the time at Max. Over.
077:57:12|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. PC plus 2 hours, 079:27:38.30; plus 0833.0, minus 0050.9, minus 0213.9; N/A, plus 0020.5; 0861.5, 4:24, 272, 081; and the rest N/A. Ullage, two jets, 10 seconds; CSM weight, 62480; LM weight, 33452. DPS throttle profile same as before, 5 seconds, 40 percent for 21 seconds, 40 percent, and the remainder at Max throttle ...
077:58:30|C|Brand|Okay, Aquarius; Houston. You're coming in about 1 by 1 now. Advise that I heard everything except the beginning Noun 33 values and the comments. Please repeat the readback on those.
077:58:48|T|LMP|Okay. I'm going to Up with the Power Amp here, Vance.
077:59:15|T|LMP|Houston, how do you read Aquarius now?
077:59:17|C|Brand|Hey, you're loud and clear now.
077:59:23|T|LMP|Okay. I got the Power Amps now. PC plus 2 hours, 079:27:38.30; plus 0833.0, minus 0050.9, minus 0213.9; N/A, plus 0020.5; 0861.5, 4:24; 272, 081; rest N/A. Ullage, two jets, 10 seconds; CSM weight, 62480; LM weight, 33452; DPS throttle profile the same, 5 seconds idle, 40 percent at 21 seconds. Remainder at Max.
078:00:13|C|Brand|Roger. Forty percent for 21 seconds, I believe is what you read back. And all the rest is correct. Now, for the maneuver PAD for the CSM. Over.
078:00:29|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by.
078:00:55|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
078:00:58|C|Brand|Okay, Freddo. This is maneuver PAD monitor PC plus 2 hours; all N/A until you get to Noun 61. Latitude, minus 21.65, minus 165.00; 1163.5, 36292; 142:39:22. Over.
078:01:48|T|LMP|Monitor plane change plus 2; Noun 81, minus 21.65, minus 165.00; 1163.5, 36292; 142:39:22.
078:02:06|C|Brand|Roger. That was starting with Noun 61, and that's correct.
078:02:25|C|Brand|By the way, Aquarius, we see the results now from 12's seismometer. Looks like your booster just hit the Moon, and it's rocking it a little bit. Over.
078:02:44|T|CDR|Well, at least something worked on this flight.
078:03:00|C|Brand|And I just want to verify one thing, we could -
078:03:02|T|LMP|Yes, I'm sure -
078:03:03|C|Brand|- Go ahead.
078:03:09|T|LMP|I say, I'm sure glad we didn't have a LM impact, too.
078:03:16|C|Brand|Right. Just wanted to verify - We had poor reception when I was talking to you before - I wanted to verify that you understand that the Sun check you made earlier in the AOT was good, and that's what we're riding on. Anything that we told you in the past about looking at the Sun in the front left window or looking at stars, like Nunki through the AOT, why, we want to forget.
078:03:50|T|CDR|Roger. Understand, Vance. I think Nunki would be kind of hard to see anyway with the Moon right here.
078:03:58|C|Brand|Right.
078:04:00|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 78 hours, 4 minutes. Apollo 13 now 1,704 nautical miles [3,156 km] away from the Moon. Velocity now reading 5,768 feet per second [1,758 m/s]. Vance Brand passed up a new PC plus 2-hour maneuver PAD which reflected a time of ignition of 79 hours, 27 minutes, 38 seconds -
078:04:27|T|CDR|And, Vance, we plan to start powering up at 78:12. Is that a good time or do you think we ought to hold off a little longer?
078:04:46|C|Brand|Jim, we think that's very good.
078:04:52|P|PAO|The Descent Propulsion System burn should produce a posigrade Delta-V of 861 feet per second [262 m/s] with this PAD. Burn duration; 4 minutes, 24 seconds. We're at 78 hours, 5 minutes now into the flight. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
078:04:53|T|CDR|Right.
078:08:23|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houst - Aquarius, Houston.
078:08:31|T|LMP|Go ahead.
078:08:33|C|Brand|Fred, after the burn, we'll get the powerdown instructions, or checklist changes to you. At the same time, we'd like to get a consumables status to you. All I'll say right now is that we think you look in reasonably good shape.
078:08:52|T|LMP|Okay. Very good.
078:09:46|T|CMP|Okay. Houston, Aquarius.
078:09:48|C|Brand|Go ahead.
078:09:52|T|CMP|Okay. One Caution and Warning light here showing that you didn't call out - it's the Pre Amps - I suppose because we don't have the ATCA breaker in yet.
078:10:08|C|Brand|Okay. That's okay.
078:17:38|T|CDR|Houston, are you planning to give us a state vector update?
078:18:04|C|Brand|That's - That's affirm, Jim. All we need is Updata Link circuit breaker closed on panel 11, and P00 and Accept and we can ship it up to you. P00 and Data.
078:18:32|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. We're in Data and P00 and the circuit breaker's in. Go ahead.
078:18:39|C|Brand|Okay. We'll ship her up to you.
078:19:57|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; 78 hours, 20 minutes into the flight of Apollo 13. At present the Apollo 13 spacecraft is 2,461 nautical miles [4,558 m/s] away from the Moon and traveling a speed of 5,343 feet per second [1,629 m/s]. We show one hour and 7 minutes away from time of ignition of the Descent Propulsion System burn.
078:21:45|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
078:21:53|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
078:21:54|C|Brand|Jim, request verify Ranging Function switch is in Ranging. We need that, if it's not there now.
078:22:14|T|LMP|You got it, Vance.
078:22:15|C|Brand|Thank you.
078:22:52|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; at 78 hours, 23 minutes now into the flight. The crew of Apollo 13 continuing to proceed on their activation checklist.
078:23:05|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. The computer is yours.
078:24:15|P|PAO|Flight Dynamics advises Flight Director Gene Kranz that there will be no requirement to update the PC plus 2 hours maneuver PAD.
078:28:15|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Did you call?
078:28:22|T|CDR|We didn't call, Houston.
078:28:25|C|Brand|Okay.
078:29:41|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
078:29:48|T|LMP|Houston, are you calling Aquarius?
078:29:51|C|Brand|Roger, Fred. I would like to confirm that you are getting drinking water out of - potable water out of the Command Module and, if you can make any estimates of how much you use as time goes on, and how much you have used, we would appreciate it for our consumables analysis.
078:30:12|T|LMP|Okay.
078:30:21|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 78 hours, 30 minutes. We now show Apollo 13 at 2,900 -
078:30:26|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. Tried the procedure and out of that pressure, we got 10 drinks made. That's roughly 80 ounces.
078:30:53|P|PAO|We now show Apollo 13 2,958 nautical miles [5,478 km] away ...
078:30:56|C|Brand|Okay, Fred, we had a little static on that one, but I think you said that 80 ounces of water has been used out of the CM. Is that right?
078:31:08|T|LMP|Yes. Jack worked the procedure and filled as many of the drinks as he could, and he made up ten bags of approximately 8 ounces a bag.
078:31:23|C|Brand|Okay. We copy that.
078:31:37|P|PAO|Apollo 13, now traveling at a speed of 5,129 feet per second.
078:36:06|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
078:36:14|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
078:36:16|C|Brand|Jim, just a bit of information, if for any reason you had to slip T<sub>IG</sub>, our people here feel it wouldn't do much harm if you slipped it up to 30 minutes. The procedure, of course as you know, is not to Pro on the flashing 99 and we thought you might like to be aware that T<sub>IG</sub> time isn't all that critical.
078:36:43|T|CDR|Roger. Understand.
078:36:55|P|PAO|That discussion between Vance Brand and Jim Lovell was concerned with the time of ignition for the pericynthion plus 2-hour burn. We're 78 hours, 37 minutes now in the flight of Apollo 13. This is Apollo Control in Houston.
078:37:44|P|PAO|At 78 hours, 38 minutes, we now show Apollo 13 at a distance of 3,268 nautical miles [6,052 km] away from the Moon and at a velocity of 5,030 feet per second [1,533 m/s]. Our countdown clock shows 49 minutes, 30 seconds from time of ignition. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
078:41:07|T|LMP|Okay, Vance; Aquarius.
078:41:10|C|Brand|Go, Fred.
078:41:15|T|LMP|Okay. I think it's finally coming through to us here, what you said just a little while ago. Were you suggesting that we move the T<sub>IG</sub> up 30 minutes?
078:41:25|C|Brand|No, not at all. We're just giving you excess information. Just saying if you had any problem at all it could be slipped.
078:41:38|T|LMP|Oh, okay. Slipped 30 minutes. Okay. That's better.
078:41:42|C|Brand|Right.
078:41:55|C|Brand|You guys are pretty fast, though.
078:42:05|T|LMP|Yes. It kind of surprised us.
078:42:08|C|Brand|I guess that's what happens when you cut a lot out of a checklist.
078:42:14|T|LMP|Yes. Yes, we're taking about a thousand pictures in between steps there, too.
078:45:33|T|LMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius, radio check.
078:45:39|C|Brand|Loud and clear, Fred.
078:45:43|T|LMP|Okay. I had a change in the background noises, wondered if you were still there.
078:45:47|C|Brand|Right.
078:46:21|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 78 hours, 46 minutes now into the flight. We're 41 minutes away from scheduled time of ignition on our pericynthion plus 2-hour burn of the Apollo 13. Apollo 13 now 3,664 nautical miles [6,749 km] out from the Moon. Velocity now reading 4,913 feet per second [1,497 m/s].
078:57:14|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; at 78 hours, 57 minutes into the flight. Flight Director Gene Kranz just advising his team that he will come - go around the room at about minus 10 minutes for a final Go/No-Go for the burn. We now show Apollo 13 at 4,146 nautical miles [7,678 km] away from the Moon and at a velocity of 4,791 feet per second [1,460 m/s].
079:06:25|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston.
079:06:28|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. Go ahead, Houston.
079:06:31|C|Brand|Okay, Aquarius. We have some new information regarding what you shoud see out the commander's window at T<sub>IG</sub>. Over.
079:06:44|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.
079:06:48|C|Brand|According to calculations - calculations, you should see the Moon. It'll be a full Moon. You should see most of the disk and it should be somewhere on your vertical LPD line, probably at about 14 on the LPD scale. Over. Roughly centered on 14.
079:07:38|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I concur. I'm looking at 14 on the LPD and the angle is just about centered. It's due south of Crisium, but it's - The line is just slightly to the north of center.
079:08:08|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. That sounds very good. We see that you have a slight yaw angle, so it should be north of center.
079:08:46|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; seventy -
079:08:48|T|CDR|I can even see Mount Marilyn from here.
079:09:19|P|PAO|The reference that Jim Lovell made there was one of the mountains that he named during his flight on Apollo 8.
079:09:32|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. We're 79 hours, 10 minutes now into the flight, 18 minutes away from time of scheduled ignition on our pericynthion plus 2-hour burn. This will be performed by computer program 40 aboard the Lunar Module, the DPS thrusting program using the primary navigation and guidance system. Lovell and Haise will be in Aquarius at the time of the burn with Jack Swigert in Odyssey. We'll stand by and continue to monitor. We now show Apollo 13 at 4,717 nautical miles [8,736 km] out from the Moon and traveling at a speed of 4,675 feet per second [1,425 m/s]. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
079:13:06|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 79 hours, 13 minutes. Less than 15 minutes away now from time of scheduled ignition. We show 13 at a distance of 4,839 nautical miles [8,962 km] out from the Moon and at a velocity of 4,651 feet per second [1,418 m/s]. Within the next several minutes, Flight Director Gene Kranz is expected to go around the room for Go/No-Go status from each member of his flight control team. We're at 79 hours, 14 minutes into the flight; continuing to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
079:17:33|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 79 hours, 17 minutes. Flight Director Gene Kranz now going around the room for Go/No-Go status from each member of his team. We're Go for the burn. Apollo 13 now 5,039 nautical miles [9,332 km] away from the Moon, traveling at a speed of 4,616 feet per second [1,407 m/s].
079:18:07|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
079:18:13|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
079:18:15|C|Brand|Jim, you are Go for the burn. Go for the burn.
079:18:20|T|CDR|Roger. I understand. Go for the burn.
079:21:08|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. We're a little over 6 minutes now away from time of scheduled ignition. 79 hours, 21 minutes. Meanwhile at Mission Control, both the viewing room and the floor of Mission Operations Control Room have filled up with a considerable number of people. Among those here tonight are Dr. Thomas Paine, Nasa Administrator; Mr. George Low, Deputy Administrator of NASA; Frank Borman, who commanded the flight of Apollo 8 and Gemini 7 and had a flying companion named Jim Lovell; Ken Mattingly is here; Al Shepard, commander of Apollo 14, is on the MOCR floor at this time as is Ed Mitchell, the Lunar Module Pilot, along with Stu Roosa who is scheduled to fly in the Command Module on that flight. We're coming up on 5 minutes until scheduled time of ignition. Gene Kranz has checked with couple of his systems, or members of his flight control team who monitor systems. They indicate they are happy with the data they are looking at now. We're standing by and continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
079:22:57|P|PAO|79 hours, 23 minutes into the flight. We show Apollo 13 at 5,263 nautical miles [9,747 km] relative to the Moon, and traveling at a velocity of 4,578 feet per second [1,395 m/s].
079:23:58|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston, less than 3 minutes away now from scheduled time of ignition as we look at one of our displays in the Mission Control Center, we see that Apollo 13's Lunar Module is now in program 40, that's the Descent Propulsion System thrusting program -
079:24:16|C|Brand|Aquarius, 2 minutes and 40 seconds to go on the mark.
079:24:19|C|Brand|Mark.
079:24:22|C|Brand|Or that was - Stand by.
079:24:24|T|CDR|What was that mark?
079:24:26|C|Brand|Stand by. That was incorrect. Three minutes - Counting down to 3 minutes, and I'll give you a mark, and I'll take into consideration 2 seconds.
079:24:37|C|Brand|Mark.
079:24:41|T|CDR|Roger. We got you.
079:24:53|P|PAO|79 hours, 25 minutes into the flight, Apollo 13 now at a distance of 5,349 nautical miles [9,906 km] away from the Moon. Velocity now reading 4,564 feet per second [1,391 m/s] relative to the Moon.
079:25:44|P|PAO|Less than 2 minutes away now from scheduled time of ignition. Velocity reading 4,560 feet per second [1,390 m/s]; distance from the Moon, 5,383 nautical miles [9,969 km].
079:26:41|P|PAO|One minute away now from scheduled time of ignition.
079:26:43|T|LMP|One minute.
079:26:46|C|Brand|Roger.
079:26:49|P|PAO|Apollo 13 now 5,426 nautical miles [10,049 km] out from the Moon, traveling at a speed of 4,552 feet per second [1,387 m/s].

079:27:28|P|PAO|The engine is armed. Standing by.
079:27:49|P|PAO|Ground confirms ignition.
079:27:51|T|CDR|We're burning, 40 percent.
079:27:54|C|Brand|Houston copies.
079:28:09|P|PAO|Attitude looks good at this point.
079:28:09|T|CDR|One hundred percent.
079:28:11|C|Brand|Roger.
079:28:31|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. You're looking good.
079:28:36|T|CDR|Roger.
079:28:40|P|PAO|1 minute now into the burn.
079:29:40|P|PAO|DPS is looking good, 2 minutes into the burn.
079:29:52|C|Brand|Aquarius, you were looking good at 2 minutes. Still looking good.
079:29:58|T|CDR|Two minutes. Roger.
079:30:04|P|PAO|Velocity building up. Our DSKY shows we've gained 451 feet per second at this time.
079:30:31|P|PAO|Reports to Flight Director Gene Kranz indicate all systems are looking good. Coming up on 3 minutes into the burn.
079:30:43|C|Brand|Aquarius, you're Go at 3 minutes.
079:30:49|T|CDR|Aquarius. Roger.
079:31:13|P|PAO|The onboard display shows less than a minute to go on the burn now.
079:31:38|P|PAO|Coming up on 4 minutes into the burn.
079:31:46|C|Brand|Don't forget Descent Reg 1, off; 10 seconds to go.
079:32:05|T|CDR|Shutdown.
079:32:07|C|Brand|Roger. Shutdown.
079:32:10|P|PAO|That was Commander Jim Lovell reporting shutdown, the engine is off. We're at 79 hours, 32 minutes into the flight.
079:32:31|T|CDR|Are you reading our 16 40, Houston?
079:32:36|C|Brand|Roger. We're reading it.
079:32:41|T|CDR|We'll proceed. Here's our residuals.
079:32:52|C|Brand|Roger. Very small.
079:33:04|P|PAO|Apollo Control; 79 hours, 33 minutes, 5,707 nautical miles [10,569 km] out from the Moon at this time.
079:33:07|C|Brand|Good burn, Aquarius.
079:33:12|T|CDR|Go ahead.
079:33:13|C|Brand|I say, that was a good burn.
079:33:18|T|CDR|Roger. And now we want to power down as soon as possible.
079:33:23|C|Brand|Roger. Understand.
079:33:54|P|PAO|We're at 79 hours -
079:33:56|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
079:33:58|C|Brand|Go ahead.
079:34:02|T|CDR|Suggest maybe you just read off the circuit breakers you want us to power down. As you did yesterday, for us.
079:34:09|C|Brand|Okay. We have a procedure ready to send up to you here in about 2 minutes. Let us know when you're all ready to take it.
079:34:18|T|CDR|Okay.
079:34:23|T|LMP|Okay. Is it going to be better to write this on a blank page, Vance, or can we use some portion of the powerdown list there in the contingency book that already exists.
079:34:33|C|Brand|Stand by 1.
079:36:03|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
079:36:07|T|CDR|Go ahead.
079:36:08|C|Brand|Slight delay here, Jim. It will be a couple of minutes before we read that up to you, and we're looking at the contingency checklist powerdown and that's on page 5. You might be getting that out while we get all ready to give it to you.
079:36:58|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 79 hours, 37 minutes into the flight -
079:37:03|T|LMP|Vance, could you give us that page number again. Page 5 doesn't make sense.
079:37:14|C|Brand|Okay. Make that power 5 in the contingency checklist, Fred. And it's the -
079:37:24|T|LMP|- that's better.
079:37:25|C|Brand|- middle part of the page, it starts emergency powerdown, and we'll mark that up.
079:37:34|P|PAO|We're at 79 hours, 37 minutes into the flight. Guidance has reported that the burn duration was literally right on the money.
079:37:42|T|LMP|Okay. I'm to 5, Emergency powerdown.
079:37:48|C|Brand|Okay. But hold off on it because we might have to start PTC up again here. And that's the point that's being resolved right at the moment, so stand by.
079:38:02|T|LMP|Okay.
079:38:17|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston. The term PTC, Passive Thermal Control is a bar-b-que mode which has been used on previous flights. There's a discussion in the control center as to whether or not we should continue it in that mode during the coast phase in. We're 79 hours, 39 minutes into the flight and continuing to monitor; this is Apollo Control, Houston.
079:38:45|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 79 hours, 40 minutes into the mission. We show Apollo 13 at 6,003 nautical miles [11,118 km] out from the Moon. At this time, traveling at a speed of 4,980 feet per second [1,518 m/s].
079:42:19|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
079:42:25|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
079:42:26|C|Brand|Okay. We're ready to give you the procedure which will power you down a good bit, and after the PTC is going, maybe we can give you further information. Are you ready to copy? Starting at the middle of the page, power 5.
079:42:48|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead, Vance.
079:42:51|C|Brand|Okay. After number 1, first line, cross out &quot;And VHF-A.&quot; Second line, cross out &quot;Simplex operation.&quot; Third line, cross out &quot;Prime.&quot; That refers to Prime Power Amp, Off. That - that &quot;Prime&quot; should actually be replaced by Off. And that's the second prime that line. Also in the third line the last word &quot;Off&quot; should be crossed out and replaced by &quot;PCM.&quot; Fourth line is okay. Fifth line, which is &quot;VHF Voice, On, Off, Off,&quot; cross out. &quot;Lighting, Floods,&quot; which is the next line should be &quot;Off&quot;, but add the following, &quot;Or Overhead/Forward prefer Off.&quot; Okay. Step 2 remains the same; no change for the moment. Stand by. Skip step 2. Do not do it. Just go on to step 3, which is &quot;Configure circuit breakers per the chart.&quot; That takes us to page power 6. Why don't you give me a readback on what you had on power 5, Freddo.
079:44:48|T|LMP|Okay. On power 5, emergency powerdown. Item 1, first line, I scratch the &quot;And VHF-A.&quot; Second line &quot;Simplex operation.&quot; Third line, I replace the second &quot;Prime&quot; which is the Power Amp with an &quot;Off,&quot; and the last word in that line is &quot;Off,&quot; replaced it with &quot;PCM.&quot; Fourth line is okay. Fifth line, I scratch the whole line. Lighting, we haven't needed floods yet so we will just leave them off, exterior lighting off. Scratch line 2 and I am now on power 6, wait for your update on the CB panels.
079:45:31|C|Brand|Okay. Power 6. Okay. Power 6 refers to panel 11. You should go per the chart with the exception of those breakers that I call out. First line is okay. Or, let's say, first row. Second row, Quad 4, TCA, closed; Quad 3, TCA, closed; Quad 2, TCA, closed; and Quad 1, TCA, closed. The rest of that row is okay. Row 3, about halfway over, ATCA (PGNS), closed. Okay. The rest of that line is okay. Fourth line, Heater - stand by. Okay. That line is all okay with the exception of the last three circuit breakers, Fred, under PGNS, which is LGC DSKY, IMU Standby, IMU Operate. Those three should be closed, at least for the time being. And finally, the fifth line; it's okay as is. And would you give me a readback on that?
079:47:35|T|LMP|Okay. I disagree on the fifth line. It appears that we ought to have the Ascent ECA Control, Open.
079:47:49|C|Brand|Okay. We'll check into that one and while we are listening to the rest of your readout.
079:47:57|T|LMP|Okay. And top row is correct as is. Second row we want the Quad TCAs 1 through 4 closed. On the third row, we want the ATCA (PGNS), closed. On the fourth row we want the PGNS LGC DSKY, IMU Standby, IMU Operate, all closed, and you're saying the bottom row as is.
079:48:23|C|Brand|Okay. We'll go along with what you said on the Ascent ECA Control. That should be open.
079:48:38|T|CDR|Okay. Continue, Vance.
079:48:41|C|Brand|Okay. Next page, power 7, panel 16. First row, close the four Quad TCA circuit breakers, that is, Quad 1, TCA; Quad 2, Quad 3, and Quad 4 TCA. Okay. Rows 2, 3, and 4 are okay.
079:49:17|T|LMP|Okay. Panel 16, top row, we want to close Quad 1 through 4 TCA breakers, and you're saying the other three rows are as is. Again, I have the exception; the Ascent ECA Control on 16 should also be Open.
079:49:35|C|Brand|Okay. We concur on that, and we have a late arrival in row 3. Stand by.
079:49:52|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. One addition, third row. The S-Band Power Amp. Request that you pull that circuit breaker and leave the switch in Primary.
079:50:10|T|LMP|Okay. Yes, that's the way we were doing it before. I'll pull the Power Amp CB, and then I'll go back to the first page and put the Power Amp to Prime.
079:50:22|C|Brand|That's correct; that should be changed back to Prime. And that's - That's it.
079:50:41|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 79 hours -
079:50:42|T|CDR|Good work, Vance.
079:50:46|C|Brand|Thank you.
079:50:48|P|PAO|- 51 minutes into the flight. That was Vance Brand going through a checklist with the Apollo 13 crew for procedures in powering down the systems.
079:51:00|T|LMP|Reset, Off and Low. Okay. Lighting bus, Off; Exterior Lighting is Off. Okay. You want to get your breakers, Jim?
079:51:14|P|PAO|We now show 13 at 6,515 nautical miles [12,066 km] out.
079:51:16|T|LMP|We ought to probably go back to that wide deadband.
079:51:24|T|CDR|Okay. The Bus Tie Inverters are coming off the line.
079:51:28|T|LMP|Yes. Go ahead. Sorry, I put the switch off. That'll kill caution and warning.
079:52:02|T|CDR|Okay. Let's see. So we're going to lose the ball again.
079:52:06|T|LMP|Yes.
079:52:11|T|LMP|I'll get 16 Noun 20 up.
079:52:53|T|CDR|Do you have me move Auto Transfer this time?
079:53:07|T|CDR|Why do I still have a VHF-A receiver off?
079:53:13|T|LMP|You don't, do you?
079:53:15|T|CDR|Yeah.
079:53:16|T|CDR|Why don't you give them a call, panel 11.
079:53:19|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. I'm on - Do you read me now, hot mike?
079:53:23|C|Brand|Roger. Loud and clear, Fred.
079:53:26|T|LMP|Okay. Jim just noticed we got a VHF breaker in on panel 11 still, I think, that probably should be opened.
079:53:41|C|Brand|Okay. That's affirmative. Pull the VHF-A receiver.
079:53:54|T|LMP|Okay. Pull it, Jim.
079:53:55|T|CDR|I got it already. Okay. Now, why are we putting the cabin fan on?
079:54:06|T|CDR|Oh, oh, oh. Oh, yes. Okay.
079:54:23|T|CDR|Okay. I'm going to pull inverter 1.
079:54:24|T|LMP|Okay. Not very long since they had the switch off on you, anyway.
079:54:31|T|CDR|Okay.
079:54:32|T|LMP|Roger -
079:54:33|T|CDR|- but my only question is, I got the Cross Tie Bus circuit breaker in? Could be - Yes, this one right here.
079:54:50|T|LMP|It's alright, because that line is open.
079:55:21|T|LMP|I'll look over at that caution in a minute.
079:55:53|T|LMP|Vance, Aquarius.
079:55:56|C|Brand|Roger. Go ahead, Fred.
079:56:01|T|LMP|Yes. We've managed the first 30 hours or so here without the caution and warning; we don't need to keep it up now, do we?
079:56:27|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. That's one that we're leaving up until the PTC is established. We have a procedure for PTC to try with you, which we're hopeful will work pretty well. And I'll read that up as soon as you get what you're doing now done.
079:56:43|T|LMP|Okay.
079:56:44|T|CDR|Why don't you go ahead, and I'll get this PTC procedure. It's by the photo log, and I'll just get that.
079:57:05|T|LMP|And one other question, Houston. You really want to pull the ASA breaker? You want to give up the AGS probably for good now, huh?
079:57:33|T|CDR|Houston, I'm standing by to copy the PTC procedures
079:57:39|C|Brand|Okay. I'll get back with you on your question in a minute, Fred. Now, here comes the PTC procedure. Step 1, Guidance Control to PGNS; 2, Mode Control, Att Hold; Verb 76, Enter; maneuver to PTC attitude; and that incidentally is roll 0, pitch 90, and present yaw. We realize you can't monitor that on your FDAI, but you can on a verb, with a Verb 16, Noun 20.
079:58:35|C|Brand|With me?
079:58:40|T|CDR|Roger. Guidance Control, PGNS; Mode Control, Att Hold, Verb 76, Enter; maneuver to PTC attitude which is roll 0, pitch 90, and yaw, which is the present yaw. Is that correct?
079:58:54|C|Brand|That's correct. Okay. Next. Mode - at - When you're established at the attitude, Mode Control, Auto. Key in Verb 16, Noun 20 to monitor rates; when less than 0.1 degree a second, rate in all - in each axis, then disable plus-X thrusters. Okay. Next, Verb 25, Noun 07, Enter; 1257, Enter; 252, Enter; 1, Enter; Verb 77, Enter; Verb 48, Enter; put in the DAP, 22110 and Proceed; Verb 34, Enter; then Verb 16, Noun 20; and monitor rates. On rates less than 0.01 degrees per second in all axis: Verb 76, Enter; Mode Control, Att Hold; then 30 clicks of right yaw to start the maneuver. Over.
080:01:48|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. PTC procedure: Guidance Control, PGNS; Mode Control, Att Hold; Verb 76, Enter; maneuver to PTC attitude; roll 0, pitch 90, yaw 0; my ball now, of course, is inoperative, so I'll have to get that on the DSKY. The 5 is Mode Control, Auto; 6: Verb 16, Noun 20, monitor rates; rates less than 1 degree per second in each axis, disable, and I didn't hear that last part. The next one was Verb 25, Noun 07, Enter; 1257, Enter; 252, Enter; 1, Enter; Verb 77, Enter; Verb 48, Enter; 22110, Proceed; Verb 34, Enter; Verb 16, Noun 20, Enter; monitor rates. Rates less than 0.01 degrees per second in all axis. Verb 76, Enter; Mode Control, Att Hold; then 30 clicks of right yaw to stop - to start - maneuvers.
080:03:04|C|Brand|Roger. That's correct, Jim. To - to answer your questions and correct one point, yaw should be your present yaw, whatever it is, and that's up with roll 0, pitch 90, present yaw. The other thing is, you said disable and you didn't hear the rest. That's disable plus-X thrusters. And finally, near the end, the 22110 refers to DAP loading.
080:03:48|T|CDR|Roger. Now, to maneuver to PTC roll 0, pitch 90 and yaw is - and pitch is here, roll is here. Yaw - whatever yaw we have in. Okay, Vance. In our initial maneuver to PTC attitude, I am going to have to use - to display 16 20 and I'll have to use the TTCA to get there.
080:05:01|C|Brand|Jim, Roger. Your use of the TC - TTCA and just a reminder that in maneuvering that - that - that roll is in R3 and yaw is in R1.
080:05:17|T|CDR|That's affirm. And I'm going to take out roll first to get it zero and then I'm going to take care of pitch.
080:05:24|C|Brand|Okay.
080:06:07|T|CDR|Okay. Guidance Control, PGNS; Mode Control to Att Hold. Verb 76 Enter. Okay. We've got to get that out. ... it stopped moving.
080:06:54|T|CDR|Here we go.
080:07:32|T|CDR|... the battery. ...
080:08:27|T|CDR|Do you know what the plus-X thrusters are?
080:08:41|T|CDR|Yes, okay. I just wanted to make sure you knew. I got them over here.
080:08:55|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
080:08:59|T|CDR|Go ahead.
080:09:01|C|Brand|Okay. A couple of things, Jim. One is that you can use the TTCAs to maneuver, but you're going to save a lot of fuel if you'd try Minimum Impulse. So, that might be a better recommendation. The other thing is, we'd like to give you a Go before you disable the plus S - X thrusters, and before you do a Verb 76, and Mode Control to Att Hold. Over.
080:09:40|T|CDR|Okay; understand. You want a Go before I - I'm - Of course, I just did a 76, and the Mode Control is in Att Hold, at this time. But, this is later on down.
080:10:04|C|Brand|Yes. All we wanted to do was take a look at things before you disabled the plus-X thrusters, and before you go to Min Impulse at the end there - that Verb 76, Enter; Mode Control, Att Hold.
080:10:20|T|CDR|Roger. Understand. And I'm maneuvering my roll now to zero.
080:10:25|C|Brand|Roger.
080:10:51|T|CDR|Yes. Those are the plus-X, right?
080:11:03|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius
080:11:07|C|Brand|Go ahead, Aquarius.
080:11:11|T|LMP|Ah -
080:11:12|C|Brand|Go ahead.
080:11:13|T|LMP|In what fashion did you want us to disable those plus-X thrusters? Just pulling those appropriate TCA breakers, or did you want to actually go in and mask those jets?
080:11:33|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. We didn't explain that. The Verb 25, Noun 07, Enter sequence does that.
080:11:43|T|LMP|Okay. I didn't read the whole procedure. Jim just mentioned he wanted to disable plus-X.
080:11:49|T|CDR|I just did.
080:11:50|T|LMP|Okay.
080:12:32|T|LMP|And, Vance, are you still trying to get me an answer on that - pulling that ASA breaker?
080:12:44|C|Brand|That's affirm, Fred. This - The word here is, pull it.
080:12:53|T|LMP|Okay. Sure didn't get much work out of the AGS this time.
080:14:43|T|LMP|It's going slightly.
080:14:45|T|CDR|So is this one.
080:15:26|T|LMP|Yes. You got a ways to go in pitch.
080:15:29|T|CDR|Yes.
080:15:30|T|LMP|Around 80.
080:16:46|T|CDR|You want to rest a little bit?
080:16:52|T|LMP|What time is it, 9:30? I got an about what? I think I got about 10.
080:18:49|T|CDR|We're now in the hands of tracking.
080:18:52|T|LMP|Yes. It looks different than before.
080:19:09|T|LMP|Hard to do P37 in the LM. Hard to do a P37 in the LM.
080:19:52|T|CDR|Well, you can see where we almost were going to land -
080:19:57|T|CDR|- See Ptolemaeus, Alphonsus - There's Herschel.
080:20:13|T|LMP|Yes, you can barely see it in the corner there.
080:20:18|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
080:20:23|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
080:20:25|C|Brand|Okay. Just some info. We're working up a procedure for you to use - to - to use Command Module LiOH canisters to connect to your hoses - the outlet hoses in the LM so that, as time passes in the mission, you can continue scrubbing the LM atmosphere. And this whole thing requires modifying a kit so that you can attach the hose modifying a LiOH canister, so you can attach the hose to it. So, sometime in the future, we will be coming up to you with that procedure. Second point - Second point is, we're standing by to watch your maneuver for the PTC procedure. Over.
080:21:16|T|CDR|Okay. I'm in process now, Vance, of maneuvering to zero yaw, 90-degree pitch, using Minimum Impulse.
080:21:25|C|Brand|Okay.
080:21:42|T|LMP|And, Vance, I assume it had also been brought up that we got two extra secondary cartridges - one in each PLSS.
080:21:55|C|Brand|Roger.
080:22:07|T|CDR|We ought to start working on that mod right now.
080:22:13|C|Brand|Yes. We wish we could send you a kit and it would be kind of like putting a model airplane together or something. As it turns out, this contraption will look like a mailbox, when you get it all put together.
080:22:28|T|LMP|What do we make it out of, Vance?
080:22:32|C|Brand|One canister with a -
080:22:35|T|LMP|- How about planning a rendezvous procedure?
080:22:38|C|Brand|- with a plastic roof.
080:22:50|T|CDR|Just for information, Houston, during - Just prior to going around the Moon, we saw a lot of debris that was floating by us, including some - one rather large piece looked like the wrapping off of a line of some sort that is - still is was with us.
080:23:10|C|Brand|Roger. Copy, Jim.
080:23:16|T|CDR|Even after our free-return midcourse yesterday.
080:23:24|C|Brand|Okay. We copy that.
080:23:40|T|CDR|No matter what I do, I can't stop that. Roll either way won't do it.
080:23:49|T|CDR|Yes.
080:24:06|T|LMP|Well, I don't see any way around it, Jim. It sure doesn't seem to be doing much, does it? It won't go down.
080:24:29|T|CDR|I don't know. I wonder if they tried that in the simulator. I can't seem to get roll to go up. It goes down on me, no matter how I hit the controllers.
080:24:45|T|CDR|Got pitch zero.
080:24:56|T|CDR|You can really see a change in rate?
080:24:59|T|LMP|Try slewing yaw, see if it'll couple in roll.
080:25:15|T|CDR|No?
080:25:26|T|CDR|There we go.
080:25:45|T|CDR|That does it.
080:25:54|T|LMP|...
080:26:00|T|CDR|I don't know what caused it.
080:27:25|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 80 hours, 27 minutes. Apollo 13 now 8,137 nautical miles [15,070 km] out from the Moon. And presently traveling at a speed of -
080:27:36|T|CDR|Here we still have 67-percent fuel level. I wonder how come they didn't ... Delta-V curve?
080:27:56|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
080:27:59|T|CDR|Go ahead.
080:28:01|C|Brand|Jim, we don't have any data on your movements right now. How does it look like this procedure's going to work out so far as getting an attitude set up, the first part of the procedure?
080:28:19|T|CDR|Well, Vance, I've been trying to use Minimum Impulse only attitude control to get my roll and yaw - the roll and pitch, rather. But, with the attitude control only in this configuration, I - I can't command these - the roll the way I want to. So, I had to go to TTCA to get my roll to build up towards zero, it was going - decreasing towards 270. I really don't know what the combination is in the attitude control, that you can get the control to pitch and roll the way you want it to. You've got to use the TTCA.
080:29:00|C|Brand|Roger. Copy.
080:29:04|T|CDR|I now have both pitch and yaw - or pitch and roll going toward the designated amounts, now passing through 23 degrees in pitch, and I'm going up past 321 degrees in roll. And I am letting go that direction and when I get near, 90 in pitch and zero in roll, I'll go to Auto and damp the rates.
080:30:00|T|CDR|Get a little sleep? That's okay.
080:30:28|T|CDR|We've got to rig up a method of using those lithium hydroxide canisters.
080:30:53|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. We just got a Master Alarm and an ECS light. I take it the partial pressure CO<sub>2</sub> is - yeah - that's what tripped it.
080:31:15|T|LMP|Get rid of that mother.
080:31:19|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Say again.
080:31:20|T|CDR|Oh what was that? CO<sub>2</sub>? All right. CO<sub>2</sub> value is getting high. We had a ... ECS light and a blinking component light.
080:31:37|C|Brand|Okay. Copy.
080:32:14|C|Brand|Stand by on that PPCO<sub>2</sub>.
080:32:20|T|CDR|Say again, Houston.
080:32:41|T|CDR|Hello, Houston. How do you read? Over.
080:32:43|C|Brand|Okay. Read you loud and clear now, Jim.
080:32:48|T|CDR|Okay. Did you hear what I just said about the ECS light and the blinking CO<sub>2</sub> component light?
080:32:54|C|Brand|Okay. We got that and - Stand by 1.
080:33:01|T|CDR|Okay.
080:33:17|T|LMP|Not much.
080:33:34|T|CDR|Jack, we might have to have you rig up this CO<sub>2</sub> rig they're talking about.
080:33:42|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
080:33:42|T|CDR|Go ahead. Houston. Over.
080:33:43|T|LMP|Oh! We've got a long ways to go.
080:33:47|T|CDR|Go ahead.
080:33:49|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. We're going to have to get back with you in a couple of minutes on whether or not we switch over at this time to your other canister. Second point, it might help in setting up this PTC if you concentrate on roll first, and get that going; and then work on pitch, when roll is established, and sort of take whatever yaw you get
080:34:21|T|CDR|Okay. Vance, I tried that but when I start doing roll only I get pitch coupled in with it. But both of them rolling up toward this desired amount, though. I'm up to 46 and in pitch and 326 in roll.
080:34:42|C|Brand|Okay. Understand you've tried it.
080:34:55|T|CDR|Once I get roll zeroed, I don't think it'll be too bad.
080:35:53|T|LMP|(Laughter)
080:36:01|T|CDR|So what did they put on my LEVA?
080:36:15|T|LMP|Oh, boy.
080:36:23|T|CMP|...?
080:36:25|T|LMP|No. He didn't want it. There she goes, gang. The Moon.
080:36:40|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
080:36:45|T|CDR|Go ahead, Vance.
080:36:46|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. Since the first recommendation on how to maneuver PTC didn't work out, we have another one. And you might try this. Put yaw at zero, then start the roll, and the pitch after that.
080:37:27|T|LMP|Vance, do you read?
080:37:29|C|Brand|Yes. I do now. Go ahead.
080:37:33|T|LMP|Okay. You guys just tell me what sort of material you had in mind to build this mailbox out of, and Jack and I will go to work on trying to construct that thing. Assume we'll use the space-age baling wire or the gray tape?
080:37:51|C|Brand|That's affirm. We have a lengthy procedure here; but, in short, you use plastic as a covering for the whole thing. You put some kind of a stiffener at the top so the plastic doesn't suck against the LOI - LiOH enter - entrance side. You'll - You need gray tape to stick the whole thing together, and you need something like a sock to put in the - the bottom so that the outlet side is plugged up. As it turns out, the flow is rather U-shaped through the cartridge, Fred. It, if you plug up the bottom, it comes in one side of the top and goes out the other.
080:38:45|T|LMP|Okay. (Sigh) Hold on a minute. Let - Let us go get a cartridge and with it in hand, I'll speak to you some more.
080:39:01|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
080:39:03|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. Go ahead.
080:39:06|C|Brand|Okay. Really, I think we should give you a more detailed procedure on that; and, in general, those are the materials that are to be used, but let us get back with a detailed procedure on how to make this cartridge arrangement work.
080:39:27|T|LMP|Okay.
080:39:38|T|CDR|And to answer your question about PTC, Vance, it's rather difficult to use yaw in zero right away. So what I'm doing, yaw is working toward zero, right now. Pitch is working toward 90, and roll is working toward - zero. So, we - We're just going to take some time to get there, that's all.
080:40:08|C|Brand|Roger. Quite a bit of noise now. I understand you're still having a problem getting there with the PTC.
080:40:19|T|CDR|We are getting there slowly.
080:40:21|C|Brand|Okay.
080:40:42|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Let's try Forward Omni.
080:41:38|T|CDR|I don't know, it doesn't ...
080:41:47|T|CDR|I don't know, it looks that way.
080:42:41|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. How do you read, now?
080:42:56|T|LMP|Houston, how do you read?
080:42:57|C|Brand|Loud and clear, now. Go ahead.
080:43:02|T|LMP|Okay. I switched to Forward Omni, now.
080:43:05|C|Brand|Roger. That's better.
080:43:07|T|LMP|Okay.
080:43:53|T|CDR|I can't stop. I can't stop pitch.
080:43:57|T|LMP|...
080:44:00|T|CDR|That would only use fuel.
080:44:06|T|CDR|Yes ... and stick it around that way.
080:44:30|T|CDR|It's not the wrong thing, though.
080:45:52|T|LMP|Oh, yes. That was pretty.
080:46:53|T|LMP|That didn't sound very good.
080:47:05|T|LMP|Yes, hang on to that.
080:49:01|T|CDR|Everything.
080:49:18|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 80 hours, 49 minutes now into the flight. We show Apollo 13 at 9,118 nautical miles [16,887 km] away from the Moon -
080:49:31|T|CDR|They're a hell of a long ways away.
080:49:33|T|LMP|Right.
080:49:33|P|PAO|- and traveling at a speed of 4,718 feet per second [1,438 m/s].
080:49:38|T|CDR|Yes, we're not moving that fast to Earth.
080:49:40|T|LMP|Not yet.
080:49:45|P|PAO|Our revised Flight Plan shows a rest period of 6 hours for both spacecraft Commander Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert -
080:49:59|T|LMP|Hey, we're already in the ... 
080:50:02|P|PAO|- Command Module Pilot, starting at 81 hours, 30 minutes.
080:50:02|T|CMP|Yes.
080:50:05|T|LMP|Dark ... to the trajectory.
080:50:08|T|CDR|Huh?
080:50:09|T|LMP|Yes.
080:50:10|T|CDR|Yes, I've been trying to get roll out. Roll to zero. Just rolling in to zero, I'm going to put it in Att Hold. Then it'll take out yaw, leaving pitch the way it is; then we're going to pitch down.
080:50:33|P|PAO|Of course the start of the sleep period is dependent on setting up attitude for PTC. We're at 80 hours, 51 minutes now into the flight; and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
080:50:48|T|CDR|We've got to think about when we have to start changing that canister.
080:50:55|T|LMP|Fifteen even.
080:50:57|T|CDR|Huh?
080:50:58|T|LMP|... to 15.
080:51:00|T|CDR|What is it right now?
080:51:02|T|LMP|Nothing. We're not reading anything.
080:51:07|T|CDR|Well, that's the one they wanted you to leave in.
080:51:10|T|LMP|...
080:51:14|T|CDR|It's in. That's how it triggers the - Okay, Jack. I'm going to push in on this thing to stop it.
080:51:35|T|CDR|Yes.
080:51:51|T|LMP|That just turned the Master Alarm back on. Now that it's on steady, I'll leave it on. I can't understand why I got a power - Oh, I know. That's right -. That reading is correct.
080:53:03|T|CDR|Yaw. I'm going the wrong way though, aren't I?
080:54:32|T|LMP|(Laughter).
080:54:54|T|LMP|Okay. What we're going to do, Jack, ... over there ...
080:55:19|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
080:55:25|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
080:55:26|C|Brand|Jim, it looks pretty good except that the pitch is going out in the wrong direction, now. Over.
080:55:37|T|CDR|I concur. What I'm going to do is get roll to zero and I'm trying to bring yaw into zero and as soon as I get those two pretty well matched up, then I'm going to take the pitch and try to pitch it down.
080:55:49|C|Brand|Okeydoke.
080:56:02|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; 80 hours, 56 minutes. Apollo 13 now 9,420 nautical miles [17,446 km] out from the Moon, velocity reading 4,701 feet per second [1,433 m/s]. Our real time Flight Plan has just updated the start of the rest period for Commander Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert. That time now reading 82 hours Ground Elapsed Time. Jim Lovell still working with establishing the proper attitudes for Passive Thermal Control. Apparently roll is pretty well nulled out, still moving out a bit in the pitch axis. We're at 80 hours, 57 minutes into the flight; and this Apollo Control, Houston.
080:57:33|T|CDR|Okay. Now I've got pitch going down; I've got roll almost zero and yaw is almost zero.
080:57:42|C|Brand|Okay. Copy, there, Jim.
081:01:26|T|CDR|Houston, what's an acceptable pitch attitude, that you'll take?
081:01:56|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
081:02:12|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
081:02:17|T|CDR|Roger. What's the acceptable pitch attitude that we can have for PTC? I can go into Auto any time now, I'm looking at 118 degrees in pitch, practically zero roll, and about 40 degrees of yaw.
081:02:31|C|Brand|Ninety degrees pitch.
081:02:37|T|CDR|I'm looking at 118 degrees of pitch.
081:02:48|C|Brand|Stand by.
081:03:06|T|CDR|I'm trying to talk to them.
081:03:09|C|Brand|Stand by a minute, Jim. The pitch is the important thing, but - but stand by 1.
081:03:19|T|CDR|Okay. It's coming down. What's that? Well, I guess I'd better eat something. Hey, this one has some of that candied jelly things, we've gone a hell of a long time without any sleep. I said we've gone a hell of a long time without any sleep.
081:03:47|T|CDR|We'll have to start thinking about getting the ... back to sleep again because - I know - I - I didn't get hardly any sleep last night at all.
081:07:16|T|CDR|Hey, Fred? These jettison bags with the - are real airtight stuff, if you want to use them for wrapping for a lithium hydroxide bag or something like that.
081:07:33|T|CDR|Yes, this stuff is really tight.
081:07:46|T|CDR|Yes.
081:10:12|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
081:10:16|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
081:10:17|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. Would you stable your - stabilize your rates here at the attitudes you're at now and go Att Hold. Over.
081:10:29|T|CDR|Okay. Will do. I'm now at 103 degrees - 106 degrees pitch, and 2.5 degrees roll.
081:10:36|C|Brand|Roger.
081:11:04|T|LMP|...?
081:11:06|T|CDR|No.
081:12:16|T|CDR|Are they mine are ... Hey, I got you a clean one.
081:12:22|T|LMP|Okay.
081:12:23|T|CDR|Well that's in the trash bag. Oh, I thought - if you wanted a jettison bag, you'll have to use the lithium hydroxide ...
081:13:18|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Are you monitoring my angles? It appears that it might be less then 1 degree per second.
081:13:30|C|Brand|Stand by. We'll check them, Jim.
081:14:29|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
081:14:34|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
081:14:36|C|Brand|Jim, that's affirm. We're monitoring and you're almost there, but we'd like to let them stabilize a little bit longer. Over.
081:14:48|T|CDR|Okay. We'll - We'll just hold.
081:14:51|C|Brand|And if - if you can now go into your eat period or do something else while the rates are stabilizing, why, we recommend you relax somewhere and get some chow.
081:15:07|T|CDR|Right-o. We'll do that.
081:18:03|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
081:18:08|T|CDR|Go ahead.
081:18:10|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. Looks like your rates are damped sufficient. Recommend that you go ahead with the 'Verb 25, Noun 07, Enter' bit, on down through the 'Verb 34, Enter', and then wish you'd stand by for us to look at it again before you go beyond that. Over.
081:18:36|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'll go through Verb 25, Noun 07, down through Verb 34, Enter, and I'll stand by.
081:18:47|C|Brand|Right-o.
081:18:51|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston; at 81 hours and 19 minutes now into the flight. We presently show Apollo 13 at 10,431 nautical miles [19,318 km] out from the Moon. It's velocity reading 4,649 feet per second [1,417 m/s]. A couple of points of clarification: the master alarm on the CO<sub>2</sub> canister was expected to occur at some point in the mission. It is normally set at 7.6 millimeters of CO<sub>2</sub>. This number chosen as an alert to watch the canisters. However, the medical officials had agreed -
081:19:46|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. That's complete.
081:19:49|P|PAO|- Medical officials had agreed that it would be desirable to raise this number on our return to 15 millimeters in order to preserve the lifetime on the canisters.
081:19:55|C|Brand|Roger. Houston copies, and we'll -
081:19:58|T|CDR|You want to monitor our rates?
081:19:59|C|Brand|Roger.
081:20:02|P|PAO|Here at MSC, the level in laboratory testing has -
081:20:08|C|Brand|We -
081:20:09|T|CDR|You want to monitor the rates; we're 16 20.
081:20:12|C|Brand|Roger. That's the way it should be done, and we're standing by for the rates to damp out some more.
081:20:16|P|PAO|Here in the MSC laboratories, the levels, using test subjects, have been as high as 22 millimeters of CO<sub>2</sub> with no ill effects.
081:20:21|T|CDR|Okay.
081:20:33|P|PAO|On our Passive Thermal Control, we have damped the rates at this point. There has been an effort on the part of the crew and the ground to perform this activity with minimum use of the RCS propellants. We're at 81 hours, 21 minutes.
081:20:51|T|CDR|How you coming?
081:20:56|T|CDR|Oh, we're taking stock of how much we got there, maybe sort of think about rationing some of it. I mean just to make sure we've got enough to last us and that we get enough water out. I'd hate to run out of water on the last day. Take a look and see how much we got, and fill them up and just hold them there. Yes, and I'll tell you the stuff that's good to eat now will be the candies, the sandwich spreads. Maybe the freeze - the dehydrated stuff. If you have to rehydrate it, it'd be kind of difficult. No, wet packs are good.
081:22:24|T|CDR|As a matter of fact, we might use those little - Well, how about the PLSSs?
081:22:34|T|CDR|Yes, I know, but I mean the PLSSs are bombs, too.
081:22:39|T|CMP|...
081:22:41|T|CDR|We're damping rates.
081:22:44|T|CMP|...
081:22:47|T|CDR|Well, maybe we ought to use the OPS first.
081:25:57|T|CDR|You guys moving around?
081:26:07|T|CDR|Okay.
081:26:40|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; 81 hours, 27 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Apollo 13 now 10,776 nautical miles [19,957 km] away from the Moon headed towards the Earth, and traveling at a speed of 4,633 feet per second [1,412 m/s]. To repeat our earlier comments, the master alarm on the CO<sub>2</sub> canister was expected to occur at some point in the flight - the return flight. It is normally set for a level of 7.6 mm of CO<sub>2</sub> to trigger the alarm.
081:27:25|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
081:27:30|T|CDR|Go ahead, Vance.
081:27:32|C|Brand|Jim, just a reminder. Any waste water dumped at this point would really jiggle up the PTC preparation, so request you save that until we're spun up. Over.
081:27:49|T|CDR|Right. I don't think we're doing any.
081:27:52|C|Brand|No. No, I don't, think so, but I just wanted to make sure, you were aware of it - I thought you were.
081:28:00|P|PAO|The 6.7 level was established to be aware and watch. The medics agreed, however, it would be desirable to raise that number to - for the canisters - to 15 mm CO<sub>2</sub> in order to perserve the lifetime on these canisters. And at MSC in the laboratories we have run tests with subjects at levels up to 22 mm of CO<sub>2</sub> with no ill effects on the subjects. We're at 1 hour - 81 hours, 29 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
081:28:03|T|CDR|We're saving all the water we can.
081:30:12|T|CMP|... for a minute?
081:30:16|T|CDR|With the new space we're in. We've just about slowed down. We're damping right.
081:31:53|T|LMP|There she is.
081:32:34|T|LMP|And, Houston, Aquarius.
081:32:39|C|Brand|Houston. Go ahead.
081:32:43|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. A couple of items we uncovered for that cartridge mod. One is the special dust covering bag that we were going to use on the tote bags, that is pretty thick and nonporous; and we went up to the upstairs kitchen and drained water a couple of more times, and made up a whole bunch of drink bags, again; and from the pantry, we retrieved a fairly large - enclosed - enclosure made of plastic that those drink bags are in that I think we can scissor and also make do for a cover, taping it on, if that's appropriate.
081:33:34|C|Brand|Okay. Jack Lousma here has a refined version of the procedure on how to make these the easy way, and I think before too long he ought to be reading that up to you. If -
081:33:52|T|LMP|Okay.
081:33:53|C|Brand|It's not time critical to get this up to you. It's just that, before you get too far in assembling these on your own, we'd kind of like to give you the benefit of experience down here.
081:34:10|T|LMP|Okay. Who - Who built them back there.
081:34:17|C|Brand|Tony did some of it, and Jack's been working on it, too. So we've had a big effort on it.
081:34:27|T|LMP|Great.
081:34:37|C|Brand|We would encourage you to wait until tomorrow to receive that procedure, but we can send it up sooner, if you insist. Over.
081:34:47|T|LMP|No, that's all right, Vance. Before we have to worry about that I guess we got another primary and three secondaries to go through.
081:34:58|C|Brand|That's right.
081:35:18|T|CDR|You know, sometimes those cartridges have a - seems they rejuvenate.
081:35:29|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
081:35:32|T|LMP|Man, that's a wicked low pressure down there.
081:35:38|T|CDR|I wish I was in it.
081:35:42|T|LMP|(Laughter).
081:35:44|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
081:35:47|T|LMP|... up ...
081:35:49|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
081:35:50|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. Your rates are once again looking good so we can continue on with the rest of this procedure. Request you go ahead with the Verb 76, Enter, and Mode Control, to Att Hold, and then the last step, 30 clicks yaw right.
081:36:13|T|LMP|Jets are firing again.
081:36:18|T|CDR|Okay. I'll do a Verb 76, Enter with the Mode Control Att Hold and then 30 clicks of right yaw to set the maneuver.
081:36:26|C|Brand|Verb 76, Enter.
081:36:31|T|CDR|Roger.
081:36:36|T|CDR|There's your Verb 76, Enter. Mode Control in Att Hold. Now you want me to do 30 clicks of right yaw?
081:36:58|T|CDR|Vance, did you say for me to hold on the right yaw or do you want me to start it now?
081:37:04|C|Brand|No, no need to hesitate, you can start now.
081:37:10|T|CDR|Okay.
081:37:20|C|Brand|After you get that going, then we'll think about powering down the PGNS.
081:37:39|T|CDR|Okay. There were 30 clicks of right yaw.
081:37:43|C|Brand|Okay. We'd like to look at it for just a little while before we power down the PGNS, so stand by.
081:38:00|T|CDR|Understand you're planning to power down the PGNS?
081:38:06|C|Brand|Right. We want to get the amps down.
081:38:09|T|CDR|Okay.
081:38:10|T|LMP|...
081:38:19|T|CDR|That's bad news.
081:38:20|T|CDR|Take 26 pictures ...
081:38:23|T|LMP|Why not?
081:38:29|T|LMP|You want to bring all the film back empty?
081:38:38|T|LMP|I'd like to just ... and shoot it.
081:38:42|T|LMP|Every last lousy one of them.
081:39:10|T|CDR|Well, that means I've got to -
081:39:14|T|CDR|Hey, let me see if I can get this started here.
081:39:18|T|LMP|Okay.
081:39:37|T|LMP|Hey, Jim.
081:39:40|T|CDR|Yes, we'll probably get there for a while.
081:41:39|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Request Aft Omni.
081:41:54|T|LMP|You got it, Vance?
081:41:56|C|Brand|Roger. That did it. Thank you.
081:42:27|T|LMP|Gad, there's Ptolemaeus and Alphonsus.
081:42:30|T|CMP|Yes, sure enough.
081:42:32|T|LMP|See them right over the edge.
081:43:11|T|CMP|Here, let me shoot a few pictures of the old Moon here.
081:43:15|T|CDR|Yes. (cough) Which is ... Did you put it back ?
081:43:19|T|LMP|Yes.
081:43:21|T|CDR|Looks like we got to do a Earth, Sun alignment?
081:43:24|T|LMP|We need it aligned again.
081:43:42|T|CDR|You don't think that burn was enough, do you? Without a midcourse?
081:43:48|T|LMP|The RCS is worse.
081:43:50|T|CDR|Yes. And RCS ... in attitude.
081:44:29|T|LMP|Hell and here ought to come up the Sun. Yes, you got us in the right plane, Jim. We're in the right plane. We're pointed off and we'll swerve on again with the Earth, Moon, and Sun.
081:44:52|T|CDR|In another respect, it might be easier to get a -
081:44:58|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 81 hours, 45 minutes now into the flight. Apollo 13 presently 115 - 11,587 nautical miles [21,459 km] away from the Moon and travelling at a velocity of 4,600 feet per second [1,402 m/s].
081:45:05|T|LMP|Look in the rear detent now. Go to -
081:45:15|T|LMP|How's that?
081:45:17|T|CDR|Awful.
081:45:19|T|LMP|Oh, that's right. That blasted service - Command Module is back there. Scratch that one. That one?
081:45:33|T|CDR|It's not much better. Okay, let's go this one.
081:45:38|T|LMP|You can go ahead, play with it.
081:45:41|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
081:45:46|T|CDR|Go ahead.
081:45:47|C|Brand|Jim, we have some status information for you, if you're ready to copy on a piece of scratch paper.
081:45:58|T|LMP|Stand by, Vance.
081:45:59|C|Brand|Okay.
081:46:04|T|CDR|What you looking for you?
081:46:06|T|LMP|Put that away and get some status paper here.
081:46:11|T|CDR|Go ahead, Vance.
081:46:13|C|Brand|Okay. First, midcourse correction will probably be at GET 104 hours, and all we look for is a 4 to 6 feet per second Delta-V. Okay. That's the first item. Now, I will give you a rundown on consumables. Okay. In the LM, you have 1498 - that is 1 4 9 8 amp-hours remaining. That means over 61 hours you'd - That would average out to 24.5 amps. We expect that, after powerdown, that you will use 1 4 or 14 amps per hour, and that would leave a reserve of 500 amp-hours at the end of the mission. Are you with me?
081:47:29|T|CDR|Roger. We're with you.
081:47:30|T|LMP|That's the same as my number was yesterday.
081:47:33|C|Brand|Okay. In the LM, you have -
081:47:36|T|CDR|We're with you.
081:47:37|C|Brand|Roger. In the LM, you have 215, that is 2 1 5, pounds of water, usable. That would average out over 61 hours to 3.5 pounds per hour available. Okay.
081:48:15|C|Brand|Okay. And after you power down, we expect that you will be using water at the rate of 3.2 to 2.7 pounds - That's at 14 amps per hour electrical usage rate. One note, this does not - When we speak here of water available, this does not include CSM water and PLSS water, so that's added on. Okay, next, LiOH. Using the CSM cans, you will have 16 cans at 12 hours per can to give you 1 9 2, or 192 hours, of LiOH. And, in the LM, using its cans, you have 44 hours remaining.
081:49:29|T|CDR|Vance, is that with the PLSS secondaries?
081:49:34|C|Brand|That's affirm. That's affirm. That includes PLSS secondaries.
081:49:47|C|Brand|Okay; oxygen. You have remaining 44 pounds in the LM. At a usage rate of 0.36 pounds per hour, that leaves you 120, or 1 2 0, hours of oxygen. Okay. Next, RCS. RCS A stands at 6 2 percent and B at 6 2 percent. We only expect 2 percent to be used for the PTC, so you're in good shape for RCS. Next, DPS Delta-V. You have 1190 feet per second remaining. And, finally, CSM EPS. We estimate that you have 99 amp-hours. That's an estimate. And that's it. Over.
081:51:19|T|CDR|Okay. I copied.
081:51:24|C|Brand|Okay. And just a question. It would be interesting to hear from Jack to see if he thinks that main B bus is good. If he has any idea of how, if whether it's good or not, this would influence our steps in the future; for example, we might want to try to test main B to see if it is, in fact, good so that we'd know how to set switches for entry.
081:52:00|T|CDR|Roger. Just a minute. They want to know whether you think Main Bus B is any good for the Command Module.
081:52:14|T|CDR|Vance while Jack's getting on the loop, let me pose the question of how we're planning on doing this midcourse, if we are going to power down the PGNS.
081:52:27|C|Brand|Would you stand by on that, Jim? We'd like to give you a procedure for that later on.
081:52:34|T|CDR|Okay. Got a midcourse at 104 hours, He's going to give us a procedure for that later on.
081:52:48|C|Brand|In short, Jim, we don't expect any problem, but we'll explain further later on.
081:53:00|T|CDR|Okay.
081:53:02|C|Brand|Deke says get a night's sleep. He says you've been working hard, and you ought to relax a little bit and be ready for tomorrow.
081:53:17|T|CMP|Vance, this is Jack.
081:53:19|C|Brand|Go ahead, Jack.
081:53:23|T|CMP|Okay. Let me give you my observations on Main Bus B. Things happened pretty fast there, and we first heard the impact or explosion or whatever caused it, I'm not sure. The next - About 1 second later, there was a Master Alarm which was the Main Bus B Undervolt. I looked at the voltage, and the voltage was good at this time so I'm suspecting it was a spike. Fuel cell 3 was also good, with good flow. However, Fred, at that point, was coming into the Command Module and got over into his seat. At that time, we shortly had an AC Bus 2 light about the time he got into his seat. He looked at the Main Bus B and the Main Bus B was reading zero. It, however, - and the fuel cell flows were zero. I'm kind of suspecting that perhaps we do have a Main - a current Main Bus B. But that's merely a guess. I never did try to reset it. We were having other problems with the Main Bus A, having an Undervolt and a few other things like that. I'd kind of like to hear what your feelings are down there.
081:54:55|C|Brand|Well, Jack, we copy your information. And we'd like to hold off because we're still working the problem. So we'll have to give you information later.
081:55:14|C|Brand|Thank you.
081:55:23|C|Brand|Aquarius, request Aft Omni.
081:55:37|T|CMP|Vance, are you back with me?
081:55:40|C|Brand|Roger. We're with you.
081:55:44|T|CMP|Okay. We lost lock there. We switched Omnis. Just for my own - kind of to get my thoughts in order, I'd kind of hear what - I'd like to hear what kind of entry you're planning. EMS or PGNCS or what?
081:56:02|C|Brand|Okay. PGNCS entry is being planned, and people are at work on checklist changes and that sort of thing.
081:56:14|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine.
081:56:18|C|Brand|And - we'll - We'll give you the CSM stuff tomorrow, but basically we expect that Main Bus B is good and we're going to work up a procedure to test it.
081:56:32|T|CMP|Okay. Those are my thoughts, too.
081:56:34|C|Brand|Roger -
081:56:36|T|CMP|You think Main Bus B is good, don't you?
081:56:39|C|Brand|That's affirm. We think it is, but we want to check it out anyway.
081:56:42|C|Slayton|We think you guys are in great shape, all the way around. Why don't you quit worrying and go to sleep.
081:56:46|T|CMP|Okay, Vance.
081:56:51|T|CMP|Oh, that - That's our boss, Deke.
081:56:58|T|CDR|Well, I think we just might do that - or part of us will.
081:57:25|T|CMP|I mixed up. How many more of those - Are we hot mike?
081:57:28|T|CDR|Yes.
081:57:36|T|CMP|Yes, I'm mixed up. You had 15? I mixed up seven more. So we got 22. By the way, there's still some water that's - it's not enough pressure to mix up another drink, but there is some water out of there, if you want to get some water out of the drink cup.
081:57:59|T|CDR|That's good; I could use some.
081:58:00|T|CMP|We ought to use that oxygen up and not waste it. (Cough)
081:58:17|T|CDR|You monitoring ... ?
081:58:23|T|CDR|Yes. Just stand by.
081:58:25|T|LMP|What'll it take to ... , okay.
081:58:29|T|CMP|Yes.
081:58:30|T|LMP|You only got two Omnis there, so if you ...
081:58:34|T|CMP|I will.
081:58:49|T|CMP|You wouldn't believe it, but I'm now in command of the LM. Okay. Vance, I'm probably the only CMP that's ever witnessed a DPS burn sitting on the ascent engine can.
081:59:33|T|CMP|Did you get some? Is there any coming out still? They didn't answer. I think we made it. How's this working out?
081:59:52|T|CDR|Okay. No problem.
081:59:55|T|CMP|They are, huh? How are we going to get an alignment?
082:00:03|T|CDR|We'll pull one out some ways, I guess. We've gotta watch that one right there.
082:00:18|T|CMP|It's decreasing now. It'll - it'll - It's cold. I noticed that in the Command Module. It'll wobble.
082:00:51|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
082:00:59|T|CDR|Switch Omnis, try it now.
082:01:02|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
082:01:04|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
082:01:08|T|CDR|Roger. Are you planned to set up here very shortly - a powerdown procedure?
082:01:15|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, if you'll take out your contingency book and turn to page Power 6. Over.
082:01:23|T|CDR|Roger. Stand by. Contingency Power 6. Get the book over here. Contingency Power 6.
082:01:33|T|CMP|Well, I hope this ...
082:01:37|C|Lousma|And while you're doing that, let's put Attitude Control, three, switches to Mode Control.
082:01:50|T|CDR|All three Attitude Control switches have been in Mode Control.
082:01:53|C|Lousma|Okay. And when you get to Power 6, you ought to see a circuit breaker page, panel 11.
082:02:02|T|CDR|Have a pencil? Let's see it.
082:02:10|T|CMP|Red.
082:02:12|T|CDR|Okay. I have Power 6, panel 11.
082:02:17|C|Lousma|Okay. On Power 6, panel 11 - The top three rows, configure them as you see them.
082:02:31|T|CDR|Okay, now, Jack ... now. We have put the TCAs in for the previous procedure. Do you want those out, now?
082:02:48|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. Jim, Pull them out. TCAs open.
082:02:54|T|CDR|Okay. I'm changing those to - back again. First three rows. And you're pulling the ATCA PGNS, huh.
082:03:04|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. Pull ATCA PGNS open.
082:03:11|T|CDR|Okay. I've done that.
082:03:20|C|Lousma|Okay. Are you ready for the fourth row?
082:03:25|T|CDR|Affirm.
082:03:27|C|Lousma|Okay. Now when we get in the fourth row, we're going to open the IMU OPERATE circuit breaker; and what that means is that we're going to lose the capability to watch your CDUs, so we're not going to be able to see your attitude. Therefore, we will not be able to advise you on which antenna to select for communications. The way we want you to handle that is to turn the LM Uplink Squelch off, and when you hear the noise, switch antennas. We'll be able to see you switch antennas, and it's going to take us about 3 to 5 minutes to establish a lockon again after you switch. After each time that you switch antennas, we will initiate a voice check. And basically when you see the Earth out the window, you can be on Forward antenna, and when the Moon's up in the window use the Aft antenna. You copy?
082:04:39|P|PAO|That's Jack Lousma on the capsule communicator position.
082:04:41|T|CDR|Okay. We're going to pull the IMU OPERATE circuit breaker, so you won't be able to see our attitude. Therefore, you won't tell us how to switch antennas and we'll enable the - I will turn the - up the Squelch Off so that when we start getting any static, we'll switch antennas and as a thumb rule we could use - with the Earth forward, we use the Forward antenna and when we see the Moon we use the Aft antenna.
082:05:12|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jim. In other words, we're leaving the antenna switching up to you, and after you switch antennas it's going to take 3 to 5 minutes for us to establish a lockon again, and we'll initiate a voice check. And I'm ready to go on panel 11, row 4.
082:05:34|T|CDR|Okay.
082:05:36|C|Lousma|Okay. On row 4, under Heaters RCS System A/B-1: open Quad 1 through 4; under ECS, the only change is - under Glycol Pumps, close Auto Transfer; under Comm, the only change is: open VHF A Receiver, open Commander Audio; under PGNS, the only change is: close and leave closed IMU Standby circuit breaker, so we can have heaters. Read back.
082:06:30|T|CDR|Okay. On row 4, we're going to open all four off the heaters - the RCS System A and B - the first four circuit breakers. We're going to close the Auto Transfer. We're going to open the VHF A Receiver and the Commander Audio. And we're going to close the IMU Standby. The LGC DSKY and the IMU Operate will be open.
082:07:05|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jim. All other breakers in that row are as you see them in the checklist. And on row 5, the only change is that we want you to, under EPS, open Ascent ECA Control. Over.
082:07:25|T|CDR|Roger. I think we already have that opened - Ascent ECA Control is probably already open.
082:07:41|T|CDR|Okay. So let me confirm. We'll have one Comm system, that will be the LMP system, and we'll have to do our own antenna switching; therefore, we'll have to wait about - Okay, why don't you switch? Aft antenna.
082:08:04|T|CDR|We'll have to wait for you to get a lockon again. Is that correct?
082:08:14|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jim. You'll be working off of the LMP's panel over there.
082:08:22|T|CDR|Okay. What else do you have for me?
082:08:24|C|Lousma|Okay. Panel 16, that's on page Power-7. Top row, the only change is: under RCS System B, open PQGS/Displays. Over.
082:08:50|T|CDR|Okay. I may go over this with you, Jack, because this checklist has been written over two or three times now on our various procedures. Top row, the first two are open, the next three are closed, and we're going to open now the Quad TCA's 1, 2, 3, 4; Crossfeed will be closed, and the Temp/Press Display flag will be opened, and we're going  to open up the PQGS, Main SOV will be closed, and the ... will be opened.
082:09:26|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jim. And there's no change to the second row. Over.
082:09:38|T|CDR|Okay. Again, let me go through this with you. The first four are going to be closed. The next sev - eight will be - the next nine will be open from Logic Power B through Descent Engine Override. How about the CWEA? Is that going to be closed?
082:10:08|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jim. We want the next five closed.
082:10:15|T|CDR|Okay.
082:10:16|C|Lousma|Okay. In the third row, under Comm: Display, Open; SE Audio, Closed; VHF A Transmitter, Open - That's a change - VHF B Receiver, Open; Primary S-Band, Power Amplifier, Open; Transmitter/Receiver, Closed; S-Band Antenna, Open; PMP, Closed; TV, Open. Under ECS: Displays, Open; Glycol Pump Secondary, Open; LGC Pump, Open; Cabin Fan Control, Open; Cabin Repress, Closed; and all the next four, Closed also. Read back.
082:11:12|T|CDR|Okay. We have Display, Open; SE Audio, Closed; VHF A Transmitter, Open; VHF B Receiver, Open; Power Amp's going to be Open; Transmitter/Receiver, Closed; S-Band Antenna, Open; PMP, Closed; TV, Open; Display is Open; next three are Open; Cabin Repress, Closed; and all the rest, Closed.
082:11:36|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jim. And in row 4, under Heaters, we want them all - Correction - we want all the Quad Heaters, Open. Correction - we want all the Quad Heaters, Closed.
082:11:53|T|CDR|All the -
082:11:54|C|Lousma|We want Display, Open; S-Band Antenna, Closed - to avoid a Master Alarm, Camera - Sequence Camera, Open; And under EPS, we want Displays, Open; DC Bus Volt, Closed; Inverter 2, Open; Ascent ECA, Closed; Ascent ECA Control, Open; Descent ECA, Closed; Descent ECA Control, Closed; Translunar Bus Tie, Close; we want the Cross Tie Bus, Open; the Bal Loads, Closed; Bat Feed Ties, Closed. How do you read?
082:12:46|T|CDR|Okay. The four RCS Heaters will be Closed; Displays, Open; S-Band Antenna, Closed; Camera Sequence will be Open; Display will be Open; DC Bus Volt will be Closed; Inverter 2, Open; Ascent ECA will be Closed, but the Ascent ECA Control, Open; Descent ECA, Closed; Descent ECA Control, Closed; Translunar Bus Tie, Closed; and Cross Tie Bus, Open; and Balance Loads, Closed; and the Bat Feed Ties, Closed. I have one question, Jack. On panel - on the second line there under Lighting, why are we keeping: the Floods and Track closed? Or are they going to be open?
082:13:33|C|Lousma|Negative. We have the, Lighting breakers all closed. Control the lighting with the switches and rheostats. Over.
082:13:44|T|CDR|Okay. We don't need the floodlights, I don't think, but we can do it that way, I guess.
082:13:50|T|CMP|We haven't used them so far.
082:13:52|C|Lousma|And under row 4, under RCS Systems A/B-2, Quad Heaters, you notice that we've closed those circuit breakers, but what we want you to do is to - on panel 3, turn the RCS A/B-2 Quad switches 1, 2, 3, and 4, off. Over.
082:14:28|C|Lousma|And we're going to watch your quad temps for you, and when we need to warm them up a little bit, we'll tell you to throw those four switches on - on panel 3.
082:14:43|T|CDR|Okay. Now are we sure that this PTC mode is - good enough so we don't start get crossed up later and get out of configuration.
082:14:53|C|Lousma|Stand by 1 on that, Jim. Okay, Jim, as far as we can tell right now, the PTC looks as good as any PTC we've ever seen in a CSM, so we're going to go with what we've got.
082:15:16|T|CDR|Okay.
082:15:18|C|Lousma|Okay, and if you turn over the page on Power 8, we have the spacecraft functions remaining to you. We've got low bit rate TM. However, we don't have any VHF. We have CWEA. We have Glycol Pumps. We have Suit Fans. We have Cabin Repress for you, and stand by in Attitude Control here. Okay, in Attitude Control, we'll have hardovers for uses in emergency, and for normal usage we want to have a 15-minute delay to get the heaters on to warm them up before use. How do you read?
082:16:06|T|CDR|Okay. For emergency, we have the hardovers and for normal use it requires a 15-minute request to get the heaters on.
082:16:16|C|Lousma|That's affirmative.
082:16:28|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim, that concludes our powerdown procedure, and we're waiting for you to get with it
082:16:37|T|CDR|Okay, Jack, we'll start. I sure hate to lose the PGNS. I sure hope that procedure for the midcourse is a good one.
082:16:44|C|Lousma|It is.
082:16:55|T|CMP|You want me to help you here?
082:16:57|T|CDR|Yes, you can - Okay. Firstly power down panel 11. All of them open.
082:17:15|T|CDR|Closed.
082:17:24|T|CMP|Yes.
082:17:56|T|CDR|Stand by for a Master Alarm.
082:17:57|T|CMP|Okay.
082:18:12|T|CDR|Here it comes.
082:18:54|T|CMP|LTG. You just did it.
082:19:18|T|CDR|I'll give you this when I'm finished. After we go through this, then you can go through it again and double check it.
082:19:23|T|CMP|Okay.
082:20:07|T|CMP|Now, the flood lights are on, right? No, I kind of don't think we need them though, do you?
082:20:15|T|CDR|Don't pull those. Give me the - first four. We'll get back there. Those four are Close, Open, Open, Engine Arm, Open, ... ACA PNGS, ABORT STAGE, ACA AGS, ... standby ... SE AUDIO
082:22:36|T|CDR|Say, Houston; Aquarius.
082:22:38|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
082:22:40|T|CMP|It won't take him a minute to ...
082:22:43|T|CDR|You're familiar with our particular spacecraft that on panel 16 Heaters RCS Systems A and B, Quad 1 Heater circuit breaker has been pushed in, and sealed in, and if it's ever pushed out, it's doubtful if we'll ever be able to reset it.
082:23:06|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim, on the four Quad Heater breakers, we want you to leave them closed. And we'll operate the heaters with the switches on panel 3. Over.
082:23:19|T|CDR|Okay.
082:23:27|T|CDR|No.
082:24:07|T|CDR|Okay. We'll do that here.
082:24:11|T|CDR|Okay. And I'm closing the Heaters on panel 4, Quad 1 through 4, Off.
082:24:23|C|Lousma|Okay. It's time for you guys to get to bed and get Fred up.
082:24:33|T|CDR|(Laughter) I still have one question, Jack. I still think that - I still say that the - on the Lighting in our panel 16, the Flood lights and the Track should be open. We're not using them.
082:24:53|C|Lousma|No problem, Jim. Go ahead and open them, Track and Flood, that's all right.
082:25:03|T|CMP|Okay, Track and Flood are Open.
082:25:07|T|CDR|Now, why don't you go through that, Jack, and make sure those -
082:25:10|T|CMP|Yes.
082:25:12|T|CDR|- ...
082:25:15|T|CMP|Okay, I'll take this.
082:25:16|T|CDR|Okay, Jack, my only other concern now is the CO<sub>2</sub> rise in the spacecraft. I guess you're keeping a handle on that?
082:25:26|C|Lousma|That's affirmed, Jim. We have up to 10.6 now, and we're willing to go a little higher on that. We have another cartridge and we have a procedure for making the Command Module cartridges up. We'll pass that on later.
082:25:42|T|CDR|Oh, yes. I'm not worried about that. I just wanted to make sure that you -
082:25:46|T|CMP|Are they going to -
082:25:47|T|CDR|- that - We just don't want to go to sleep here and forget about the rise in CO<sub>2</sub>.
082:25:51|T|CMP|Are they going to use ... -
082:25:52|C|Lousma|Roger. We're watching it for you -
082:25:54|T|CDR|Yes, they're getting it ...
082:25:55|C|Lousma|- We have it here. It's now 10.7 and we have a medical Go to 15 millimeters.
082:26:03|T|CMP|That's a new one.
082:26:04|T|CDR|There's a new first for you.
082:26:19|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim, we estimate we've got 1 more hour on the primary cartridge, and 6 or 7 hours on the secondary.
082:26:31|T|CDR|Okay. Fine. Say, it's a spare primary cartridge back there, too, isn't it? So that's good for another, how long?
082:27:10|T|CMP|Yes. Yes. That's yours though, isn't it?
082:27:14|C|Lousma|And you're right, Jim. We've got another primary cartridge back there behind the ascent engine cover.
082:27:21|T|CDR|Right, yes. We know. Thank you.
082:27:43|T|CMP|Yes, yes, I just -
082:27:51|T|CMP|Okay. I guess you've done everything right on that panel. Let me check the middle one. Yes. You powered down and then you leave me. Tell me, I've got it.
082:28:05|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack, we just thought it's about time you got a LM checkout.
082:28:16|T|CMP|But he's giving it to me inert. Of course, I'm giving him my Command Module, too, which is rather inert right now, too.
082:28:32|C|Lousma|Well, you've got to walk before you run, you know.
082:30:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 82 hours, 30 minutes. Here in Mission Control at this time we're in the process of completing a shift change. Flight Director Milton Windler and his Maroon team of flight controllers replacing Flight Director Gene Kranz and the White team. On board the spacecraft, the Flight Plan calls for the - two of the crewmen, commander Jim Lovell and Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert to begin a 5-hour rest period shortly. All three crewmen are scheduled to be eating at this time or to have finished by now. The Lunar Module has been essentially powered down, and at the present time we're showing a total current on the Lunar Module ranging between 14 and 15 or 16 amps, which is about what was expected.
082:36:42|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston.
082:37:07|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
082:37:15|T|CMP|Go ahead, Jack.
082:37:19|C|Lousma|Roger. For your information, Jack -
082:37:20|T|CMP|You're loud and clear.
082:37:21|C|Lousma|- all of our analysis is based on powerdown to 14 amps, but we're reading on you right now 12.3 and so we're better off than we were in our analysis.
082:37:38|T|CMP|That sounds good.
082:38:12|T|CMP|Jack, I thought you were going to get the sleep shift where there wasn't any excitement?
082:38:18|C|Lousma|Well, I tried, but I didn't make it. I thought you were supposed to be sleeping now.
082:38:31|T|CMP|Well, Freddo is getting something to eat, and Jim is starting to sack out so I'm taking the comm here until Fred gets done.
082:38:42|C|Lousma|Okay.
082:38:55|P|PAO|That was Jack Swigert reporting that Jim Lovell, at the present time, is resting, and Fred Haise is getting something to eat and when Fred finishes eating Jack Swigert is scheduled to get a bit of rest.
082:39:19|T|CMP|As I just - Yes, are you ready to take over? Well, he just - he just asked - said he thought I was supposed to be sleeping. And I told him that I was waiting for you to - Okay. You were off the net when they explained the - But don't they - Can't we monitor our CDU's any more to tell when to switch antennas, so they've just - When they can see it switch - it will take a couple of minutes for them to get up. And they'll always make a voice check with you.
082:40:28|T|CMP|It came out here. I caught it. Okay. Now, are you getting squared away, I'll give you the comm here.
082:40:51|T|CMP|Oh. No, no ...
082:40:56|T|CMP|They're showing right now 12.3 amps. Their analysis is based on 14 so they're in better - Okay. Headset's yours.
082:42:12|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. How do you read?
082:42:17|C|Lousma|Hearing you loud and clear, Fred. How me?
082:42:21|T|LMP|Okay.
082:42:22|C|Lousma|Okay, I heard the  -
082:42:23|T|LMP|I see you luck out with all the good shifts.
082:42:27|C|Lousma|Yes, I got all the good deals. I heard Jack brief you on the comm mode so, you got any questions about that?
082:42:40|T|LMP|Okay.
082:43:06|C|Lousma|And how is your PTC going? I heard Jack tell you that we can't see your CDU's. How's it going?
082:43:17|T|LMP|Well, let's see, we may be offsetting slightly, the Sun looks like it may be a little higher now, I'll have to wait. Now here comes the Earth by and it looks about the same perspective. I'll have to wait to see the Moon on the other side, Jack. I'll switch to FORWARD OMNI.
082:43:37|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred, I can't hear you any more on account of the background noise. I assume that - I think I heard Jack tell you what we're going to do about comm. UPLINK SQUELCH, off. You'll take care of the antennas because we can't see your attitude. We'll give you a voice check when come up. it'll take us 3 to 5 minutes to come up. And to make it astronaut-proof, when you see the Earth, use a forward antenna; when you see the Moon, use the aft one.
082:44:08|T|LMP|Yes, that's pretty straightforward. Okay, I see the Earth so I've very wisely shifted to FORWARD.
082:44:17|C|Lousma|Good boy.
082:46:10|T|LMP|Got another battery?
082:46:12|T|LMP|... really sick.
082:46:14|T|LMP|Earth will be by over there in a minute.
082:47:24|T|LMP|And, Jack, you still up?
082:47:28|C|Lousma|Still here, Fred.
082:47:32|T|LMP|Okay, when I was upstairs, just a minute ago, I noticed what appeared to be some new ventings from down the Service Module way. I noticed that out window 1, and also saw one chunk of metal - loose metal about 4 inches square that was tumbling around - silver in color, and it looked like it had come from somewhere down in the Service Module.
082:48:04|C|Lousma|Okay. You saw some venting out window 1  -
082:48:05|T|LMP|And I  -
082:48:08|C|Lousma|Go ahead.
082:48:10|T|LMP|Yes, that's where I happened to be looking. The lighting was such that it showed up out there. What reminded me of it was I'm looking out the LM window now and I see a good part of the new star field it's created for us. There are about a thousand little sparklies out here.
082:48:30|C|Lousma|Okay, so you're seeing some venting out window 1, and you saw a 4-inch-square piece of loose metal which was silver, and - Are you still seeing the venting or has it zeroed out now?
082:48:48|T|LMP|I don't know. I left upstairs, I'm down in the LM now, Jack. I guess when Jack goes up he can take a look and let me know. Okay, I'll think about switching aft here directly. I see the Moon, and the Moon looks pretty good, Jack, so I guess our PTC still going pretty good.
082:49:09|C|Lousma|Okay, and we won't have any comm delay if the PTC stays good.
082:49:32|T|LMP|Yes, sure enough the Moon is getting smaller.
082:49:37|C|Lousma|Good, and we want to ask you another question about the venting. Is this - would you suppose - some new venting or is this venting that you just hadn't - that's been going on all the time, but which you hadn't looked at recently?
082:49:56|T|LMP|I can't really say, Jack, we've been so tied up down in the LM, I guess we kind of forgot about the other half. But I've been upstairs several times and hadn't particularly noticed any flow by the windows before, so I - my first assumption was that it was some new venting. It really wasn't very heavy.
082:50:23|C|Lousma|Okay. Copy. Thank you.
082:50:25|T|LMP|And Jack's going up to take a look now.
082:50:27|C|Lousma|Okay. And for your information, all of our numbers are based on amperage usage of 14 amps. And we're using only 12.3, so we're a little fat on our analysis.
082:50:49|T|LMP|Very good. Way to be.
082:50:52|C|Lousma|And we're in a  -
082:50:53|T|LMP|I'll tell you, this Aquarius has really been a winner.
082:51:01|C|Lousma|Well, that's one of several. And we want to tell you something that I told Jim earlier, and that concerns control. Right now you have control in hardover if you need it, but when we go to some normal control modes, since we have the quad heaters off. We want to have a 15-minute notice for attitude control request. Over.
082:51:35|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. Offhand, I can't imagine that since we got the platform powered down why we'd need to worry about the instantaneous control. But at any rate, we need 15-minutes warmup with the heaters before we can start using thrusters.
082:51:54|C|Lousma|Right. And another thing we've done is to pull your ECS and EPC DISPLAY breakers and so - But we left your CAUTION and WARNING powered up. So if you get ECS-type or EPS CAUTION and WARNING you'll have to power up those meters with the DISPLAY breakers. And we are watching for you your PIPA temperatures, your ASA TEMP, your propellant temperatures except for the DPS propellant, and we're watching your quad temps for you.
082:52:31|T|LMP|Okay. That's very good, Jack. You're watching them. That's good enough.
082:52:41|C|Lousma|And everybody's fine at home El Lago.
082:52:50|T|LMP|Great.
082:53:35|C|Lousma|And, Fred, your CO<sub>2</sub> is building up. It's at 11.3 on our gage, and we've got a medical go up to 15 millimeters, at which time we'll switch over to secondary. Looks like we've got plenty of lithium hydroxide, about 192 hours including the CSM cartridges. And as you know, we've got a way to use those. And as soon as we get them written in some good words, why, we'll pass; that along. You might be able to make one.
082:54:13|T|LMP|Okay. Yes, we'll sure give her a try. And I'm showing onboard about 12-1/2 millimeters of mercury.
082:54:24|C|Lousma|Roger. And I have a Flight Plan update when you get a time to copy it sometime, I'll pass it along. There's no hurry on it.
082:54:35|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by 1. Jack's back now.
082:54:48|T|LMP|Okay. Jack just came back and he said it's still coming out; it's coming out only on the commander's side. So he saw it out the same window I did, window 1. And it's between the minus Y and minus Z axis.
082:55:07|C|Lousma|Okay. And of course  -
082:55:08|T|LMP|Jack says it's definitely the Service Module which was - which was my impression, too.
082:55:14|C|Lousma|Okay. So you're sure it's the Service Module, and, of course, the thing we're interested in knowing, is it something that is residual from before, or is it something new. And if you have any ideas about that, why we'd  sure like to have them.
082:55:41|T|LMP|Yes. Yes, Jack, I'll answer him your question in a minute, but make Jack's first impression here, is that it's not near the intensity that it was right after our mishap. And I'll have to agree with that. I'd say - he said it was a half and I said it was maybe down to a third. And Houston would like to know if you have any impressions as to whether it is still a residual from that or maybe something new.
082:56:25|T|LMP|I don't know why after I felt that. Yes, I felt it was some new something - new venting, too.
082:57:06|T|LMP|Okay. Switch to FORWARD OMNI.
082:57:11|C|Lousma|Freddo, if you think it's practical, we're ready to give you some - we're working on some camera settings for pictures of the venting. And, if you have a camera out and ready to go, let us know which one it is so we can get the settings for that camera. What do you think about that.
082:57:30|T|LMP|Okay. Jack's got the one with the 250-millimeters lens on it. That's the standard EL. And I have a surface camera out that I've been shooting hundreds of Earth/Moon pictures with, camera 1. And we also have the Reseau upstairs that's pretty handy. The Command Module DC camera. So you can about  -
082:58:00|C|Lousma|Okay. I copy that  -
082:58:01|T|LMP|-  take your choice, on those.
082:58:04|C|Lousma|I copy the 250 millimeter, the Reseau is available, but I didn't get what other one is.
082:58:14|T|LMP|Okay. I got my Hasselblad surface camera down in the LM here handy, too, camera 1.
083:00:04|T|LMP|And, Jack, if we're going to do any picture taking out the Command Module windows, I think we'd better do that pretty quick, or hold up until Jim and Jack get their rest done.
083:00:21|C|Lousma|We concur with that.
083:01:23|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred, we're not going to bother the skipper up there. We won't be taking any pictures out of the Command Module window until after rest period.
083:01:34|T|LMP|Okay.
083:01:49|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 83 hours 2 minutes. Fred Haise has the watch at the present time in the Lunar Module, while Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert attempt to get some rest in the Command Module. The Flight Plan calls for a five hour rest period for both the commander and the Command Module Pilot. A recapping briefly - Fred Haise remarks after coming back to the LM from the Command Module where he had been getting something to eat. Fred reported that he had observed some venting apparently from the Service Module and had also seen a four inch square piece of metal which he described as silver in color float by the window of the Command Module. He was looking out the number one window, which is viewed from inside the Command Module - is the window to the left of the commander's couch, the far left window. Haise was asked if he felt the venting was something new or if it was residual venting from the original event which had caused the loss of power and oxygen to the Service Module. He did not know and we also have not determined here on the ground whether this was an event associated with the original loss of power from the Service Module or whether it is something new. That's being evaluated at this time. Haise said he did feel definitely that the event was coming from the Service Module - that the piece of metal he had seen floating by was from the Service Module and that the venting was from the Service Module. Flight director Milton Windler, after reviewing the situation, elected to wait until after the commander, Jim Lovell, and the Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert had completed their rest period before attempting to get back into the Command Module and photograph the venting and whatever pieces might be visible out the window.
083:10:38|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 83 hours 11 minutes. A change of shift press briefing is being planned to being in about 10 minutes at 12:35 AM in the main auditorium at the Houston New Center. The participants in the press conference will be white team flight director Gene Kranz and astronaut Tony England. And repeating the time for that change of shift briefing is tentatively planned for 12:35 AM - about ten minutes from now.
083:10:59|T|LMP|Shifting to FORWARD OMNI.
083:11:44|C|Lousma|Okay. Fred, for your information, your CO<sub>2</sub> reading onboard is a little higher than what we're reading here on the ground, and so when it gets to 15 on your meter, switch to secondary. And we'd like to get a status about every 30 minutes - we'll give you a call on that. But just to let us know we're still thinking about you, we'd like you to go BIOMED RIGHT, please.
083:12:14|T|LMP|Okay. Going BIOMED RIGHT.
083:13:57|T|LMP|How, how do you read me on this comm mode on S-band?
083:14:03|C|Lousma|5 square, Fred. How me?
083:28:03|C|Lousma|We're still here, Fred. How's it going?
083:28:11|T|LMP|Okay. My CO<sub>2</sub> reading is now just below 13.
083:28:21|C|Lousma|Say again what it is.
083:28:25|T|LMP|It's just - just below 13.
083:28:29|C|Lousma|Okay. Just below 13. And just for your information, we've got people working on several subjects. We're working on the midcourse coming up to determine our control system and how to do it with the control system we select, what we should do about the alignment. We've got the LMS and a couple of crews cranked up working on that. And we're also working on our entry, how and when we ought to activate the CSM. And we're working on the CSM systems status. Tomorrow sometime we're going to have a MAIN BUS B checkout, so we've got a lot of people swinging pretty hard here and I've got some f-stop settings for you for the lunar surface camera. At 1/250th, we'd like you to take targets of opportunity. Each picture use three f-stops, because we don't know exactly which one is going to work the best, so use 4, 5.6, and 8 and 1/250th for the surface camera. Copy?
083:29:52|T|LMP|Okay. Use the surface camera at 1/250th, 4, 5.6, and 8. And I've been doing quite a bit of shooting at covering two of those numbers in the range 5.6, and 8. I've also been shooting some at 11, so I'll just drop it down a little more. The Moon is still so big and bright there that I got a feeling that the Moon is probably up around the f/8 to f/11 range.
083:30:26|C|Lousma|Roger, I didn't catch that last part. Maybe when the comm gets a little better you can say it again.
083:30:43|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read now, Jack?
083:30:45|C|Lousma|That's a lot better, Fred.
083:30:48|T|LMP|Okay, I just said the Moon is still so bright, that I think probably the higher range of f-stops will be better; f/8, maybe even f/11.
083:31:02|C|Lousma|Okay.
083:31:11|T|LMP|I can just barely, on the left corner of the Moon now, make out the foothills of Fra Mauro formation. We never did get to see it when we were in close, there.
083:31:33|C|Lousma|Okay. I'm reading on my monitor here, Fred, that you're 16,214 miles away from the Moon moving at about 4,500 feet per second.
083:31:55|T|LMP|Okay.
083:32:21|T|LMP|From the sounds of all the work that is going on and is still going on, this flight is probably a lot bigger test for the system on the ground than up here.
083:32:41|C|Lousma|Yes, you've been - you've been working it out a little bit.
083:32:55|T|LMP|Yes. I've really got a tough job right now switching OMNIs.
083:33:08|C|Lousma|Well, everybody down here is 100-percent optimistic. Looks like we're on the up side of the whole thing now.
083:33:21|T|LMP|Yes, I guess we had better be in good shape, particularly ourselves, rested for that entry day. I think that is going to be a pretty busy one.
083:33:33|C|Lousma|Right, and we're working on procedures for that. Ken's been doing quite a bit of work on getting ready for entry.
083:33:46|T|LMP|Very good.
083:47:12|C|Lousma|How's it going Fred?
083:47:18|T|LMP|Okay. Just fine.
083:47:20|C|Lousma|Okay. We're considering a midcourse correction at 104 hours - about 20 hours from now - 18 hours from now, and it's only 7 feet per second. The other option is to keep PTC up, since we may not be able to get back into it again, and delay it. So, that's the type of thing we're thinking about, but - just wanted to let you know that you're pretty much right in the middle of the fairway there and our present tracking, with no midcourse has you - with a Gamma of 7.11, as opposed to 6.51. So, you're already in the corridor. You're just a half a degree between the center and the outer limits and we're going to tweak that up.
083:48:15|T|LMP|Okay. That sounds good.
083:48:20|C|Lousma|And - we don't - Well, we think there might have been a misunderstanding earlier on the potable water. Don't worry about drinking water. Drink all you want. There's plenty of it. There's 38 pounds, and the Surgeon recommends that you use some of the fruit juices as well. Over.
083:48:43|T|LMP|Okay. Yes, we went up and - and used the procedure to pressurize surge tank, and Jack and I made up a total of 22 drinks of - drinking water.
083:49:02|C|Lousma|Okay.
083:49:19|C|Lousma|And I assume that Jack is up there sleeping now too, right?
083:49:26|T|LMP|Yes. That's affirm. They're both up there.
083:49:40|T|LMP|I hate to say it, Jack, but I think our PTC is about to wobble off a little bit. I've noticed that the Earth is coming by somewhat lower in the window and the Moon is going by somewhat higher.
083:49:59|C|Lousma|Okay. Understand. PTC, Earth is coming by lower and Moon is coming by higher.
083:50:09|T|LMP|Yes.
083:51:58|C|Lousma|And, Fred, on this jerry-rigged Command Module lithium hydroxide canister, what we're going to do is we're going to have to make at least two up and use two at a time - one on each set of hoses. What we'll do is we'll connect one of these jerry-rigged boxes to the red fittings and air will be sucked through the lithium hydroxide and then blown out the blue fitting. And we're also going to, when we do this, remove the LM lithium hydroxide canister from the suit loop, either the primary or the secondary, and we're getting the words together to make it easy to build one of these things, and it looks like it will probably take two guys, so, I think we probably ought to plan to do that later. In addition, we have to go up and get a couple of canisters out of the Command Module, so it looks like maybe a smart idea would be to delay a little bit and have you build a couple of these later on. What do you think?
083:53:17|T|LMP|Yes. I agree Jack. Jack Swigert and I went upstairs earlier and both got a canister, and we were scratching around for some material and thinking about using them, and that's actually why - when we made up all the water to drink because we needed the plastic container that they were housed in in the pantry, and we had that ready to use with some material plus some of the - the thick porous bags that were going to be used for the duct control that we may just cut up and use, too.
083:53:54|C|Lousma|Did you come up with a design or  -
083:53:56|T|LMP|Plus we got lots  -
083:54:00|T|LMP|No. We just thought we'd see what we had in the way of material and stand by for your word. Of course, we also have lots of stiff-backed cardboard from flight data.
083:54:15|C|Lousma|Yes. We have decided to use a canister and, you know that the liquid-cooled garment has a bag around it that we think we can use, too, or that we know we can use. We've tried it. So what you have is the - a bag within a bag and inside that is the liquid-cooled garment. The bag that is closest to the liquid-cooled garment is the one we need, and we've got two of them. And then, of course, we've got to use some tape and, as you say, one of the backs to flight data file time line book or something like that, and, just using those materials, we can make this jerry-rigged canister. So, the bag that we're looking for is the one that is right next to the liquid cooled garment, and, if we're very careful about where we cut it, we can make a pretty good rig.
083:55:28|T|LMP|Okay.
083:55:31|C|Lousma|It looks like we'll have to use that bag over again, though, because we only got two of them, and I expect that we'll have to make more than two of these canisters up.
083:55:44|T|LMP|Roger.
083:56:35|C|Lousma|Fred, in about 4 minutes, we're going to hand you over to a different communications site, and it's going to take us about a minute or so to reestablish uplink, so you can be prepared for that.
083:56:51|T|LMP|Okay, Jack.
084:00:40|C|Lousma|Freddo, we've handed over now. How do you read?
084:00:46|T|LMP|Loud and clear, Jack.
084:00:48|C|Lousma|Same here.
084:00:56|T|LMP|In fact, you're coming in a little louder.
084:01:03|C|Lousma|Fred, you'll have to say again. Can't read you there. There's too much background noise. Maybe we need a new antenna.
084:01:14|T|LMP|Okay. I'm on the other OMNI now. I just said that you're coming in even louder than previously.
084:01:24|C|Lousma|Roger. Maybe it's because I'm standing up. You're coming in better now, too.
084:04:46|T|LMP|And, for your information, Jack, I'm just going to tear into some beef and gravy and other assorted goodies.
084:05:01|C|Lousma|I presume that you're doing this with the full permission and - of the commander.
084:05:19|T|LMP|At this - at this moment, who do you think is the commander?
084:05:31|C|Lousma|If I was him, I'd make you sign out everything you ate, so I'd know.
084:05:56|T|LMP|Well, I'm sneaking inside of the LM where he doesn't have ... Incidentally, this PTC must have some - must have a wobble mode around our X-axis there because now the Moon and Earth are back in the right perspective.
084:06:18|C|Lousma|Good. Let's see if it goes the other way.
084:06:40|C|Lousma|These guys down here are saying they knew it all the time.
084:06:56|T|LMP|Well, that's right. They do good work. Whoever heard of doing a P52 in the LM?
084:07:55|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 84 hours 8 minutes. During the change of shift briefing, CAPCOM Jack Lousma kept up a fairly constant stream of communication with Fred Haise who is on-duty  -
084:08:19|P|PAO|-  who is on duty in the Command Module in the Lunar Module rather. I would like to recap for you some of the things that were discussed during that period of time. Lousma advised Haise that the mid-course correction being considered at this time is a 7 foot per second maneuver which would occur at 104 hours. The other option which  -
084:08:48|C|Lousma|Say, Fred, sometime when you're not too busy chewing on that beef, how about telling us what the CO<sub>2</sub> reads?
084:09:03|T|LMP|Okay, I'm reading 13, 1 3.
084:09:07|C|Lousma|Okay. It looks like our reading is getting kind of close to yours.
084:09:40|P|PAO|Lousma discussed with Fred Haise the options that we have on that mid-course correction at 104 hours. The other option being to delay the mid-course correction. If that were done, it would not be necessary to stop the passive thermal control mode which the Lunar Module is in at this time. That is being considered but no decision has been made. The carbon dioxide levels in the Lunar Module were also discussed and a procedure was passed up to Haise for keeping tabs on the rising CO<sub>2</sub> level, and for changing to the backup lithium hydroxide canister when the level reaches 15 millimeters of mecury - partial pressure. The surgeon also recommended that the onboard reading be used for this indication. It was felt that the onboard reading would be somewhat more accurate although we've been reading about the same thing on the ground as Haise has been reporting from the spacecraft, and at last report the level of CO<sub>2</sub> was at about 13. At one point Haise reported that the passive thermal control appeared to be degrading a bit. Said that everytime the spacecraft rotated one complete revolution, the Earth would appear to be a bit lower in the window, and the Moon appeared to be moving higher in the window. I believe you heard Haise report later that there may have been some sort of a wobble in the passive thermal control and that the Earth and Moon were now back in the proper position in the windows. So that's another area that we'll continue to watch, and see how the passive thermal control mode maintains itself. We've also had a communications hand-over. Handing over from the tracking site at Goldstone, California to the tracking site at Honeysuckle Creek, Australia.
084:14:39|T|LMP|Yes. It appears the wobble is going the other way, Jack, because the Earth is now rising and the Moon is starting to get lower in the window.
084:14:52|C|Lousma|Roger. Could you give us an LPD number periodically?
084:15:02|T|LMP|LPD number? Yes, okay.
084:15:09|C|Lousma|In fact, if you could give it two or three REVs in a row, why then we could predict where it's going and maybe help us set it up again if we have to.
084:15:22|T|LMP|Okay.
084:15:36|T|LMP|Okay. The center of the Earth has just gone by at an LPD number of 4.
084:15:42|C|Lousma|Roger. LPD 4, center of the Earth.
084:20:59|T|LMP|And the center of the Moon is about LPD 21.
084:21:04|C|Lousma|Okay. LPD 21. Is that the center of the Moon, you say?
084:21:11|T|LMP|That's affirm.
084:22:52|C|Lousma|And, Fred, we're doing a little better on our water than we had anticipated. Our numbers were designed for 3.5 pounds per hour; we're using about 3.0, and expect to go a little bit less.
084:23:11|T|LMP|Beautiful.
084:23:32|T|LMP|When this flight's all over, we'll really be able to figure out what a LM can do.
084:24:02|C|Lousma|Maybe they'll make the some more of them.
084:24:09|T|LMP|If it had a heat shield, I'd bring this one home.
084:27:18|T|LMP|Okay. The Earth went - just went by about - clear above the LPD index scribe. It was - it was, if it were extended, the number would be minus 6.
084:27:34|C|Lousma|Okay. Way up there at minus 6.
084:27:41|T|LMP|Yes, there's actually no such number. I just extended the line beyond zero which, for a negative rate, is what it would be if there was one.
084:27:53|C|Lousma|Right. Understand. If minus 6 was there, that's where it would be. Right?
084:28:02|T|LMP|That's right.
084:28:13|C|Lousma|Do you still have that super-dense star field?
084:28:25|T|LMP|It's still there. I'm looking at it right now. I can look at - the Sun is right behind me, then all these sparklies show up. Yes. It kind of looks like I'm right in the middle of the - of the Milky Way. There are several thousand little sparklies at various ranges out as far as I can see sparklies.
084:29:18|T|LMP|They're kind of interesting. They're all moving ... and sparkling there. And I guess you can distiguish, at least I think I can what will occasionally give you a real star from the bunch of sparklies, but it really does break up the capability to pick out a star pattern, particularly through something like the AOT.
084:29:52|C|Lousma|Okay. So far, we haven't identified what the sparklies are and what is venting.
084:30:12|T|LMP|Yes, I got a sneaky feeling that we probably won't be able to tell, even after we power up.
084:34:08|C|Lousma|How you feeling, Fred?
084:34:16|T|LMP|Oh, as soon as I chug down this grape drink and grapefruit - orange drink, I think I'll be in pretty good shape.
084:34:38|C|Lousma|How much sleep did you get between the burn and the time you got up for this exercise?
084:34:50|T|LMP|Oh, I'd guesstimate about 4 hours, Jack. Wait a minute, which burn you talking about?
084:35:03|C|Lousma|It was the burn we just made. Did you get any sleep between it, and the time you got up for this watch?
084:35:12|T|LMP|Oh, no. I didn't - I haven't been to bed since all the action the night before, and I went to go to bed for about 4 hours then ...
084:35:22|C|Lousma|Yes.
084:35:38|C|Lousma|Well, we're just trying to figure out who's likely to be the most tired up there. You or Jim.
084:35:55|T|LMP|I think we'll get caught up pretty good in the next couple of days.
084:36:00|C|Lousma|Say again.
084:36:04|T|LMP|We ought to get caught up pretty good in the next couple of days.
084:38:56|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. The Earth has started back down. The hack on the LPD there was 1 degree.
084:39:06|C|Lousma|Okay. One degree on the center of the Earth.
084:42:13|C|Lousma|That was a good TV show you put on the other night, Fred, during LM entry.
084:42:26|T|LMP|Yes. It would have been an even better one about 10 minutes later.
084:42:50|C|Lousma|Yes. Things sure turned to worms there in a hurry after that show.
084:43:12|T|LMP|Yes. You're right.
084:43:28|T|LMP|Okay. The center of the Moon now is about minus 2 degrees LPD.
084:43:35|C|Lousma|Minus 2 degrees, center of the Moon.
084:43:43|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 84 hours 44 minutes. The numbers that Fred Haise just read back down from the spacecraft refer to the position of the Moon, with respect to the landing point designator on the LM window. Haise reported earlier that the passive thermal control mode possibly was degrading a bit. He said that every time the spacecraft rotated, the Earth would appear to be a bit higher in the window and the Moon a bit lower. A short while after that he said that it may have corrected itself. That the Earth and the Moon appeared to be in about the right place. Mission Control asked him to try and give us the degree readings on the landing point designator for a couple of revolutions as the Earth and Moon rotated by and we'd keep a little closer watch on it and see if there was any significant change.
084:44:44|C|Lousma|Charlie said to say hello.
084:44:51|T|LMP|Who's that?
084:44:53|C|Lousma|Charlie.
084:44:58|T|LMP|Is he still around there?
084:45:16|T|LMP|Unless my watch is wrong, it says it's almost 2 a.m. back there.
084:45:22|C|Lousma|No. That's the bearded one.
084:45:29|T|LMP|Oh! Okay.
084:46:15|T|LMP|Hey, tell Charlie that I'll be back down there personally to thank him for this baby.
084:46:28|C|Lousma|Sure will. I did.
084:47:30|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 84 hours and 48 minutes. The Charlie who was referred to a few minutes ago in the conversation between Jack Lousma and Fred Haise was not Astronaut Charles Duke, but rather one Charlie Mars who looks after the Lunar Modules at Cape Kennedy prior to launch. At this time the Flight Plan that we have on one of our display boards here in Mission Control shows that Commander Jim Lovell and Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert have a little bit more than 3 hours remaining in their sleep period. The Flight Plan is relatively open. Also from 87 hours to 88 hours, which would indicate that there might be a better flexibility in extending that sleep period.
084:50:21|T|LMP|Okay. The Earth went by there, Jack, at LPD about 18 degrees.
084:50:28|C|Lousma|Roger. We copy 18 degrees for the center of the Earth.
084:53:56|T|LMP|Okay. The Moon - I'd estimate it up around minus - somewhere 17 to minus 20 degrees LPD.
084:54:07|C|Lousma|Okay. Moon's minus 17 to minus 20.
084:55:14|C|Lousma|How would you like to spend a week on an aircraft carrier getting back?
084:55:28|T|LMP|If I can get on an aircraft carrier, I don't care how long it takes, Jack.
084:56:28|C|Lousma|They're going to take you by helo to Samoa. You'll spend the night in Samoa, get on a 141, and be at Ellington shortly thereafter.
084:56:46|T|LMP|Okay. Kind of sounds like the original plans for the ...
084:57:24|C|Lousma|Had you worrying that you're going to spend the night on the ship, helo to Samoa and directly to Ellington.
084:57:35|T|LMP|Very good.
084:58:27|T|LMP|Boy, these thrusters are sure nice up here, Jack. ...
084:58:35|C|Lousma|Fred, I'm not reading you. Maybe we'd better wait until we change antennas or unless you can speak up a little louder.
084:58:43|T|LMP|How do you read now?
084:58:45|C|Lousma|Better.
084:58:49|T|LMP|Okay. The thrusters on quads 1 and 4 here ... and the ...discolouration on the tops or outside, and they hardly look like they've been fired. Really clean.
084:59:12|C|Lousma|Gee, I'm sorry, Fred. We're just not reading you right now. Maybe we'll have to wait a little bit.
084:59:20|T|LMP|Okay.
084:59:29|C|Lousma|Let's try it now. If you can speak up, the background noise has gone down a little bit.
084:59:37|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read now?
084:59:39|C|Lousma|A little better.
084:59:44|T|LMP|I was just commenting - I've been looking here at the thrusters on quads 1 and 4. Except for a slight discoloration on the outside of the barrel. The nozzles look like they hadn't ever been fired, - like they're brand new. A lack of anything on the interior on the upper nozzle ...
085:00:14|C|Lousma|You say the coloration of the thrusters appears they haven't been fired on quads 1 and 4?
085:00:24|T|LMP|I'm saying all of them look clean. I guess they've - these things fire so clean that they don't seem to ... at all. The heat maybe has discolored, slightly the copper, bronze, color of the nozzle itself. They've been fired because I watched them fire. Okay. The Earth's going by at an LPD of 42.
085:00:58|C|Lousma|Roger. Copy LPD 42. Is that affirm?
085:01:03|T|LMP|That's affirm.
085:01:17|C|Lousma|And, Fred, that may be why the comm is a little bit degraded, more background noise, because we're getting out of attitude a little bit there.
085:01:28|T|LMP|Roger.
085:03:38|T|LMP|How do you read on AFT OMNI, Jack?
085:03:43|C|Lousma|I'm reading you, Fred. I've got a lot of background noise. Looks like it might come and go with attitude.
085:03:54|T|LMP|Yes. I think that's probably - just looking through the Command Module at you now.
085:04:45|T|LMP|How do you read now, Jack?
085:04:47|C|Lousma|About the same, Fred.
085:04:52|T|LMP|Okay.
085:05:08|T|LMP|Okay. And the Moon just went by at about minus 14 degrees.
085:05:13|C|Lousma|Okay, the Moon at minus 14.
085:05:24|T|LMP|That - that's correct.
085:05:28|C|Lousma|Okay. Your landing in - your weather in the landing area, which is about 560 miles south of Samoa, is now predicted to be about 1500, scattered, high broken. Waves are going to be 5 feet, the winds are going to be 15 knots, visibility 10 miles, showers in less than 10 percent of the area, and you will be landing at 08:00 local, roughly.
085:06:04|T|LMP|Hey, that all sounds pretty good.
085:08:29|C|Lousma|Say, Fred, did you get the dope on the Saturn IV impact - S-IVB impact?
085:08:41|T|LMP|Yes. Just as we came around the corner, Vance told us that it hit - I don't recall the position now, but he said it had impacted and recorded it on the 12 seismometer.
085:09:04|C|Lousma|Yes. It impacted 74 nautical miles from the ALSEP and the passive seismic detected major seismic activity on all long period channels and this was - this activity was detected for 4 hours afterwards with decreasing amplitude. And the impact also was detected by the high-energy channels of the SIDE. The high-energy channels of the SIDE.
085:09:58|T|LMP|Yes. That ought to have them scratching their heads for a while.
085:10:41|P|PAO|This Apollo Control at 85 hours, 11 minutes. CapCom, Jack Lousma, has been keeping up a fairly steady stream of conversation with Fred Haise who has the watch aboard the Lunar Module. Commander Jim Lovell and Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert have been in a scheduled five hour rest period since a little after 82 hours ground elapse time - just about 3 hours now. At the present time Apollo 13 is about 20,400 nautical miles from the Moon, traveling at a speed of 4,396 feet per second.
085:11:42|T|LMP|Okay. The Earth LPD number that time was 32.
085:11:48|C|Lousma|Roger. Thirty-two.
085:14:57|T|LMP|How do you read now, Jack?
085:15:02|C|Lousma|I'm reading you, Fred. I've got a lot of background noise, though.
085:15:08|T|LMP|Jack, I can definitely tell we're moving away from the Moon, now. I got it all in the monocular at one time. We're right over the top of FPA 8 right now.
085:15:23|C|Lousma|You're right over the top of what?
085:15:24|T|LMP|On a point between it and Censorinus - FPA 8 and - the point halfway between there and Censorinus.
085:15:46|C|Lousma|Freddo, would say the checkpoint over which you're right now?
085:15:56|T|LMP|Okay. And incidentally, the LPD on the Moon was zero, so it's coming back down. The point looks like we're just about straight over is around Censorinus and the point between it and FPA 8.
085:16:19|C|Lousma|Okay.
085:22:07|T|LMP|Okay. And, Jack, the Earth LPD angle is 24 degrees.
085:22:14|C|Lousma|Roger. Earth at 24. And it looks like you're getting up to about 15 on the CO<sub>2</sub>, so we want you to select SECONDARY and swap out the primary cartridge. Over.
085:22:30|T|LMP|Okay. I'll select SECONDARY and swap out the primary cartridge.
085:22:53|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. And when you select - When you swap out the primary cartridge, don't reselect PRIMARY. Stay on SECONDARY until we use the secondary up. Over.
085:23:10|T|LMP|Okay. I'm changing out primary and - stay in SECONDARY until we use it up.
085:26:08|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 85 hours 26 minutes. In Mission Control our displays were very quick to show the effects of the change over from the primary lithium hydroxide canister to the fresh backup canister. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide which had been reading 14.9 millimeters of mercury has dropped to 4.6 at the present time and is continuing to go down from there.
085:29:43|T|LMP|And the change out is complete, Jack.
085:29:50|C|Lousma|Okay. Copy the changeout complete, and we're reading 4.5 on the CO<sub>2</sub> here.
085:30:01|T|LMP|Okay. I'm seeing a big lag, hope it goes down.
085:32:21|T|LMP|Okay. And the Earth LPD was 8 degrees.
085:32:25|C|Lousma|Did you - Did you say 8 degrees, Fred?
085:32:31|T|LMP|Affirmative.
085:32:34|C|Lousma|Okay.
085:36:52|T|LMP|Well, I missed the Moon on that one, Jack. But I would guess - estimating back a little bit, the LPD angle was somewhere around 42.
085:37:03|C|Lousma|Fred, I'm having a hard time reading you, but I think you're giving me an LPD angle.
085:37:12|T|LMP|Roger. That's it s Jack. The Moon is about 42.
085:37:16|C|Lousma|You say the Moon is at 22?
085:37:23|T|LMP|Four two, 42.
085:37:24|C|Lousma|Okay, 4 2. Thank you.
085:50:27|C|Lousma|How you doing there, Fred?
085:50:33|T|CDR|[unintelligible]
085:50:51|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. I can just barely hear you saying something in the background and I can't make out what it is.
085:51:02|T|CDR|Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
085:51:06|C|Lousma|Hello there, Aquarius. Go ahead.
085:51:11|T|CDR|Roger. And Fred is being relieved now. He's - went back to get some rest. This is Lovell here who's got the duty.
085:51:21|C|Lousma|Gee whiz. You got up kind of early, didn't you?
085:51:28|T|CDR|It's cold back there in the Command Module.
085:51:38|C|Lousma|Well, what we were really thinking about doing was letting you sleep a little bit longer because we figure you're pretty worn out.
085:51:55|T|CDR|Well, I'll go back and forth once in a while to get a ...
085:52:01|C|Lousma|Is Jack up there with you?
085:52:08|T|CDR|No, Jack's still sacked out.
085:52:41|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. We're kind of watching this PTC a little bit. Fred's been giving us a few LPD angles as we swang by the center of the Earth - center of the Moon. We noticed that the comm has been degrading just a little bit so you might have to talk up.
085:53:09|T|CDR|Roger. Understand.
085:53:11|C|Lousma|And we just went on to the secondary CO<sub>2</sub> canister. Fred swapped out the primary, but we want to stay on the secondary until it is all used up.
085:53:30|T|CDR|Okay. I'm going to try and use the ... of the partial pressure CO<sub>2</sub>.
085:53:42|C|Lousma|We're reading a partial pressure CO<sub>2</sub> of 4.2 millimeters. We're cleared to use the secondary until it reaches 15.
085:53:57|T|CDR|Okay. Sounds good.
085:56:27|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 85 hours 56 minutes. About 5 minutes - we'll standby for a call from the spacecraft.
085:58:21|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at about 85 hours 51 minutes we received a call from the spacecraft. Jim Lovell reported that he was now taking the watch duties while Fred Haise attempted to get some sleep. Jack Swigert apparently still resting in the Command Module. Lovell reported that it had gotten a bit chilly in the Command Module. At the present time Apollo 13 is 197,899 nautical miles from Earth and travelling at a speed of 3,740 feet per second, with respect to Earth.
086:01:47|C|Lousma|Aquarius, in comparing our initial estimates of water usage and electrical power usage, it appears that we're right on the money on water usage, and we're using a little less amperes than we had originally expected in our first analysis, so we're either right on the money or just a little bit ahead of the game in that regard.
086:02:18|T|CDR|Well, that sounds encouraging, Jack.
086:02:24|C|Lousma|And there are a few temperatures that we're watching for you. You have the heaters powered down. We're looking at them, and those include the PIPAs, the ASA, the quad temps, and your propellants, except for the DPS propellant.
086:02:49|T|CDR|Okay. I've got them here.
086:03:02|C|Lousma|We have, as you probably know, several groups working on procedures from here on out. We have a group working on midcourse corrections to determine a system, the attitudes, how to do it, alignment techniques, and so forth. We have a group working on the entry, including how and when we're going to activate the CSM. We have a group working on the CSM system status, and in a few hours - Later on tomorrow, from where we see it, we're going to go to some base configuration on the CSM and we're going to conduct a MAIN BUS B check. Right now the comm is kind of degrading, and I can't hear what you're about to say very well. But I just want to keep you advised as to how things are going here. And remember you've got duty on the antennas.
086:05:00|C|Lousma|Aquarius, are you reading Houston?
086:05:04|T|CDR|Roger ...
086:05:10|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. I can hear you talking but I can't tell what you're saying because you're way down in the background noise.
086:05:20|T|CDR|Okay. Can you hear Aquarius now? Over.
086:05:23|C|Lousma|Oh, yes. That's much better. Did you get my report on the various types of people and what they're doing around here?
086:05:30|T|CDR|Roger. Sounds like you had things well organized. You might also consider what kind of a stowage configuration ... and what we can leave behind in Aquarius.
086:05:50|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. I didn't catch that suggestion on account of the background noise; may be we can pass it on when it gets more favorable.
086:06:07|T|CDR|I'm thinking in terms of stowage. Whether we would leave the suits, things like the Hycon camera in Aquarius, prior to departure.
086:06:26|C|Lousma|Okay. I heard you say something about using the Hycon camera in Aquarius.
086:06:36|T|CDR|Negative, Jack. I'm thinking of the entry stowage ... Whether we should - what we should leave behind in Aquarius. Leave the suits behind; leaving such big items as the Hycon cameras in Aquarius. Over.
086:06:53|C|Lousma|Oh, understand. You're thinking about stowage. What'll we leave behind in Aquarius when we fall back into Odyssey. Is that right?
086:07:04|T|CDR|That's affirmative.
086:07:06|C|Lousma|Okay. We've people working on that, too.
086:07:26|C|Lousma|And we presently are tracking you at 22,500 miles from the Moon, moving out at 4,400 feet a second.
086:07:43|T|CDR|Aquarius. Roger.
086:09:25|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 86 hours 9 minutes. Communications continue to be rather noisy due in part to the fact that the Lunar Module has drifted somewhat out of it's passive thermal control attitude and we don't have the best angle on the antennas for reception from the Lunar Module. During that last series of conversations with Jim Lovell and CAPCOM Jack Lousma, advised him of the status of all consumables on the spacecraft. He reported that the consumables were either ahead of the predicted values or at least right on them. And, Lovell replied, "That is encouraging". Lovell also asks that here on the ground we look at the stowage in the Command Module and Lunar Module, particularly with an eye to what things can be left behind in the Lunar Module when the crew moves back into the Command Module for Earth entry.
086:10:36|C|Lousma|And, Jim, earlier in the evening, we thought there was a misunderstanding about the amount of potable water you can drink, but we want to advise you that you can drink as much water as you want to. There's 38 pounds in the potable tank, and that's about all you'll need. The doctors suggest you drink as much fruit juices as you want, too.
086:11:02|T|CDR|Roger, Jack.
086:13:52|C|Lousma|Jim, earlier in the evening, Freddo reported some venting out of window number 1 in the Command Module. He also reported a piece of loose metal about 4 inches square, silver, floating by, and one thing we were trying to establish is whether or not this is a new venting or whether this is part of the residual venting of our original problem. Do you have any more words or comments? And one thing he was doing was taking some photographs and we authorized photographs, targets of opportunity, using the lunar-surface camera number 1, and use the setting of 1/250 of a second, and not knowing precisely what f-stop to use, we suggested taking three of each, using settings of f:4, f:5.6, and f:8. Over.
086:14:57|T|CDR|Roger, Jack. The venting appears to be a new venting. ... see out there now ... burn ... I reported earlier, I also spotted the large piece go by and prior to our PC+2 burn, there appeared to be a piece of wrapping The venting you see now is much greater than during the -  when we went into the dark mode, you could easily distinguish stars and didn't have the bright articles and bright objects, and I also have the camera here to take photographs ... debris.
086:16:09|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. Once again I hear you talking back there but I can only pick out a few words; maybe we'll have a better time.
086:16:54|C|Lousma|Aquarius, we're trying to improve our communications. Could you turn the BIOMED off and give us a voice check, please?
086:17:09|T|CDR|Voice check follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; voice check out.
086:17:18|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. That seemed to be better.
086:31:02|C|Lousma|How are you doing there, Aquarius?
086:31:08|T|CDR|We're doing good, Jack.
086:31:10|C|Lousma|Okay. Sometime when you get two guys available there and you could construct one of these lithium hydroxide rigs, I'd like to have you get the materials together, and we'll go through the steps together.
086:31:28|T|CDR|Okay. Sounds good. And how do you read me now?
086:31:33|C|Lousma|Well, there is a lot of background noise, and sometimes it is worse than others and right now I hear you better than I have in the past.
086:31:45|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. I'm kind of curious the amount of perturbations our PTC attitude is taking. I notice that we are getting off attitude, and I'm just kind of curious how far we can let this go.
086:32:03|C|Lousma|We were tracking the attitudes with Fred earlier and it looked like what we were doing was oscillating about some point, but coming back. Are you detecting some kind of divergence now?
086:32:21|T|CDR|Not too much. I notice that it's different than when I went to sleep. We are more at an angle now with the terminator of the Earth, so when we started out, we were just about parallel with the terminator, and now we are canted off somewhat. I haven't seen any trends, though, of going back and forth.
086:33:08|C|Lousma|And, Jim, our current plan is to not correct the PTC. We're going to take whatever we get and live with it. And we can kind of keep track of what's going on a little better if when you swing past the Earth and swing past the center of the Moon, if you could read off the LPD angles for the center of the Earth and the center of the Moon. Over.
086:33:34|T|CDR|Roger. Will do, Jack. And I'm looking into the AOT now through the right - No, the number 4 detent, and we are venting something back there; I can see particles coming off past the Command Module. What it is, I don't knew.
086:33:59|C|Lousma|Okay. Can you identify the quadrant?
086:34:18|T|CDR|Well, I'm looking through the right rear reticle now of the AOT, and when I was back in the Command Module, I could see it out of the CM 1 window. The particles are rather small, but they are coming out with some force. That's probably what is disturbing our PTC attitude.
086:34:50|C|Lousma|Yes, that sounds quite probable, Jim. That's about the same report we got from Fred, but we haven't been able to identify what they might be and probably won't be able to until we crank up the CSM. If there's any change in that status, why, we just want to keep advised of it.
086:35:11|T|CDR|Roger. Understand.
086:35:28|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 86 hours 35 minutes. That conversation was a bit difficult to copy entirely. Lovell reported that he had noticed some small particles coming out of the Command Module apparently coming out of the Command Module--the Service Module, to be more specific. He said he did not know what the particles were, but that they were small and coming out with some force, and he suggested that this venting was probably disturbing the PTC attitude of the spacecraft.
086:36:09|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, we are setting a pretty good vector on you now. And it looks like you're a little bit outside of the corridor. We're looking at a 7 foot per second midcourse at 104 hours. We are going to come up with an entry interface minus 8 pad to use in the event of a loss of comm situation
086:36:39|T|CDR|Roger. Understand, and I hope you have that procedure for attitude.
086:36:48|C|Lousma|We are ginning up a procedure for attitude for you, Jim. For the no-comm case, it may be a little different than what the guys working on the procedures come up with for the burn at 104 hours.
086:37:09|T|CDR|Roger.
086:37:36|C|Lousma|What I'm saying, Jim, is the guys who are working on this attitude situation for the burns haven't made their final conclusions yet, but in the interim period, we want to come up with something you can use, in the event that you lose comm.
086:37:53|T|CDR|I concur.
086:40:54|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. The Earth is going through the 10-degree line or angle of the LPD.
086:41:02|C|Lousma|Okay, We copied 10 degrees. Is that Earth or Moon, Jim?
086:41:08|T|CDR|That is Earth.
086:41:10|C|Lousma|Okay. Earth 10 degrees. Thank you.
086:45:52|T|CDR|And, Houston ... As we move to go. Oh! The Moon to pass an angle of about 24 degrees on the LPD.
086:46:03|C|Lousma|Okay. We read 24, Jim.
086:46:09|T|CDR|That's affirm.
086:46:15|P|PAO|Jim Lovell continuing to report the relative positions of the Earth and the Moon as they rotate by his LM window. He is comparing the position with a grid marked on the Lunar Module window, the landing point designator, which is a calibrated grid, and by noting the shift in the position of both the Earth and the Moon as the spacecraft rotates we're able to get at least a rough idea of how much the spacecraft attitude is deviating from the original passive thermal control attitude. Now the combined CSM/LM stack is rotating at a rate of about one revolution every 11 minutes at this time. Repeating again, both Lovell and Fred Haise have reported seeing particles coming from the area of the Service Module, apparently venting. Fred Haise was asked at the time he reported it if he felt it was continued venting from the original event which lost the power and oxygen from the Service Module or a new event, and he did not know. A short while ago Jim Lovell reported seeing a similar phenomena. He described it as small particles coming out of the spacecraft from what appeared to be the Service Module. He said that they were coming out with some force and mentioned that this was probably disturbing the passive thermal control attitude. We're watching this with some interest in Mission Control, but with no concern at this point. The primary concern, as I mentioned, is with what effect it would have on the passive thermal control attitude. However, this is not a significant problem. The effect on the passive thermal control attitude is relatively small. The flight dynamics officer has also reported that there is relatively little effect on the position of the vehicle as reflected in the ground tracking of the spacecraft, which would lead us to believe that the venting is relatively small.
086:53:46|T|CDR|Jack, the LPD on the Moon now is 22 degrees.
086:53:51|C|Lousma|Okay. I'm reading you better, Jim. Say again, please.
086:53:57|T|CDR|Roger. The LPD now on the Moon is 22 degrees. I missed the Earth last time. I'll get it this time.
086:54:04|C|Lousma|Okay. Twenty-two degrees, and looks like we've come up with a procedure for the attitude control on the upcoming burns. Probably the ones that we'll use from here on out.
086:54:23|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. Stand by 1.
086:54:30|C|Lousma|It's going to be a few minutes before I'm ready to read it up to you.
086:54:39|T|CDR|Okay.
086:59:23|T|CDR|Jack, on the Earth of the LPD angles is about a minus 2 degrees and just slightly above the top line.
086:59:36|C|Lousma|Okay. Just went by minus 2 degrees. Is that on the Earth?
086:59:43|T|CDR|That's the Earth. Now, I don't know whether we're oscillating back and forth or not, Jack, or whether it's a continual motion. We'll have to see here.
086:59:52|C|Lousma|Roger.
087:02:56|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. The Moon now has an LPD angle of 10 degrees.
087:03:01|C|Lousma|Roger. The Moon at 10 degrees.
087:04:24|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. Just as kind of a lead-in to this procedure that we're going to use for the midcourse burn, I'd like to say that we're going to use AGS and it's going to be a manual burn. The attitude will be controlled manually; the start/stop on the engine will be controlled manually. So we have a pretty good vector on you now, and it turns out you're coming in a little bit too shallow. So what that means is we're going to make our burn to come in a little more steeply, and we're going to be coming in around the dark side of the Earth. Therefore, to come in more steep, our thrust should be in the direction of the Sun. Does that all make sense to you?
087:05:29|T|CDR|I think so. We're going to use AGS for a burn monitor. The burns are going to be manual, and they're going to be started manually and stopped manually.
087:05:46|C|Lousma|Okay. And your reentry is around the dark side of the Earth, and since we're coming in shallow, we're going to have to burn toward the Sun to make it steeper. Do you follow that?
087:06:05|T|CDR|That's affirm. Especially these burns will be perpendicular to our flight path and to the Sun giving a steeper entry angle.
087:06:28|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. I heard you say perpendicular to your flight path, which is affirmative, and I didn't get the rest of your statement.
087:06:46|T|CDR|I understand the technique, Jack. We're burning to the Sun to steepen our entry angle, and it will be perpendicular to our flight path for corridor control.
087:07:01|C|Lousma|Okay. That's affirmative. So, in general terms, what we're going to have to do is to power up the AGS and bring up the AGS eight-ball, and then to set up your attitude, put the COAS in the front window, and guidance control will be in AGS, of course. But manually orient the spacecraft to place the center of the Earth directly out the Z-axis. Then rotate about the Z-axis to place the points of the crescent on the Y-axis of the COAS. And this will have your plus X-axis in the direction of the Sun as we discussed before. So the crescent will be up with the point down. Copy that?
087:08:19|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. We'll have to go over that again. The COAS will be in the front window; we'll place the Earth in the center of the COAS, and, let's see, the terminator on the Earth right now is parallel to the LPD which is about parallel to our X-axis. And we'll have to rotate about 90 degrees to get our X-axis pointing toward the Sun.
087:09:14|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. So we want to get the Y-axis of the spacecraft parallel to the terminator by putting the points of the crescent on the Y-axis.
087:09:35|T|CDR|Roger. Understand.
087:09:57|T|CDR|Essentially, Jack, when I stop the spacecraft looking at - at the Earth, I'm going to have to roll - in LM terms, roll the spacecraft 90 degrees to get the top of the Earth parallel to the Y-axis.
087:10:45|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jim. You're going to have to roll 90 degrees to point your plus X-axis at the Sun and put the crescent - the points of the crescent on the Y-axis. The points of the crescent on the Y-axis with the COAS pointed at the center of the Earth will take care of your yaw and your pitch.
087:11:16|T|CDR|Roger.
087:11:38|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. After you get that orientation to come in a little more steeply, we perform an AGS body-axis align which is at 400 plus 5 on the DEDA. If the AGS ball is up at this time, the AGS ball will go to 000. We can talk more about control modes later, but we'd recommend doing this, of course, in AGS ATTITUDE HOLD - ATTITUDE HOLD. Put your YAW to MODE CONTROL and leave PITCH and ROLL in PULSE, therefore, controlling your attitude with the TTCA. We don't want to use the gimbal, so have ENGINE GIMBAL OFF. We'll make these burns at 10-percent thrust. We'll use a manual start and stop. For ullage, we'll use the PLUS-X TRANSLATIONAL button, and ullage will be for 10 seconds. Over.
087:13:06|T|CDR|Okay. I understand what you're saying, but you'll have to repeat it here.
087:13:15|C|Lousma|Okay. We'll perform the burn in GUIDANCE CONTROL to AGS. And MODE CONTROL to ATTITUDE HOLD. Your ATTITUDE CONTROL switches will be ROLL to PULSE, PITCH to PULSE, and YAW to MODE CONTROL. So the AGS will control your yaw and you will use the TTCA to control pitch and roll. ENGINE GIMBAL OFF; 10-percent thrust. Start and stop manual. For ullage, use the plus-X translational button; 10 seconds ullage. Over.
087:14:45|T|CDR|Okay. For the burn there will be go to GUIDANCE CONTROL AGS, MODE CONTROL ATT HOLD, ATTITUDE CONTROL switches will be ROLL PULSE, PITCH PULSE, YAW MODE CONTROL. We'll use TTCA control for pitch and roll. ENGINE GIMBAL will be OFF; we'll be using 10-percent thrust; we'll start and stop manually, the ... ten seconds ullage will be a PLUS-X TRANSLATIONAL button. And also our thrust will still be, but before that we are going to do an AGS align, to get the ball 000.
087:15:26|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jim. After you get oriented in the attitude you want to burn in, do an AGS align which is - an AGS body-axis align which is 400 plus 5. When you get ENTER, this will bring ball up to 000, and I want to confirm that you - that you said ENGINE GIMBAL OFF. O-F-F. Over.
087:15:52|T|CDR|Roger. Confirm that ENGINE GIMBAL will be off.
087:16:11|T|CDR|And, Jack, how long do you estimate the length of the burns will be?
087:16:17|C|Lousma|Okay. The length of the burns are going to be probably less than a minute. And we want you to have cut-off based on time. So we will give you a burn time. And I have a P30 maneuver pad for midcourse-7 in the event that we lose comm if you are ready to copy.
087:16:56|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. Ready to copy.
087:17:06|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. P30 LM maneuver pad: the purpose is midcourse-7. NOUN 33 is 134:59:42.98. NOUN 81 is N/A. HA is N/A. HP is plus 0020.5. DELTA-VR is 0019.3. Burn time, 0:39; 008, 000; the rest is N/A; thrust will be at 10 percent. Read back.
087:18:19|T|CDR|All right. This is midcourse-7 corridor control, and it's in case we lose comm: 134:59:42.98; NOUN 81 is N/A; 42, N/A; plus 0020.5; 0019.3. Burn time, 0:39; 008, 000. All the rest is N/A: thrust 10 percent.
087:19:04|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. That's a good readback, and in the event of lost comm, use the procedures that I gave you. It may be that between now and tomorrow these procedures will change a little bit, so we'll go with what we've got now, and stand by for something better if it comes. Over.
087:19:28|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. I'm looking at your burn pad and I see that we're burning a total DELTA-V will be 19.3 feet per second.
087:19:44|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. We verify 19.3 feet per second for 39 seconds.
087:20:51|T|CDR|The old midcourse technique sounds like something that we came up with on Apollo 8.
087:21:00|C|Lousma|Yes, everybody wondered if you would remember that; by golly, you did.
087:21:17|C|Lousma|Hey, Jim, I got a little bit more information - maneuver PAD, I got LAT/LONG range to go, VERB 10 and GET; if you got a place to copy that down, I'll give it to you for EMS.
087:21:38|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by.
087:22:12|T|CDR|Go ahead.
087:22:17|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. I just have the last three blocks. NOUN 61: latitude, minus 021.62; longitude, minus 165.37; range to go, 1162.9; VERB 10:36291: GET of .05g is 142:41:30; read back.
087:22:59|T|CDR|Okay, Jack, I didn't get the latitude, but the longitude is minus 165.67; range to go, 11629; velocity 36291; 142:41:30.
087:23:24|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. The latitude is minus 021.62; I have a correction on the longitude - minus 165.37. Go ahead.
087:23:46|T|CDR|Roger, Jack. The latitude is minus 21.62; longitude is minus 165.37, and this goes in conjunction with that midcourse 7 pad you gave us.
087:24:02|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. That means no maneuvers between now and midcourse 7. And this is a horizontal in-plane burn, plus X, toward the Sun, 19.3 feet per second.
087:24:52|T|CDR|Roger, understand.
087:26:31|C|Lousma|And, Jim, on the - Setting up the AGS, right after you do the 400 plus 5, you should do a 400 plus all balls. And one other point we want to clarify is that we know that you're sure that this burn will be made with the plus X-axis pointing at the Sun to make the entry angle steeper. You got it?
087:27:10|T|CDR|That's right, Jack. What I'm going to do is - We'll stop with the Earth in the commander's window, the COAS down, and then I'm going to maneuver the spacecraft so that I have the lighted portion of the Earth at the top of the window; that is, the cusp will be along the plus-Y of the spacecraft and the top of the window - of the rendezvous window, I should be looking into the Sun. That means I'll be burning towards the Sun and steepening the angle.
087:28:03|C|Lousma|That's affirm, Jim. I - You got the attitude right, and did you copy about doing a 400 plus all balls after - you do the 400 plus 5? That is, a 400 plus 5 and a 400 plus all zeros back to back.
087:28:22|T|CDR|Roger. I have copied that.
087:29:06|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 87 hours 29 minutes. The conversation which we just had with Jim Lovell related to a - what is called a pad data for entry interface minus 8 hours. This is a more or less routine bit of information which is passed to the spacecraft at various portions of the mission the purpose of which is to give them the information they would need to perform a critical maneuver were they out of communications with Mission Control for any reason. In this particular case, this would be the burn that would put them in the proper position for reentry, if at some point, prior to entry they had lost communications with Mission Control. Normally, of course, the final midcourse corrections will be made with the information passed from the ground including the spacecraft attitudes. Without communications to the spacecraft, it would be necessary for them to determine their own attitude.
087:30:15|T|CDR|Jack - this is Aquarius. I'm not too sure how long or with what force the venting is going to do to our trajectory. However, you might keep a ... on that. It may have been going on for some time.
087:30:47|C|Lousma|Roger, Jim. We've been taking a look at it. We haven't been able to detect it on the Doppler, however.
087:30:56|T|CDR|Roger.
087:30:56|P|PAO|Lovell's question there pertained to the  -
087:31:08|C|Lousma|But we think it's pretty small.
087:31:13|P|PAO|Lovell's question pertained to the venting, which he reported a short while ago. He was asking if the vent was having effect on the trajectory and suggesting that we monitor it to determine how significant effect the venting from the Service Module might have on the spacecraft trajectory. As we mentioned before, we've been tracking and Flight Dynamics Officer reported that he could detect no change in the trajectory which could be attributed to a venting to that reason we would suspect that the effect of the particles coming out of the Service Module is minimal and from that we would also conclude that the vent is quite small.
087:34:05|T|CDR|And, Houston, Aquarius.
087:34:09|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
087:34:14|T|CDR|Jack, would you give me a time hack on an even GET so I can start my watch.
087:34:24|C|Lousma|Okay. Coming up on 87 hours and 35 minutes, we will be there in 30 seconds. Set it for 87:35.
087:34:37|T|CDR|Just give me a hack at 88 hours.
087:34:43|C|Lousma|Okay. I'll give you a hack at 88 hours. That'll be another 25 minutes.
087:34:51|T|CDR|All right. Thanks.
087:36:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 87 hours, 36 minutes. The series of numbers passed up to the spacecraft several minutes ago, as we were saying, related to the pad information which the crew would use in the event they were out of communications with Mission Control because of some unforeseen failure, and were not able to receive from the ground the information needed to do a final midcourse correction prior to entry. In this case, Lovell would be required to get the spacecraft in the proper attitude and perform final midcourse correction with numbers supplied previously, and those numbers were just passed up to him. The procedure for putting the spacecraft in the proper attitude would be to use the Sun and the Earth as reference points, and then once the spacecraft was in the proper attitude he would perform the maneuver as indicated on the entry interface minus 8-hour pad, which we just read up to him. This of course, would be a back-up procedure. The normal procedure would be to use the onboard guidance equipment and numbers supplied prior to the burn from the ground, and only in the event of some unforeseen communications failure would this backup procedure be used.
087:37:44|P|PAO|At the present time Apollo 13 is 194,269 nautical miles from the Earth and traveling at a velocity of 3,771 feet per second. Coming up at 90 hours, 24 minutes, and 40 seconds, the spacecraft will cross into what is known as the Earth's sphere of influence. At this point in Mission Control we'll begin calculating the spacecraft altitudes and velocities for trajectory purposes with respect to the Earth rather than with respect to the Moon, and we'll also at that point begin to see the velocity climb as a result of the ever increasing of Earth's gravity on the spacecraft. Up until that point, the trajectory displays would indicate the spacecraft slowing down under the dominant affect of the Lunar gravity. The height from the Earth at the point of sphere crossing would be 188,067 nautical miles, and the distance from the Moon at that time would be 33,821 nautical miles. One other bit of information from the Flight Dynamics Officer is that the mid point in terms of distance will occur at 119 hours, 44 minutes, 33 seconds; at that point the spacecraft will be 110,730 nautical miles from Earth, and from the Moon. At 87 hours, 39 minutes; this is Mission Control, Houston.
087:41:53|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
087:41:56|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
087:42:00|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. Let's just talk over how I'm going to get to the attitude and then do the burn. What I'm talking about is the control techniques. The way it looks now I'll try to stop the spacecraft in yaw with the Earth out my window. Then we'll be in GUIDANCE or we'll be AGS CONTROL; we'll be in - yaw will be in MODE CONTROL. Then we'll be using the TTCAs to control the pitch and then control the roll. I don't see another way we can control the combination that we have here without using the TTCAs. Then we will also use the TTCA during engine burn. Do you people concur with that technique?
087:43:05|C|Lousma|Jim, that sounds like the one that is best to use to me. Let me talk it over with the rest of the guys here, and we'll advise you.
087:43:16|T|CDR|Okay.
087:46:43|C|Lousma|Jim, in that control mode, that sounds like the best way to go. The only thing you'll have to do is to get ATTITUDE HOLD in the AGS, and so before you start to maneuver, you'll have to bring the AGS up, and get a 400 plus all zeros in there, and then AGS will respond in yaw when you go to MODE CONTROL. That is, AGS will control your yaw in MODE CONTROL and your pitch and roll can be taken care of in PULSE with a TTCA. After you get in attitude, then, you'll have to re-do an AGS body axis align which is 400 plus 5, then go back to 400 plus all zeros again.
087:47:36|T|CDR|Right, Jack. That was my next question. I don't want to align the AGS ball 000 until I am in position, so we use that as a primary attitude burn monitor device.
087:48:05|C|Lousma|And, Jim, you can do a 400 plus all zeros any time you want to; that just tells the AGS that you want it to control your attitude should you go to ATTITUDE HOLD in MODE CONTROL.
087:48:19|T|CDR|Roger. I understand, but after we get to the attitude, we'll do a 400 plus 5 to get the AGS align ball, and then we'll do a 400 plus zero.
087:48:31|C|Lousma|Affirmative.
087:49:14|C|Lousma|Another thing, Jim, is while you're maneuvering to that attitude using AGS to control your yaw, if you find out enroute to that attitude that you didn't quite have the yaw where you wanted it to be, you can use your ACA and tweak up the yaw, and your AGS needles go right back to zero because you zero the attitude errors.
087:49:46|T|CDR|Roger. Sounds good.
087:50:48|C|Lousma|Jim, you'll be splashing down about 560 miles southeast of Samoa at about 0800 local time. The weather forecast for the area is good; 1500, scattered, high broken, 10-mile visibility. The seas will be 5-foot waves, 15 knots, and you'll be going to Samoa by boat and/or aircraft. You'll spend either the night on the boat or in Samoa and return to Ellington by 141 on Saturday, the following day.
087:51:37|T|CDR|Roger. Would you tell the people of the LRL to turn it off.
087:51:46|C|Lousma|Oh, no. We're going to do the whole bit.
087:53:21|T|CDR|And don't forget my hack at 88 hours, Jack.
087:53:24|C|Lousma|Say again, please, Aquarius.
087:53:30|T|CDR|Don't forget my time hack at 88 hours.
087:53:33|C|Lousma|Roger. That will be in about 6-1/2 more minutes.
087:53:42|T|CDR|Roger.
087:56:20|C|Lousma|Jim, we got a couple of news-type items. President Nixon has chosen a judge from Minnesota for the position of Associate Justice in the Supreme Court. A bill giving federal employees a 6-percent pay raise passed the House and went to the President; includes the military. And the air traffic controllers returned to work.
087:56:57|T|CDR|Well, that's great. You think they'll consider this for flight pay?
087:57:33|C|Lousma|Well, we might be able to work out some arrangement.
087:58:35|T|CDR|Standing by for the 88-hour time hack.
087:58:43|C|Lousma|Say again, Jim.
087:58:47|T|CDR|Standing by for the 88-hour time hack.
087:58:52|C|Lousma|Okay. We got a minute to go.
087:59:54|C|Lousma|Okay. Coming up on the 88-hour mark. I'll give, you a 2-second delay. Stand by to mark.
087:59:59|C|Lousma|MARK.
088:00:05|T|CDR|I got it.
088:10:10|C|Lousma|How are you doing, Jim?
088:10:16|T|CDR|Pretty good, Jack. Say, you might have the people look at our DPS burn card to see what changes have to be made on it for this burn.
088:10:30|C|Lousma|Heard you say look at the DPS burn; you'll have to say what about it again, please.
088:10:39|T|CDR|Roger, Jack. You might take a look at our DPS burn card, our checklist card that we have in the LM, and see what changes might have to be put in that checklist.
088:10:50|C|Lousma|Okay, DPS burn card.
088:14:24|P|PAO|Here's some words on that vent that the crew report  -
088:25:18|C|Lousma|How're you doing there, Jim?
088:25:23|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. It appears that we're going - funny diversion here, the PTC attitude in - in pitch. I'm going to do a LPD check now, but the last time the Moon went around, it was above - way away above the LPD angle and I see the Earth coming around now which is going to be pretty low. They oscillate back and forth, but each time they seem to get a little farther away from the center line. You might think of some procedure to reestablish PTC, if it's necessary.
088:26:02|C|Lousma|Okay.
088:27:09|C|Lousma|Jim, the only way we know of getting the as good or a better PTC than you've got right now is to crank up the G & N and we - We don't want to do that. So our plan is to just take whatever we get out of this, and later on, it may turn out by the time you get to burn attitude, you'll be right where you want to be.
088:27:37|T|CDR|Okay. We'll just leave her go.
088:30:36|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
088:30:38|C|Lousma|Go ahead.
088:30:42|T|CDR|What's our course of action to set up PTC after this midcourse at 107?
088:30:51|C|Lousma|We thought you'd ask that.
088:31:06|C|Lousma|The only thing we can try to do, Jim, is to set the thing up manually and see what happens. There must be a better answer than that.
088:31:17|T|CDR|Okay.
088:31:18|C|Lousma|-  and one course of action is to omit the midcourse and make a total midcourse, say, about 8 hours before entry. We haven't decided yet.
088:31:37|C|Lousma|Right now we're talking about a 7 foot per second midcourse at 104 hours. And extrapolate that down to about 8 hours before entry. We gave you a pad for that - that's about, only 19 feet per second, so if it doesn't change too much - and we can get all kinds of DPS.
088:32:01|T|CDR|Understand. Sure like to keep this vehicle in the corridor though.
088:55:07|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
088:55:10|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
088:55:16|T|CDR|Can you think of any normal venting phenomena that might occur like maybe - a hydrogen tank that's over-pressurized relieving in the window?
088:55:31|C|Lousma|Yes, we thought of that, Jim.
088:55:52|C|Lousma|That is one possibility that we have thought of, Jim, because - We heated up that tank, and we haven't been using any hydrogen and, therefore, it could be venting in the overboard relief.
088:56:10|T|CDR|Right. The only other thing I can think of when I look at it through the AOT is - it didn't appear to be coming from one spot, but that's the only difference although I can't see where it is coming from because it's beyond the curvature of the Command Module. But, it appears like it might be coming from more than this one spot.
088:56:34|C|Lousma|Okay. Thank you. We hope that when we crank up the Command Module tomorrow that we'll be able to - or later on today - that we will be able to identify more closely what it's been coming from. But, the guidance guys say that they haven't been able to see the results of any venting in their data and it would take a very, very small amount to perturb their data.
088:57:02|T|CDR|Well, that's a note of encouragement.
088:58:57|C|Lousma|You got a Chinese band going up there?
088:59:04|T|CDR|Oh, sorry. I forgot all about hot mike.
088:59:10|C|Lousma|Sounds pretty good.
088:59:58|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 89 hours. A short while ago, just moments ago, you heard a bit of music on the air to ground line coming in over the noise. Jack Swigert, the Capsule Communicator, or rather, Jack Lousma, the Capsule Communicator checked with Jim Lovell and Jim confirmed that the music was coming down from the spacecraft. At the present time the status aboard the spacecraft is - as best we can tell, is that Lovell is the only one of the 3 crewmen who is up and about. Jack Swigert has been resting since about 82 hours Ground Elapsed Time, and Fred Haise began his rest period at 86 hours Ground Elapsed Time. Lovell rested from about 82 hours until about 86 hours, now when he changed positions with Fred Haise taking over the watch. At the present time Apollo 13 is 191,187 nautical miles from Earth, and traveling at a speed with respect to Earth of 3,804 feet per second. We expect to continue having quite a bit of noise on the communication line communication circuit with the spacecraft - partially due to the fact that the spacecraft, in its passive thermal control attitude, is deviating somewhat from this attitude and we do not have the optimum positions on our antennas on the spacecraft omni antennas for strongest reception. This situation corrects itself somewhat as the spacecraft continues to rotate at the rate of 1 revolution every 11 minutes and periodically we get a combination of antenna positions on the spacecraft with respect to the antennas on ground that improves our communications situation. We do not intend to attempt to modify the spacecraft attitude with the primary guidance system powered down at this time, the feeling is that the attitude we would get by trying to reestablish the passive thermal control mode manually would probably not be as good as the one that weve got right now. So the plan is to live with the communications problem and to expect that we will have periods during which it will not be possible to get usable communications because of the background noise. At Mission Control at this time, we are beginning the shift change, the handover, a number of flight controllers have come in from the - for the succeeding shift; Flight Director Glynn Lunney and his Black team of flight controllers will be replacing Flight Director Milton Windler and the Maroon team. And that shift handover is scheduled to occur at about 7 AM Central Standard Time, or about 45 minutes from now. At 89 hours three minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.
089:05:51|C|Lousma|Jim, we've had you scheduled for an eat period about an hour ago. I suppose you've taken care of that. The other thing is we're kind of interested in knowing how long you're going to be at stick there, or if you're going to go back to bed or what?
089:06:12|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. We're - We're going to set up a regular watch and sleep period here. Fred was up for a long time, so I got up a little bit early to relieve him. Jack and Fred are now asleep, so I'm going to let them sleep as long as they can, and then we'll have an eat period and then I'll go back to bed for a bit. And we'll separate the schedule.
089:06:40|C|Lousma|Okay. We're right at the point now where, according to the Flight Plan that we had made up for you, that you would have all finished eating and you and Jack would have the duty while Fred went to sleep. So, essentially, according to the plan we've got, you got up about 3 or 4 hours early. And - The next time that we have that as a rest period for you is at 96 hours, which is 7 hours from now, and an hour before that, say at 95 hours, all three of you would eat, and then you and Jack would hit the sack again and Fred would have the duty until 102 hours. We'd be glad to take care of this work-rest cycle for you.
089:07:40|T|CDR|Okay. That's good. Let me - Let me wait until they get up, or at least Jack gets up. He should be getting up before Fred. And we'll try to get back on the schedule. I hate to wake everybody up right now though, if they're sleeping.
089:07:54|C|Lousma|Okay. Your choice on that. As soon as Jack gets up, I'd suggest we go ahead and break up these lithium hydroxide canisters and make a couple of them. Jack could work on that. It's going to take four sets of hands, I think.
089:08:15|T|CDR|Okay. We'll make that the project, getting the lithium hydroxide canister squared away.
089:58:23|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
089:58:29|T|CDR|Go, ahead, Houston.
089:58:31|C|Kerwin|Hi, Jim. We've got a site handover in about 2 minutes, and we'll have a temporary loss of comm. You don't need to switch antennas. Over.
089:58:42|T|CDR|Okay; fine.
090:00:56|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston through Madrid for a comm check. How do you read?
090:01:02|T|CDR|Loud and clear, Joe. How me?
090:01:05|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim.
090:06:38|T|CDR|... asleep?
090:06:46|T|CDR|I ... how about Fred? May have a procedure for making up the lithium hydroxide ...
090:07:16|T|CDR|We're on secondary. We'll let it go to 15. Why don't you get on a headset and copy down a procedure for ... cartridges?
090:07:37|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
090:07:41|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
090:07:46|T|CDR|Okay. Jack's up with me now and you all get a procedure for making these lithium hydroxide devices, and soon as he gets on his helmet, he'll be ready to copy, and then he'll get started making one.
090:08:05|C|Kerwin|Roger that, Jim. Understand  -
090:08:07|T|CDR|On second thought  -
090:08:09|C|Kerwin|Go ahead.
090:08:13|T|CDR|I'll give Jack the headset for a while and he'll copy down your instructions.
090:08:30|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. I didn't copy your second thought. Over.
090:08:38|T|CDR|I'll give Jack the headset and let him copy the instruction.
090:08:43|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. The way I thought it might be best to do it would be to have you gather the equirment and let us talk you through your procedure while you do it. Now, maybe you could give Jack the headset and - and - get the equipment together, and we'll talk you through the procedure. I think it'll be a little easier to do that way than if you tried to copy it all down - and then go do it.
090:09:11|T|CDR|Okay. Do you have any equipment listed? I'll just get it and I just tell him and I can just sit here where I am.
090:09:17|C|Kerwin|Okay. I think the equipment you'll need will be two Command Module lithium hydroxide canisters, a roll of the gray tape, the two LCGs, because we're going to use the bags from the LCGs, and one - one LM cue card - one of those cardboard cue cards which you will cut off about an inch and a half out from the rings. Now, I think that's all we'll need. Over.
090:10:03|T|CDR|Okay. Standby one. Okay, Houston.
090:10:23|T|CDR|Hello, Houston.
090:10:25|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, Jim.
090:10:28|T|CDR|Okay. ... two lithium hydroxide canisters, one roll of that special gray tape, two LCGs which we're going to use the bags from, one LM cue card and ...
090:10:53|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's affirmative, Jim. If you'll just cut the cue card, which is a handy piece of stiff paper the right size, about an inch and a half from the rings. Just cut off the ring holes, in other words, and you'll have a card about 11 inches long and probably 6 inches wide, something like that.
090:11:19|T|CDR|Okay, fine. I'll have Jack gather up the stuff.
090:11:22|C|Kerwin|Okay.
090:11:28|T|CDR|... that roll of gray tape.
090:11:34|T|CDR|... back there ... Okay. ... LM ... and plastic and plastic bags.
090:11:48|T|CDR|Yes. Bring it down here. One LM cue card. I get that.
090:20:14|T|CDR|Okay. I got the canisters now.
090:20:24|T|CDR|...
090:20:38|T|CMP|...?
090:21:16|T|CDR|Yes ...
090:21:26|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
090:21:32|C|Kerwin|Yes. Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
090:21:37|T|CDR|We have gathered the materials, and I can put Jack on the headset and he can copy the instructions for these, do you see any need for - or should I copy it to give them to him, or do you think they're too detailed?
090:21:55|C|Kerwin|Why don't you put him on the headsets, Jim, and I'll read it out to him.
090:22:02|T|CDR|Okay.
090:22:30|T|CMP|Okay, Joe, I'm on.
090:22:33|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. Did anybody ever tell you that you got a 60-day extension on your income tax. Over.
090:22:42|T|CMP|Yes. I think - I think somebody said that when you are out of your country, you get a 60-day extension.
090:22:50|C|Kerwin|Okay; right. Okay. I'm ready to start into the procedure. When you answer me back, speak up - speak up into the microphone, because our downlink is pretty noisy. The first thing we want you to do, and we'll do this on one canister, and then let you go ahead and repeat it on the second. So take one of the LCGs and cut off the outer bag. By cutting along one the heat seals; do it carefully and close to the heat seal, because we may have to use the outer bag if we damage the inner bag. So go ahead and do that, and then we'll do the next step.
090:23:37|T|CMP|Okay. Take an LCG, cut the outer bag by the heat seal. Be careful not to damage the inner bag. Right?
090:23:46|C|Kerwin|Right. Just cut along one side.
090:24:50|T|CMP|Hey, Houston, Odyssey - or Aquarius. We've done that.
090:24:55|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. Now - now remove the inner bag from the outer bag, and cut the inner bag, also, along one of the heat seals down one side.
090:25:15|T|CMP|Okay. Remove the inner bag from the outer bag, cut the inner bag along the heat seal along one side.
090:25:22|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's correct. Do that, and report.
090:26:20|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. We've got that done.
090:26:22|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. Now you can put the LCG itself; that is, take it out of the inner bag, put it in the outer bag, and stow it some place; we recommend U-1, but you can stow it wherever it's convenient.
090:26:40|T|CMP|Jim, get the outer bag ... and stow it back in U-1.
090:26:48|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. We've got that.
090:26:50|C|Kerwin|Okay. Now pick up one of the lithium hydroxide canisters, and let me describe which end is which. It's approximately square on one - one of the vented flat ends, has the strap, and that end we call the top, the end opposite we call the bottom. Is that clear? Over.
090:27:21|T|CMP|Right.
090:27:34|T|CMP|Okay. I've got it, Joe.
090:27:37|C|Kerwin|Okay. Now then, we're - we want you to take the tape and cut out two pieces about 3 feet long, or a good arm's length, and what you're - what we want you to do with them is to make two belts around the sides of the canister, one belt near the top and one belt near the bottom, with the sticky side out; wrap it around, sticky side out, as tight as possible. It'll probably take both of you to get it nice and snug. Over.
090:30:01|T|CMP|Okay, now  -
090:30:15|T|CMP|Okay. Now we've got to make the belt real taut here.
090:30:23|T|CDR|How's that?
090:30:35|T|CMP|Real tight. And then we get it round the bottom.
090:33:13|T|CMP|Okay, Joe.
090:33:18|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. Did you have  -
090:33:19|T|CMP|-  Hey, Houston, are you reading Aquarius?
090:33:24|C|Kerwin|Jack  -
090:33:25|T|CMP|-  We've got the two belts around the top and the one around the bottom all done.
090:33:30|C|Kerwin|Okay, fine. The next step now is to anchor that tape, and the way we want you to do that is to cut about a 2-foot length off the roll and then tear it lengthwise so that you have two strips about 2 feet long and about a half an inch wide. And you'll wrap those around the canister at right angles, more or less, to the tape that you've got so that it goes across the top and across the bottom; and when it goes across the top and the bottom, put it so that it's outboard of the center hole and try to get it over one of the ridges between the screens, so that it won't block the flow. Is that clear? Over.
090:34:15|T|CMP|Yes, Joe. Very good.
090:34:17|C|Kerwin|Okay. Press on.
090:34:22|T|CMP|Okay. I've got a cut things up here and we'll tear it lengthwise in half and I'm going to go around right here at this ridge all the way around at right angles and anchor this tape here.
090:34:43|T|CMP|Yes.
090:34:46|T|CMP|Joe, just to clarify that, sticky end down. Right? On the tape that I am putting on now?
090:34:54|C|Kerwin|I didn't quite copy that, Jack. Say again.
090:34:58|T|CMP|Okay. That will be the sticky end down on the container, right?
090:35:05|C|Kerwin|Oh, that's correct. I forgot to say that. That's right.
090:35:33|T|CMP|If you hold that one right here, if I can set it.
090:37:28|T|CMP|Okay, Joe; Aquarius. We've got that done.
090:37:32|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. The next step is to get the EVA cue card and use it to form an arch over the top of the canister; just tuck one short end under one ridge on the top the other one against the ridge on the other side so that it forms a rounded arch over the top of the canister. You see, Jack, what we're going to do is slip the bag over this whole assembly and the cue card will serve to keep the bag from being sucked down against the screens. Over.
090:38:10|T|CMP|Okay. I got the idea.
090:38:13|C|Kerwin|Okay. And when you've done that, to hold the arch in place, just run a strip of tape across the side of the - that is, across the top of the arch, and anchor it down to the sticky strips along each side.
090:38:31|T|CMP|Okay. I got the idea. Okay. Let me just repeat it here. Take a cue card, form an arch over the top, sticking it under the side here. When we're through, run a piece of tape from the sides across the top of that to anchor to the other side.
090:38:51|C|Kerwin|That's correct.
090:38:56|T|CMP|Okay. In worked.
090:39:00|T|CMP|The top. ... Across the top. ... anchors ...
090:39:18|T|CMP|Looks like you're going to have to cut the cue card slightly.
090:39:32|T|CMP|Doesn't have to be really ... all the way across. You can just take the scissors and cut off the edge here. The only thing this does, Jim, is prevent this from being sucked down into the container.
090:40:28|T|CMP|Still going to need some more tape. Cut off the end. Think I'll whack off about the same.
090:43:34|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. We've got that arch built, and it's all taped in securely.
090:43:41|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. The next step is to stop up the bypass hole, which is the hole in the center of the bottom of the canister; we want to stop that up because we don't want to bypass the flow; and I forgot to tell you to get something to stick in that hole. We recommend that you either use a wetwipe, or cut off a piece of sock and stuff it in there, or you could probably even crumble up some tape and use that. Over.
090:44:13|T|CMP|Okay. We'll start plugging up the bypass hole.
090:44:17|C|Kerwin|Okay.
090:44:18|T|CMP|Plug that hole. We can either - we can put some either - Let's cut a piece of your towel there.
090:44:27|C|Kerwin|Sounds good.
090:47:14|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We have the bypass hole all plugged up.
090:47:21|C|Kerwin|Okay, Aquarius. The next step is take the inner LCG bag that you cut open, and slip it over the top of the canister, when you do that, orient it so that the ears of the bag, that is, the corners should stick out on the closed end - are oriented along the open ends of the arch, because we're going to snip one of those corners to stick the hose in. Pull it down until it fits snugly over the arch. Over.
090:47:56|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. Slip the bag over the canister so that the arch is at the bottom of the bag and that the ears are along oriented along, let's see - I guess it would be - would be at the sides of the arch.
090:48:19|C|Kerwin|Depends on what you mean by sides - over the - the open ends of the arch.
090:48:26|T|CMP|Right, the open ends of the arch.
090:48:28|C|Kerwin|Okay.
090:49:17|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. We've got that done.
090:49:20|C|Kerwin|Okay. Now press the bag against the sticky belts that we put on the sides of the canister. If there is any excess material, just kind of pleat it, so that it makes a fairly tight seal, and then take another 3-foot strip of sticky tape and wrap it around the outside of the bag opposite the bottom - the bottom sticky belt - to make a nice tight seal.
090:49:50|T|CMP|Okay, in work. Okay. Now we want two strips around here to make a tight seal.
090:52:38|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. We've got the canister inside the bag, two strips around the sides of the bag, real tight, and both sealed.
090:52:47|C|Kerwin|Okay; real fine. Now there's probably a couple of inches of excess bag sticking out around the bottom of the canister. To prevent this from sucking in against the bottom screen, we'd like you to trim it off with the scissors, and when you've done that, we'd like you to cut two more strips of tape about 12 inches long or so, cut the - tear them lengthwise to get four pieces 12 inches long and 1/2-inch wide, and then use those four strips to secure the bag by passing the strips from the sides of the canister outside the bag around the bottom of the canister and back up the other side, and when you do this, just as you did on the top, make them go outward of the hole and in between the screens. Over.
090:53:42|T|CMP|Okay. You want me to trim the excess material that's sticking off here; trim it at the edge of that canister? Or do you want any excess left over?
090:53:52|C|Kerwin|No, you don't need to have any excess. Just trim it approximately level.
090:53:59|T|CMP|Okay. Let's do that first.
090:54:01|C|Kerwin|Okay.
090:54:58|T|CMP|Okay. Now, Joe, you want to cut four strips, 12 inches long each, 1/2-inch in diameter. Tape that along the outsides of the bag across the ribs.
090:55:15|C|Kerwin|That's correct, Jack. That's just for additional security on the bag. When you get those done, you'll have - You'll have two strips going one way, and the other two will be perpendicular to them.
090:57:58|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We've got the four strips in place.
090:58:03|C|Kerwin|Okay. We're in business now with the bag, and the next step to perform is to get ready to put the red suit hose, either the commander's or the LMP's because we're - we're going to want you to have both of these made up eventually, into the top of the - of the bag, and to do that you, first of all, have to assure that the - that the red hose is separated from the blue hose. I don't know whether this has been done already, but if it hasn't, what you have to do is cut the outer Beta-cloth sheath down the full length of the - of the hoses and then also cut the rubber ties that secure the two hoses together, and the hoses should come apart and the comm cable should - should come off. Over.
090:59:04|T|CMP|Okay. Take the - I'm going to want to separate the red hose from the blue hose by cutting this Beta-cloth sheath. Okay. That's in work.
090:59:15|C|Kerwin|Okay.
091:00:52|T|CMP|Okay, Houston, Aquarius. I have the LMP's red hose separated from the others.
091:01:00|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real fine. Now the next step is to cut a diagonal hole in one ear of the - of the plastic bag near the arch. You can pick either one and cut about, a 1-1/2 or 2 inch diagonal hole, big enough to slip the red hose through. And when you've done that, you'll just slip the red hose through so that it goes about to the center of the canister. It's - it's - It's not critical except that the opening should be down, and then tape the bag to the hose where it goes in so that it's nice and snug. Over
091:01:40|T|CMP|Okay. Copy that. We want a 1-1/2 inch hole right here at this ear, and put the hose in here, end down and toward the canister and then we tape the seal around here.
091:02:09|T|CMP|Let's try it. We can always make it bigger if we have to. Freds, red hose. ... down ... the center of the arch.
091:02:52|T|CMP|Got to - Got to come in towards the center, all the way to the center. No, no. ... down ...
091:06:17|T|CMP|Yes. I can't get, those big knobs.
091:08:39|T|CMP|... All we have to do is ... seal around here ... we got a tight fit. ...
091:10:16|T|CMP|There it is right there.
091:10:18|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
091:10:20|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
091:10:26|T|CMP|Okay. Our do-it-yourself lithium hydroxide canister change is complete. Joe, the only thing different is that our arch on this piece of cardboard is not big enough to position the red hose with the inlet down, and the inlet - the inlet to - to the red hose is lying on its side, but I think it'll still work.
091:10:53|C|Kerwin|Ok my, Jack. I concur. I think it'll work, too. There's one step that I omitted, which you can do now quite conveniently, and it's this. Where you stuff the towel in the bypass hole on the bottom, we recommend that you cut a few short pieces of tape and just tape that over so it doesn't fall out. Over.
091:11:17|T|CMP|Okay. Will do. Backup. I've got one more little thing to do, and that's ... seal that top.
091:12:28|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. That's done.
091:12:30|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. Now the remaining steps are simply suit-loop configuration steps to get this thing into full operation, and our ECS people want to hold off on that until the canister you're working on gets to 7.6 millimeters of mercury, which will probably be another 45 minutes or an hour - it - We're reading 4.7 now. So what we'd like you to do in the interim is to set up the second Command Module canister the same way you just did the first one, using the commander's hose, and get that all set and probably about that time it'll be time to - to switch over. For your information, when you've got that done and if you've had your breakfast and so on, the next thing I've got for you is a switch-configuration list for the Command Module, which will represent the - the power down, square-1 starting configuration for all our - our preentry checks. Over.
091:13:39|T|CMP|Okay, will do. We'll start setting up the commander's hose configuration the same as the LMP's hose. And I'll get - instead of - I guess you want me to use my launch switch - launch checklist which I'd ...
091:14:00|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative, Jack. What we have done is marked up the lift-off configuration checklist, and we'll run through it whenever you get around to it.
091:14:11|T|CMP|And, I assume that ...
091:14:38|T|CMP|What I'd better do is before I put this thing back in operation, they're going to complete that other canister first. I don't know. It should be in operation now. ... and they said other things
091:15:05|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
091:15:07|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go.
091:15:12|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. Should this canister be in operation now because it's already mounted on the hose?
091:15:17|C|Kerwin|Well, yes. We haven't completely configured the suit loop to get full flow through there, and it's okay the way it is. What I recommend you do with the commander's hose is get the bag all ready, but not stick the hose in until we call you on it. Okay.
091:15:39|T|CMP|Okay. Will do.
091:16:45|T|CMP|It won't go round?
091:17:04|T|CMP|Yes. Or else a strip of tape.
091:17:55|T|CMP|Okay, Jim. We've got to start setting up the commander's. ... like this one ...
091:18:22|T|CMP|You can get one of the cards, and I'll start cutting the LCG.
091:20:33|T|CMP|Yes. ... show. How about this hole, because I've got two in my ...
091:20:52|T|CMP|Yes. Here, we'll store them back where I got it.
091:21:06|C|Stafford|Hello, Aquarius; Houston.
091:21:10|T|CMP|Go ahead.
091:21:11|C|Stafford|Roger, Jack; Tom here. Just thought I would pass on to you and Jim that got a little data priority going today, and going to convene to CPCB and we'll have you all kinds of good procedures for later on. Over.
091:21:24|T|CMP|Okay. Thanks, Tom. You guys are really working overtime.
091:21:29|C|Stafford|We're getting a little coordination down here.
091:21:41|C|Stafford|Aquarius, Houston. You might pass on to Jim, he had such a long day yesterday, we thought we were going to have to play him some guitar music to get him to sleep last night. Over.
091:21:52|T|CMP|That's exactly what he did. Tom said you had such a long day yesterday, he thought he was going to have to play some guitar music to get you to sleep.
091:22:13|T|CMP|Okay. Let's get, this tape around the outside.
091:25:47|T|CMP|Kind of looks like the Earth has gotten kind of angled a little bit, but it's, for as many hours as ..., I think it's been great. You know how to do this? How? Put it on the terminator.
091:31:54|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 91 hours, 31 minutes Ground elapsed time. In the last hour or so, Spacecraft communicator Joe Kerwin has passed up to the crew some items of shade tree engineering on how to build the lithium hydroxide canister container which uses the suit system - suit circuit return hoses in the Lunar Module, and these two canisters will scrub the atmosphere, removing carbon dioxide. This is primarily a backup to look forward to the time when the time has run out on the canisters in the Lunar Module. Present position now as shown by the space digital display which at this moment are on a Moon reference frame, showing 36,688 nautical miles from the Moon, this computes out in Earth distance to about 184,830 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity relative to the Moon 4,284 feet per second. Current usage electrical current still hovering around 12 to 14 amps. At this time, Haise  apparently is still sleeping. All consumable usage is at either on or below the predicted levels and at 91 hours, 33 minutes, Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control, standing by.
091:33:55|T|CMP|Okay. Now we got to get two strips ...seal ... tight.
091:36:52|T|CMP|Tom said the CPCB is getting together today ...
091:37:01|T|CMP|... he's never been through a Command Module activation.
091:37:22|T|CMP|That looks good. Now we got trim that extra.
091:39:30|T|CMP|Now, I don't really - Part of that is - See, Jim, I have the same problem that you have. I can't control pitch very well with my RHC - I have to use the THC and that was the control problem. No, I don't think that there's any control problem. I don't know why, because - Well, you have to ... you still have barber pole on the - on the secondary propellant valves.
091:43:16|T|CMP|... Oh, wait a minute; I'm sorry I didn't see it. ...
091:43:20|T|CMP|...
091:43:30|T|CMP|... (laughter) ...
091:45:30|T|CMP|I'll tell you, why don't you put - under your restraining cable; just stow it under your restraining cable there. And that will keep, then, until we're ready for them.
091:45:48|T|CMP|Can I have my juice?
091:45:53|T|CMP|... there's an orange in yours. ... drink.
091:46:06|T|CMP|Yes, I've got to get the launch checklist. And we're going to go over initial switch configuration. And get all those ...
091:46:45|T|CMP|I kind of have an idea that as soon as we hit darkness, we'll be doing a P51, P52. Hope we're going to be ...
091:49:30|T|CMP|When you get through, you could get me that launch checklist up in R-3 ... back of R-3.
091:53:05|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
091:53:11|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
091:53:15|T|CMP|Okay, Joe, I'm ready to start on that Command Module switch configuration. I'm on page L 1-1.
091:53:24|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. Understand you are ready for the switch configuration checklist. And I have in front of me the lift-off configuration, page L 1-1. Are you with me? Over.
091:53:39|T|CMP|I'm right with you.
091:53:41|C|Kerwin|Okay. I'll read these in bunches of three or four at a time, some of them are the same, some of them are changed, and you can read them back every few steps. EMS FUNCTION to OFF; EMS MODE to STANDBY, no change; GTA, off, down, no change; and GTA cover, secure, no change. Over.
091:54:08|T|CMP|Okay. EMS FUNCTION, OFF, MODE, STANDBY, GTA, off; GTA cover secure.
091:54:15|C|Kerwin|Roger. CMC ATTITUDE to IMU, no change; FDAI scale, 5/5, no change; FDAI SELECT number 1; and FDAI SOURCE, GDC. Over.
091:54:36|T|CMP|Okay. FDA - CMC ATTITUDE, IMU; FDAI scale, 5/5; FDAI, select 1; SOURCE GDC. Hey, what you do is just read the ones that have the changes, Joe, and I'll read back to you, everything, where you stop.
091:54:54|C|Kerwin|Okay; fine. The next one that changes is three down, where we go, "MAN ATTITUDE PITCH to RATE COMMAND." Over.
091:55:09|T|CMP|Go ahead.
091:55:15|C|Kerwin|Okay. The next one, two, three, four are unchanged. And then we want TRANSLATION CONTROLLER POWER to OFF, ROTATION CONTROL POWER NORMAL, two, to OFF; and ROTATION CONTROL POWER DIRECT, two, to OFF. Over.
091:55:36|T|CMP|Okay.
091:55:39|C|Kerwin|Okay. The next two are unchanged. And we want the 3 BMAG switches in RATE 2. Over.
091:55:55|T|CMP|Okay.
091:55:57|C|Kerwin|Okay.  The next one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight are unchanged, and we get down to the ELS AUTO switch which we want in MANUAL. Over.

092:34:30|C|Kerwin|Okay, and that's all for page 1-10. You want to read any of that back? I think you've got it all.
092:34:39|T|CMP|No, I think I've got it all.
092:34:41|C|Kerwin|Okay. Let's go to page 1-11. On panel 276, no change; on panel 278, we want all circuit breakers open; no exceptions. Over.
092:34:57|T|CMP|Panel 278, all open.
092:35:00|C|Kerwin|Roger. Now we'll skip all the way down to panel 306 where we want the MISSION TIMER to STOP and the EVENT TIMER to STOP. Over.
092:35:23|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 306, MISSION TIMER, STOP; and EVENT TIMER, STOP.
092:35:28|C|Kerwin|Okay. And those are all the changes on 1-11, Jack.
092:35:35|T|CMP|Okay. Ready for 1-12.
092:35:37|C|Kerwin|Okay. On page 1-12, panel 325, we want both CABIN PRESSURE RELIEF valves to NORMAL. Over.
092:35:49|T|CMP|Okay. Both to NORMAL.
092:35:52|C|Kerwin|Okay. On panel 326, we want the REPRESS PACKAGE valves to OFF; the SM O<sub>2</sub> SUPPLY valves to OFF; the SURGE TANK O<sub>2</sub> valve to OFF. Over.
092:36:10|T|CMP|Okay. REPRESS, SERVICE MODULE O<sub>2</sub> SUPPLY, SURGE TANK O<sub>2</sub>, three of them, to OFF.
092:36:19|C|Kerwin|Roger. You did include the REPRESS PACKAGE there. Okay, GLYCOL RESERVOIR IN valve to CLOSED. BYPASS to OPEN, and OUT valve to CLOSED. Over.
092:36:37|T|CMP|Okay. GLYCOL RESERVOIR IN valve CLOSED; BYPASS valve OPEN; and RESERVOIR OUT valve CLOSED.
092:36:51|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative. Panel 350, no change. Panel 351, MAIN REGULATOR valves, two, to CLOSED, and the H<sub>2</sub>O/GLYCOL TANK PRESSURE REGULATOR valve, OFF, and RELIEF valve, OFF. Over.
092:37:17|T|CMP|Okay. MAIN REG valve, two, to CLOSED. WATER/GLYCOL TANK PRESSURE REG and RELIEF valves, both OFF.
092:37:27|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's affirm. Those are the last changes on 1-12. Let's go to 1-13.
092:37:35|T|CMP|Okay. Ready to copy.
092:37:37|C|Kerwin|Okay. Go down to panel 380, O<sub>2</sub> DEMAND REG valve, OFF, and SUIT CIRCUIT RETURN VALVE, pulled to OPEN. Over.
092:37:56|T|CMP|Okay, both O<sub>2</sub> DEMAND - DEMAND REG valves are OFF and SUIT CIRCUIT RETURN VALVE pulled OPEN.
092:38:05|C|Kerwin|That's correct. Go to panel 382. The first one, two, three, four are unchanged. We want SEC EVAP H<sub>2</sub>O CONTROL valve OFF, and PRIM EVAP H<sub>2</sub>O CONTROL valve to OFF. Those both are both counterclockwise. Over.
092:38:35|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Reading back 382, SECONDARY EVAPORATOR H<sub>2</sub>O CONTROL valve's OFF, and PRIMARY EVAPORATOR H<sub>2</sub>O CONTROL valve, OFF.
092:38:49|C|Kerwin|That's correct. Those are the only changes on 1-13, and there are no changes on 1-14, and you've got it all, Jack. Over.
092:39:01|T|CMP|Okay. Real good, Joe. No further configures for that panel.
092:39:08|C|Kerwin|Okay. You can get those configures when you can. And the next order of business I've got for you is a procedure to verify that MAIN BUS B is good. And a little after that, we'll want to read up to you, for your future information, a procedure for transferring LM power to the Command Module. Over.
092:39:33|T|CMP|Okay. That sounds good. You want to get this PLSS configuration done first before you give those other procedures, huh?
092:39:44|C|Kerwin|Yes, I think so. Stand by 1 second and I'll see if FLIGHT has any words for us before you start that.
092:40:22|C|Kerwin|Jack, Houston. Over.
092:40:26|T|CMP|Go ahead.
092:40:27|C|Kerwin|Okay, we don't have anything for you. Our only concern is that you'll wake up somebody; is there anybody sleeping right now?
092:40:37|T|CMP|No. We're all sitting here eating. I'm just going to get a bite to eat. Then I'll write down that switch configuration, or I'll copy the procedure now, if you want.
092:40:48|C|Kerwin|Yes, okay. Understand they are all up. Did you say you wanted to copy the other procedure now? Over.
092:40:57|T|CMP|I can if you want. It's your choice.
092:41:00|C|Kerwin|I'd rather you went ahead with the switch configuration, Jack.
092:41:06|T|CMP|Okay, let's do that and then I'll be back with you.
092:41:10|C|Kerwin|Okay. See you later. And tell Jim that Deke wants him to go to bed.
092:41:21|T|CMP|Okay. I'll tell him that right now.
092:41:24|C|Kerwin|Okay.
092:41:25|T|CMP|I'll tell you, I'll get my switch set done first before I eat so I won't disturb Jim then.
092:41:31|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
092:41:36|T|CMP|Go ahead.
092:41:37|C|Kerwin|Stand by 1 minute, Jack, before you go in there. FLIGHT has got one other item for you.
092:41:48|T|CMP|Deke wants you to go to bed.
092:42:16|T|CMP|Right now.
092:42:30|T|CMP|... like that ... I got up about 1 hour ... back in the command module ... go upstairs ...
092:43:31|T|CMP|You know what I thought - I think what we saw venting was the result of our DELTA-Vs stirring up things, popping the relief valve. Yes. We don't see anything venting now. Do we?
092:44:03|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. We are standing by.
092:44:12|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
092:44:16|T|CMP|Okay, Joe.
092:44:18|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. You can go ahead and set up that switch configuration. What we are discussing is having you activate the Main Bus Tie motor switches a little later on simply to verify that they will be okay, because the batteries are probably getting a little bit cool. But we'll be back to you with a procedure and discussion about that after you get the switch configuration set up. Over.
092:44:47|T|CMP|Okay, I'm going to go get the switch configuration done now before Jim goes to bed so I don't disturb him.
092:44:55|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real fine.
092:45:00|T|CMP|Jim thinks Deke sounds like Frank Borman on Apollo 8.
092:45:04|C|Kerwin|(Laughter) Okay.
092:45:06|C|Slayton|Sorry about that.
092:45:11|T|CMP|I'm going to give the comm to Freddo, now.
092:45:59|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
092:46:02|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
092:46:07|T|CDR|Okay, before I hit the sack, Joe, I just want to make sure - How are you still planning an MCC at 107 and what's the latest thought?
092:46:16|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We are still gathering our thoughts on the MCC, but some of the considerations go like this: FIDO tells us that we can do that correction probably as late as 118 hours, with no significant DELTA-V penalty, and with plenty of tracking thereafter to make sure that we've done the right thing, and to set you up for a late MCC if we need it, which we probably wouldn't. We are happy with the PTC mode that you are in now, and, although we are working up a - an AGS PTC mode to use after the midcourse correction, we'd kind of like you to stay in this PTC for a while because it is doing good. We are looking at the weather in the landing area. We don't think we'll have a problem but we are checking it real close, and if there is any changing that we want to do, we want to get it into this midcourse correction. And for reasons like that, we are - we are considering possibly delaying the midcourse correction from 104 hours to some time between there and 118. We'd like to know what you think about it. Over.
092:47:33|T|CDR|We have no druthers. As long as we do the midcourse and there is plenty of tracking thereafter to correct for another midcourse; that's my only concern.
092:47:44|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. Roger that. And based on FIDO's input that he'd like to do it not later than 24 hours before EI, we will be doing it prior to 118 hours.
092:47:57|T|CDR|Okay.
092:48:38|T|LMP|Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
092:48:43|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go.
092:48:48|T|LMP|Question, Joe. Jim has been talking to me about how we are going to do this midcourse, and awhile back when we went through this power up, we had pulled the STAB/CONTROL ASA breaker. I was wondering - we lost the heaters in the ASA - I was wondering how it looked? What kind of shape it's going to be in?
092:49:18|C|Kerwin|Okay. Stand by on that one, Fred.
092:49:24|T|LMP|Okay.
092:49:48|C|Kerwin|Fred, Houston.
092:49:52|T|LMP|Go ahead.
092:49:53|C|Kerwin|Roger. I am told that we'd see 38 degrees in that package, and it'll be okay for the burn. We're massaging the detail procedures for this burn at this time and we expect to have a real clean setup to you in plenty of time.
092:50:12|T|LMP|Okay, very good.
092:50:30|T|LMP|And I don't know if Jack passed it on to you, but Jack and I just finished logging about 6 hours sleep, each.
092:50:51|C|Kerwin|Roger, Fred. Copy that. Is it a little chilly up there?
092:50:58|T|LMP|Yes. We made the mistake of putting up the window shades, which we won't do again; and with this powered-down mode, we're not generating much internally, and it really did get chilly.
092:51:13|C|Kerwin|Yes. I guess you'll have to generate your own heat in there for a while.
092:51:19|C|Kerwin|Deke says unstow the Exer-Genie.
092:51:26|T|LMP|Okay.
092:53:46|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We are anticipating the start of the change of shift press conference within the next few moments in the Building 1 auditorium (main auditorium). The participants will be the Maroon team Flight Director Milt Windler and retrofire officer from that team Tom Weichel. Changes in procedure - the spacecraft power up and checklist being passed up by Joe Kerwin went to the crew. We've had no bio-medical telemetry in the last several hours from the crew and there's been no report of any medication having been taken by the crew of Apollo 13. Distance now from Earth, 182,390 nautical miles, velocity 3,920 feet per second. Total spacecraft weight 87,942 pounds at 92 hours 54 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and standing by this is Apollo Control.
092:57:47|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
092:57:52|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.
092:57:54|C|Kerwin|Fred, just wanted to let you know in advance that we're coming up on the redline CO<sub>2</sub> value for the secondary canister, and we expect to get there in something like a half hour, at which time we'll be asking you to switch over to the Command Module canisters. I have the rest of that procedure ready and I just wanted to warn you a little bit in advance. Over.
092:58:20|T|LMP|Okay. And I've got a question for you, Joe.
092:58:25|C|Kerwin|Go ahead.
092:58:31|T|LMP|Okay. The - I need to find out if the condensate container that we were going to use to strain some water in on the lunar surface - is that container also completely airtight? Okay to use it to put fluid in through here in zero g?
092:59:01|C|Kerwin|Fred, I didn't copy what you wanted to use it for. Over.
092:59:09|T|LMP|Okay, ...
092:59:21|C|Kerwin|Fred, Houston. We'll have to stand by for 1 minute. We are in a noisy state of comm.
092:59:29|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read now, Joe?
092:59:31|C|Kerwin|Oh, that's much better. Go ahead.
092:59:36|T|LMP|Okay. I was just going to say we haven't had an overboard waste water dump since clear back around the other side of the Moon. About this time, we're running out of the bags we've got on board here.
093:00:03|C|Kerwin|Okay. I'm - I'm stupid this morning, Fred. I'm not quite sure what you are getting at.
093:00:14|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. We need some place to put the urine.
093:00:18|C|Kerwin|Okay. It sounds to me as if the suggested receptacle is perfectly satisfactory. Do you think you can use it in its present configuration?
093:00:34|T|LMP|Oh, yes. We got all the innerconnects - hookups we need, but I wasn't sure if that gadget was devised solely with the 1/6g environment in mind, and whether it might leak somehow in zero g.
093:00:50|C|Kerwin|I'll have them verify that, but off the top of my head, I'm sure it's going to be all right. We'll check it, Fred.
093:00:59|T|LMP|Okay.
093:05:22|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read, Joe?
093:11:53|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
093:12:01|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
093:12:06|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. One thing I've noticed, that a couple of circuits there now - the false stars - that we see, the number of them, is markedly decreased, from when I went upstairs to bed and, apparently, that added venting we had out of the Service Module was some overboard relief valve, maybe letting go, because it appears to have stopped now.
093:12:38|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. Copy that. Thank you.
093:23:14|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
093:23:17|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
093:23:24|T|LMP|What do you read down there for partial pressure CO<sub>2</sub>?
093:23:29|C|Kerwin|Oh, let's see. We're reading 6.6 right now, Fred. What do you read?
093:23:38|T|LMP|I'm reading about 12.5. I guess we've got a gage problem there maybe? I did just get a Master Alarm and no caution light; we kind of figured that's what it was, with CO<sub>2</sub> approaching its limit. Maybe it didn't quite come out here.
093:23:59|C|Kerwin|Okay. Let me get a Go, and I think it's time for us to go ahead and put these other canisters on. Stand by 1.
093:24:08|T|LMP|Okay. We went to 15 on the primary last night before I changed it and  -
093:24:16|C|Kerwin|Roger that, Fred. We wanted to  -
093:24:18|T|LMP|-  I don't have a steady - I don't have a steady ECS light on at this time, Joe, so it must have just been a momentary.
093:24:28|C|Kerwin|Okay. We know when you went to 15 last night on primary. We want to switch out today at 7.6. Let me check and see if we're ready.
093:24:41|T|LMP|Okay.
093:25:13|T|LMP|Yes. That's what it is, Joe. I've got something going on this alarm ... ECS light.
093:25:24|C|Kerwin|Fred, Houston. The comm isn't too sharp and I didn't copy.
093:26:34|C|Kerwin|Okay, Aquarius; Houston  -
093:26:37|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?
093:26:38|C|Kerwin|-  Why don't you try it now? You're loud and clear now, Fred.
093:26:42|T|LMP|Okay. I was just - I'm getting Master Alarms every few seconds and I am catching a glimmer now of the ECS light. For the time being, I have MASTER ALarm breaker - or CB open. Okay, now we got the ECS light on steady.
093:27:07|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that. You have the Master Alarm, with the ECS light. We are ready to go ahead and get you on the Command Module canisters. And as the first step, I'd like to know whether you've inserted the commander's red hose to the second canister bag. Over.
093:27:29|T|LMP|Okay. Yes. Sure enough; the commander's red hose is inserted into the canister bag.
093:27:39|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. The next thing I'd like you to do is to take some more gray tape and tape over half the outlet area of each of the blue nozzles; the commander's and the LMP's. The reason we're doing this is we're going to be running this loop through the secondary LiOH canister hole with the canister removed, and we don't have the flow restriction we need to keep the separator from overspeeding. Over.
093:28:11|T|LMP|Okay. Yes, that's right. So we want to tape over half of the - both the blue and the red commander hoses. Is that right?
093:28:22|C|Kerwin|Negative, Fred. That's half of the Commander's's blue hose and half of the LMP's blue hose - the outlet hoses.
093:28:31|T|LMP|Oh, okay. I'll tape over half of each of the outlets. Stand by.
093:28:37|C|Kerwin|Okay.
093:31:40|T|LMP|Okay. I'm going to turn off one suit flow valve at a time while I am doing the taping, Joe.
093:31:51|C|Kerwin|Say again, please, Fred.
093:31:56|T|LMP|Okay, while I'm doing the taping, I'll have that particular suit flow valve in the suit DISCONNECT position momentarily.
093:32:03|C|Kerwin|Okay. Fine.
093:43:46|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read now, Joe?
093:43:49|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. Reasonable comm. Are you ready for the next step? Over.
093:43:57|T|LMP|Okay. One correction - the red hose that's connected up right now to the lithium cartridge in the LMP's - rather than the commanders.
093:44:17|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. Understand only the LMP's red hose is actually plugged into the canister bag. In that case, we would like you to follow the procedure for inserting the other red hose in the other canister bag as follows: you cut a diagonal hole in one corner of the bag. Look at the other bag and see how it was done. Stick the hose in about 6 inches. Try to get the outlet nozzle down if you can, or else sideways, and then just tape up the hose to the bag to make a nice tight seal. Over.
093:45:02|T|LMP|Okay. Jack's back in here. I guess he can do that. Stand by.
093:45:08|C|Kerwin|Okay.
093:45:58|T|LMP|How do you read, Joe?
093:46:00|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. Is that done? Over.
093:46:06|T|LMP|No. That's still in works. I just wanted to comment you might pass on to Steve Grega, we thank you a lot for those rendezvous procedures. They went to making up these little boxes.
093:46:29|C|Kerwin|Okay. We appreciate your appreciating it. We're just having a ball down here working on all kinds of new procedures, Fred. The CPCB is in session, and we expect to have your entry procedures out here by Saturday or Sunday at the very latest.
093:46:50|T|LMP|Saturday or Sunday?
093:46:52|C|Kerwin|At the very latest!
093:47:14|T|LMP|Take your time, Jack.
093:47:36|T|LMP|Why don't you run that other hose back up in the tunnel so Jim can get some air.
093:47:54|T|LMP|Yes. I got it.
093:49:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. For the benefit of newsmen at the Houston news center, there will be a briefing in the main auditorium momentarily regarding the Apollo pressure suit; the briefer will be Mr. Bruce Ferguson of ILC Industries, in the main auditorium to start within the next few moments. At 93 hours, 49 minutes, Ground Elapsed Time, and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
093:51:52|T|LMP|And Joe, how you read now?
093:51:55|C|Kerwin|Satisfactory, Fred. Go ahead.
093:52:01|T|LMP|Okay. Back to the condensate container. I guess the only question I really need answered is will it leak?
093:52:11|C|Kerwin|Is will it leak? Oh, yes. Stand by 1.
093:52:22|T|LMP|And we've checked all the fittings and I know I can hook everything up to our UCDs. So, if it doesn't leak, we can transfer.
093:52:31|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. We still don't have a final answer on whether or not it'll leak. if you need it, I'd go ahead and use it; and standing by for your completion of the hose-insertion procedure.
093:52:52|T|LMP|Okay. The hose-insertion procedure in to the second cartridge is complete.
093:52:59|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's complete. The next step is to switch to the primary CO<sub>2</sub> canister and remove the secondary canister and stow it. Over.
093:53:14|T|LMP|Okay. I'm going to have to get off comm here; I'll let Jack get the headset.
093:53:19|C|Kerwin|Okay.
093:53:28|T|CMP|Hey, Joe. I'm on the headset now.
093:54:06|T|LMP|Is that secondary? ... secondary?
093:54:24|T|CMP|Both cartridges are out.
093:54:33|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. Fred has the secondary cartridge out. We're back on primary now.
093:54:39|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. The next step is to place the Command Module canisters with the hoses attached in a suitable location to permit the bottom of the canister to be exposed to free airflow and tape them in place. Ideally, well, it doesn't matter. Just - just pick out your own spot.
093:55:05|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going to tell you where they are. They're both situated, as you say, with the bottom of the canister exposed to free air, and one is sitting right by the - the LMP's is sitting right by the EPS panel, and the CDR's is up in the tunnel.
093:55:26|C|Kerwin|Jack, Houston. The comm got real noisy there, and I didn't copy that. Stand by a moment.
093:56:02|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. How do you read now?
093:56:04|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's real good, Jack; go ahead.
093:56:09|T|CMP|Okay. The canisters are situated as you - as you would like with the bottom of the canister exposed to free air.
093:56:17|C|Kerwin|Okay.
093:56:18|T|CMP|The position of the LMP's canister - The LMP's canister is sitting on the EPS panel now, and the CDR's canister is positioned up in the tunnel.
093:56:31|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real fine, Jack. The next step is to physically separate both blue hoses a good distance away from the canister so that we don't short circuit the flow, and tape them in place; and the ideal location for them would be up in the turmel so as to get, some flow into the Command Module. Over.
093:56:57|T|CMP|Both hoses in the - up into the Command Module?
093:57:03|C|Kerwin|Oh, you can use your judgment on that, Jack. We'd like at least one, and the recommendation that I got was to put them both up in the tunnel.
093:57:15|T|CMP|Okay. We have the LMP's blue hose up by the LMP's window and the - Of course, the red hose is separated by some 4 feet. And the - Okay. We're going to - and the other hose - the - has the extension on it - The CDR's blue hose, of course, has the extension on it, and it's blowing way up in the Command Module. And the red hose is about - Oh, it's right at the docking ring where the blue latches are, so there's about 4 or 5 feet difference from there, too. Is this satisfactory?
093:58:03|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. That sounds satisfactory. The next steps are - are suit-loop configuration steps, and the first one is to  -
093:58:14|T|CMP|Okay. SUIT DIV  -
093:58:17|C|Kerwin|-  is to place the Suit Diverter valve to the PULL-EGRESS position.
093:58:26|T|CMP|Okay. Suit Diverter valve to PULL-EGRESS.
093:58:31|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative  -
093:58:32|T|CMP|That's done  -
093:58:33|C|Kerwin|Okay. The next step is CABIN GAS RETURN to EGRESS. Over.
093:58:43|T|Unrecognized crewman|...
093:59:13|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The briefing on the Apollo suit should begin momentarily in the main auditorium in the Houston News Center. Bruce Ferguson of ILC C industries.
093:59:24|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. Did you copy CABIN GAS RETURN to EGRESS. Over.
093:59:32|T|CMP|No, I didn't get that, Joe. CABIN GAS RETURN to EGRESS.
093:59:37|C|Kerwin|That's correct.
093:59:43|T|CMP|Okay. That's done.
093:59:45|C|Kerwin|Okay. Next, SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF to CLOSE. Over.
093:59:52|T|CMP|SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF to CLOSE.
093:59:55|C|Kerwin|Roger.
094:00:01|T|CMP|Okay. I got that done.
094:00:03|C|Kerwin|Okay. And the last step is select secondary CO<sub>2</sub> canister. We'll let it flow through the empty hole, and let's see how we do.
094:00:13|T|CMP|Select secondary CO<sub>2</sub> canister.
094:00:16|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jack. That completes that procedure, and the next thing I've got for you is a procedure for going back into the Command Module and powering up the main buses temporarily using the BUS TIE switches. We want to do this for two reasons: first of all, we want it absolutely verified that there are no loads on the main buses, that we've got: everything off and that the buses look good; and the second thing we want to do is to power the bus - the main buses, with the BUS TIE motor switches, and then depower them by pulling the circuit breakers, leaving the Main Bus Tie switches in the On position, just to assure that they'll be there when we need them, whether the batteries get cold or not. Over.
094:00:16|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jack. That completes that procedure, and the next thing I've got for you is a procedure for going back into the Command Module and powering up the main buses temporarily using the BUS TIE switches. We want to do this for two reasons: first of all, we want it absolutely verified that there are no loads on the main buses, that we've got: everything off and that the buses look good; and the second thing we want to do is to power the bus - the main buses, with the BUS TIE motor switches, and then depower them by pulling the circuit breakers, leaving the Main Bus Tie switches in the On position, just to assure that they'll be there when we need them, whether the batteries get cold or not. Over.
094:01:08|T|CMP|Okay. Why ...
094:01:33|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. How you read?
094:01:36|C|Kerwin|Better now, Jack. Satisfactory. Did you copy my rationale for the main bus powerup?
094:01:45|T|CMP|Yes, I did. You want to remove - You want to power up both buses, with the BUS TIE motor switches; first of all, to see that there are no loads on the buses, and second, and then depower the buses by pulling the circuit breakers to insure that the motor switches don't - that the BUS TIES stay armed so that they're there when we need them.
094:02:09|C|Kerwin|That's correct, Jack. Are you ready to copy the procedure?
094:02:15|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
094:02:16|C|Kerwin|Okay. As the first step, I have one change to the basic configuration that we gave you, and it's two more circuit breakers that we want open. On panel 225 - Are you ready to write that down? Over.
094:02:35|T|CMP|Yes. I'm all ready, Joe. Go ahead.
094:02:48|T|CMP|Joe, I'm all ready. Go ahead.
094:02:50|C|Kerwin|Okay. On panel 225, we want the Rendezvous Transponder FLIGHT BUS circuit breaker open, and the S-BAND FM TRANSMITTER/DSE FLIGHT BUS circuit breaker open. Over.
094:03:24|T|CMP|Okay. CB Rendezvous Transponder FLIGHT BUS, open; CB S-BAND TRANSMITTER/DSE FLIGHT BUS open on panel 225.
094:03:35|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's correct, Jack. And now we'll go into the main bus powerup procedure. And the first step there, is on panel 5. We want the BAT CHARGER BAT A CHARGE circuit breaker closed, and the BAT CHARGER BAT B CHARGE circuit breaker closed. Over.
094:04:15|T|CMP|Okay. That's BAT CHARGER BAT A CHARGE, BAT CHARGER BAT B CHARGE, both closed on panel 5.
094:04:25|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative. We need them closed to power the switches. Next on panel 5, we want the EPS SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN A and MAIN B circuit breakers closed. Over.
094:04:52|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 5, CB EPS sensor's signals MAIN A and MAIN B closed.
094:05:00|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's affirmative. We need them closed so that you can read out your volts and amps. Next step, on panel 250, we want circuit breaker BAT A POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING and BAT B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed. Over.
094:05:38|T|CMP|Okay on panel 250, CB BAT A POWER, ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed; BAT B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.
094:05:50|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative. And at that point, we'd like you to check the BAT bus voltages on both BAT buses to make sure we don't have any shorts. Over.
094:06:09|T|CMP|Okay. Read the BAT bus voltages on BAT BUS A and BAT BUS B.
094:06:13|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative. The next step on panel 275: circuit breaker MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed, and circuit breaker MAIN B, BAT BUS B, closed. Over.
094:06:44|T|CMP|Okay. On 275, circuit breakers MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed; MAIN B, BAT BUS B, closed.
094:06:56|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative. The next step on panel 5: we want the Main Bus Tie A/C switch to the BAT A/C position, and verify proper voltage on MAIN BUS A, and read the amps on BAT A to make sure we don't have a short. Over.
094:07:29|T|CMP|Okay. Place Main Bus Tie A/C, on, and read Main Bus A volts and current.
094:07:46|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack, Houston. We're in bad comm again; let's wait a minute.
094:08:03|T|CMP|Okay. How do you read?
094:08:04|C|Kerwin|That's better, Jack. Go ahead with your readback.
094:08:10|T|CMP|Okay. Place Main Bus Tie A/C, on, read MAIN BUS A current and voltage.
094:08:19|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's affirmative. The next step will be the Main Bus Tie B/C switch to the ON position and read MAIN B voltage and battery B amperage as above. Over.
094:08:49|T|CMP|Okay, Main Bus Tie B/C on; read MAIN B voltage and current.
094:08:55|C|Kerwin|Okay. That is correct. Then to reconfigure from this configuration, Jack, we want you to leave the Main Bus Tie switches in the ON position and pull the circuit breakers out in reverse order that we had you close them. Over; and do you want me to read them up individually?
094:09:17|T|CMP|No, let me see if I've got it here. I go down to panel 275, open CB MAIN A, BAT BUS A and CB MAIN B, BAT BUS B. Then I go down to 250, and pull CB BAT A POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING and BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING and then up on panel 5, pull EPS SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN A, SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN B, BATTERY CHARGER BAT B CHARGE, BATTERY CHARGER BAT A CHARGE. And then close - I don't know whether you want me to close the Rendezvous Radar TRANSPONDER FLIGHT BUS and S-BAND TRANSMITTER/DSE FLIGHT BUS.
094:10:03|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. We don't want you to close those last two. Those are changes to your basic configuration, and we want to leave them open for now. Over.
094:10:15|T|CMP|Okay. I'll do that. Was the rest of the readback okay?
094:10:17|C|Kerwin|That's correct. Readback was 100 percent, and we'll wait to hear from you.
094:10:32|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. And just for confirmation, I went through the switch list you gave me. We are in exactly that configuration with one exception, and that is over on panel 382. I have left, the a - H<sub>2</sub>O ACCUMULATOR is in the OFF position so that if we need any more water, we can get it.
094:11:05|C|Kerwin|Okay. Roger, Jack. Copy that. On panel 382, you've left the H<sub>2</sub>O ACCUMULATOR valves in the OFF position, and we concur.
094:11:16|T|CMP|Okay. And there's one other thing that I don't know whether you're aware of. We have no lithium hydroxide canisters in panel two fif - in the canisters now. So when we get ready to power up, you'll have to remind us when you want us to add some.
094:11:38|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. We copied that. That's correct, and I'll add that to our basic checklist so that we won't forget it.
094:11:47|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine, Joe, and I'm on my way back into the Command Module.
094:11:51|C|Kerwin|Good deal.
094:11:53|T|CMP|Thank you.
094:12:04|T|LMP|How do you read, Joe?
094:12:19|T|LMP|And, Joe, how do you read Aquarius?
094:12:23|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Pretty good. Go ahead.
094:12:29|T|LMP|Okay. I'm back on the line now, but Jack really meant, is he's headed back to the upstairs bedroom.
094:12:39|C|Kerwin|Okay. Roger that, Fred.
094:13:01|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
094:13:06|T|LMP|Go ahead.
094:13:07|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. We recommend that you push your Master Alarm circuit breaker in so you'll have audio and visual on that, and, also, we medical types are getting to feel left out down here, and we'd like you to give us BIOMED either position, if you're plugged in for it, and we'll see whether it affects the voice or not. Over.
094:13:36|T|LMP|Okay.
094:14:22|T|LMP|Hey, Houston; Aquarius. On DOWN VOICE BACKUP S-band, how do you read me?
094:14:28|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Read you now satisfactory.
094:14:36|T|LMP|Okay. And I'm plugged in.
094:14:39|C|Kerwin|Okay. Thank you very much, Fred.
094:14:46|T|LMP|Actually, a good deal of that little power pack heats up and ...
094:14:53|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
094:19:11|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
094:19:14|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
094:19:18|T|LMP|Okay, Jack just drifts on back down. And after he put on the 250 BAT A, BAT B breakers, he read BAT bus volts as 32.3 on A, 37.0 on B; he then punched in the 275 breakers, which tied the batteries to the buses, and at that time he read the A bus volts 32.0 on A, zero amps; 37.0 on B, zero amps.
094:19:59|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. The comm got noisy there, and I want to make sure we get these numbers right, so I'd like to ask you to repeat them, if I may.
094:21:00|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read now, Joe?
094:21:01|C|Kerwin|Okay; probably okay, Fred. Read it nice and slow so we'll be sure to get it. Over.
094:21:10|T|LMP|Okay. Jack pushed in the 250 BAT A, BAT B entry breakers. He read battery bus volts as 32.3 on A, 37.0 on B. Then he pushed in the 275 breakers tying the BATs to the main buses. In this configuration, MAIN A is at 32.0 volts, zero amps; MAIN B is at 37.0 volts, zero amps. So it looks like the buses are okay.
094:21:47|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. Copy those numbers and thank you very much. I assume he got them off all right.
094:22:00|T|LMP|That's affirm. We got all the breakers pulled again.
094:22:03|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real fine.
094:32:33|T|LMP|Hey, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?
094:32:38|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
094:32:43|T|LMP|Okay. How did our lith-o configurations appear to be working down there?
094:32:54|C|Kerwin|I'm sorry, Fred, but we got noisy again there.
094:33:02|T|LMP|Okay. Let me know when you want me to try it.
094:33:05|C|Kerwin|Okay. That sounds better already. Go ahead.
094:33:11|T|LMP|Okay. I'd just like to see how's - how's our lith-o cartridge setup option appear to be working down there.
094:33:21|C|Kerwin|We are reading 0.2 on our CO<sub>2</sub> sensor, and we're all delighted. It seems to be working fine.
094:33:31|T|LMP|Boy, that is great.
094:33:40|C|Kerwin|And Fred, Houston. In a little while here, I'm going to have a procedure that I want to read up to you and have you copy down for future use. It's a procedure for powering the Command Module main bus off the LM, and it's something that we feel that's going to come in real handy later on for such things as topping off the Command Module entry batteries, and also possibly for doing some preheating and preliminary powering up of the Command Module before we get rid of the LM. We'll have that for you in probably 10 or 15 minutes. Over.
094:34:25|T|LMP|Okay, okay, Joe. Sounds good. ... switch.
094:34:31|C|Kerwin|Roger.
094:36:11|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
094:36:16|T|LMP|Go ahead.
094:36:18|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. Our procedure-generating mill has generated another very short one for you here. It's a procedure for getting an onboard read-out  -
094:36:27|T|LMP|Stand by 1, Joe.
094:36:38|C|Kerwin|Okay.
094:37:02|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. Go ahead.
094:37:05|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. This is a procedure for getting a read-out of the descent propellant tank temps. It's no big problem, but our LM people say that the bottom of the descent stage is probably cooling off, and we just want to verify that the descent water tank will be okay. Right now, it looks as though it won't freeze until several hours after it's empty, but we want to have you read these temperatures out to us so we can see how good our predictions are. The procedure is, on panel 16, close the PROPELLANT DISPLAY/ENGINE OVERRIDE LOGIC circuit breaker. Over.
094:38:12|T|LMP|Okay. The PROPELLANT DISPLAY OVERRIDE breakers are closed. ... the propellant.
094:38:21|C|Kerwin|Right, Fred. The next step is simply to turn the PROPELLANT TEMP PRESS MONITOR switch to DESCENT 1, read the fuel and OX temps, turn it to DESCENT 2, read the fuel and OX temps; tell us what they are.
094:38:44|T|LMP|Okay. On DESCENT 1, I get a fuel temp of 66.5 degrees, oxidizer 66 degrees, on DESCENT 2, I get ...
094:39:05|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. We're in noisy comm here; I got DESCENT 1 fuel 66.5; stand by a second.
094:39:35|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read, now ...?
094:39:37|C|Kerwin|That's better. Go ahead.
094:39:41|T|LMP|Okay. You got 66.5 on DESCENT 1 fuel temp, oxidizer temp is 66 degrees.
094:39:53|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy  -
094:39:54|T|LMP|On DESCENT TANK 2, fuel is reading 60 - Okay. DESCENT 2 fuel is reading 68 degrees; oxidizer, 65 degrees.
094:40:03|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that, Fred. Thank you. We'd like you to pull the circuit breaker, and we'll probably come to you again in 5 or 6 hours for another check.
094:40:14|T|LMP|Okay. The panel 16 the ENGINE LOGIC OVERRIDE is open.
094:40:19|C|Kerwin|Roger.
094:41:32|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 94 hours 41 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Position and velocity now showing 178,274 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity 3,982 feet per second. Spacecraft weight still hovering around 87,942 pounds. 94 hours 42 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and standing by this is Apollo Control.
094:46:28|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
094:46:59|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
094:47:05|T|LMP|Go ahead.
094:47:10|C|Kerwin|Okay. We're chasing a small glitch that we saw a while ago in the O<sub>2</sub> flow rate which is now normal again, but what we'd like you to do is, first of all, to tell us whether, during that canister procedure, you moved O<sub>2</sub> DEMAND REG A to any position other than CABIN, and then we'd like you to move it to OFF momentarily and back to CABIN for us.
094:47:39|T|LMP|Okay. To answer your question, Joe, it's no. It's been in CABIN all the time. Qualitatively, when we switched to this configuration, it didn't seem like the frequency or the suit fan noise I assume decreased slightly, as if it logged down a little bit, but I'll follow your procedure. You want me to take REG A, go to close and back to CABIN; is that correct?
094:48:10|C|Kerwin|That's correct, Fred.
094:48:15|T|LMP|Okay. We're in CLOSE.
094:48:18|C|Kerwin|Okay.
094:48:22|T|LMP|Now, I'm back to CABIN.
094:48:24|C|Kerwin|Okay. Thank you very much, Fred. I'll get back to you if we see anything.
094:50:42|T|LMP|...
094:50:47|C|Kerwin|Hey, have you guys got a woman on board?
094:50:57|T|LMP|No way I could handle that.
094:51:30|T|LMP|And, Joe, do you have a distance out from the Moon?
094:51:39|C|Kerwin|I'm not sure I copied that, Fred. If you asked me whether I had that powerup procedure, I don't have it for you, yet. Over.
094:51:54|T|LMP|No. The question was, do you have a distance out from the Moon.
094:52:04|C|Kerwin|Still didn't understand, Fred. I'm sorry.
094:52:08|T|LMP|Okay. We'll be able to get better comm.
094:52:09|C|Kerwin|Roger.
094:53:00|T|LMP|Okay.
094:53:55|C|Kerwin|Fred, Houston. You want to try it, now?
094:54:12|T|LMP|How do you read, Houston?
094:54:14|C|Kerwin|That's pretty good, Fred.
094:54:19|T|LMP|Okay. Two things: first of all, we noticed a ... fresh particles, coming up from below
094:54:30|C|Kerwin|Gol darn it. Just as you started talking, it got noisy again, Fred; try it again.
094:54:37|T|LMP|Okay.
094:54:45|C|Kerwin|Try it now, loud and slow.
094:54:51|T|LMP|Okay. Jack had a question on how far out from the Moon are we now?
094:55:04|C|Kerwin|On how far out what?
094:55:08|T|LMP|From the Moon we are now?
094:55:10|C|Kerwin|Oh. Our little plot shows you just touching the 180-thousand-mile line. So you're about 40 K out from the Moon.
094:55:20|T|LMP|Okay. Okay. And the other thing is, we've noticed some fresh new particles floating around outside, so possibly the Service Module is starting to vent a little bit again.
094:55:39|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that, Fred. On the O<sub>2</sub> flow thing, we clearly saw the DEMAND REGULATOR go to OFF and back to CABIN. TELMU thinks that it's no big thing that you've seen a little change in flow due to the different resistance we've got in the circuit.
094:56:01|T|LMP|Roger.
094:56:28|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
094:56:33|T|LMP|Go ahead.
094:56:35|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. Recommend you go to OFF on the BIOMED switch. We never did get any BIOMED and it might clear up the comm a little bit.
094:56:49|T|LMP|Okay. How you read now?
094:56:52|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. That might be a little better.
094:57:41|T|LMP|We're on the 180 - K line, right now.
094:57:44|T|LMP|From Earth.
094:57:47|T|LMP|We're about 40 050.
094:58:04|T|LMP|... It's five, sixth of the way there.
094:58:11|T|LMP|Okay. It's ... there.
094:58:16|T|LMP|Just split the difference.
094:58:19|T|LMP|Yes.
094:58:21|T|LMP|180 K. We got another ... K ... -
094:58:25|T|CMP|Is that right?
094:58:26|T|LMP|- from there on.
094:58:35|T|LMP|That midcourse should be interesting. You know, the mode we're going to do it in.
094:58:42|T|LMP|Manual AGS. It's a DPS burn. We're controlling the TTCA attitude.
094:58:49|T|CMP|... something like that?
094:58:52|T|LMP|Fortunately.
094:58:54|T|LMP|We can't help them too much. Actually it isn't ... but AGS burn shortly ... goddamned unfortunate. In part, I get a feeling ... now when I get ... Just before ... goes to zero in 1 second I'm going to pull them out ...
094:59:35|T|LMP|Another burn that's never been done.
094:59:43|T|LMP|Go to the - Go to the techniqueS for a lainding and ... it's the burn technique.
095:00:02|T|LMP|I'm sure they got something written out, maybe in the...
095:00:09|T|LMP|A what?
095:00:13|T|LMP|Well, hell, Jack. All you - you don't use a very good one. If you - just if you'll go to that attitude reference for roll and the g-meter backup. Because, really, you can almost tumble the Command Module and your odds are 60 to 40 that you're going to hit Earth blunt-end first, without any reference.
095:00:38|T|LMP|Before I didn't realize that. That proves you've got a little bit above 50-percent odds that you're going to enter blunt end, and  -
095:00:49|T|LMP|We made an entry like that in Apollo 8 in a sim with Houston, ol' Buzz went and turned on the Command Module heaters and left them on. The activators, they went, "Shooo!" both tanks; we had no gas. Just had a real slow rate going. We actually went out in the console and started debriefing, but left it running and watched it; and the son of a bitch did a hop-skipout, a hopout, underneath ..., but not much, and then we did a long hop ... but - The second reentry, also, it did one and - both times. It lucked out twice and it really flew in, it went to zero g ...
095:01:45|T|LMP|Yes.
095:02:01|T|LMP|Yes, we did, Jack. ... No ... here it is ...
095:03:36|T|LMP|... But we're in this wobble.
095:03:40|T|LMP|Few more passes and then it'll come back down.
095:06:02|T|LMP|Hey, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read me?
095:06:04|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Okay. Go ahead.
095:06:11|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. It - Our wobble in this PTC has picked up where the Moon is running by pretty high in the window and the Earth pretty low; so I expect - On the side where the Moon's present, we're having a little bit of trouble with the comm breakout there in a couple of places.
095:06:37|C|Kerwin|Okay. Roger that, Fred.
095:08:33|T|LMP|... pressure gage as far as this noise ... get the thing from the AFT. ... scientific ...
095:09:10|T|CMP|Houston, Aquarius.
095:09:13|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go.
095:09:20|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. I'm all set to copy that procedure for powering up the Command Module from the LM, whenever you want to give it to me. When did you, I guess you want to put battery A on CHARGE, huh?
095:09:32|C|Kerwin|Jack, we're not certain when the best time is to implement this procedure, and what we want to do at this time is read it up to you, so you'll have it and understand it and we'll - We'll be able to do it quickly when the time comes. And I don't have it for you quite yet. Over.
095:09:56|T|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. All right. I'll be standing by to copy it whenever you get it.
095:10:03|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack.
095:11:34|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
095:11:42|T|CMP|Joe, I got to switch antennas here. Okay, Joe. I read you on the FORWARD antenna.
095:11:52|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack, I have the procedure now to read up to you. Before I do, I want to mention something that will be of interest to Fred. We are looking at the SHe tank pressure rise and we expect it to blow. We don't know exactly what time it will go, somewhere around 105 hours or perhaps later than that. We've got plenty of blowdown capability. We just thought you ought to be informed. Over.
095:12:23|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by. I'll tell him, now.
095:12:27|C|Kerwin|Okay.
095:12:28|T|CMP|Fred, they said they're looking at the SHe tank pressure rise, and they expect it to blow somewhere around 105 hours. She tank pressure ... Okay. Fred thought they did, so no sweat.
095:12:48|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real fine. Are you ready for the procedure, now, Jack?
095:12:55|T|CMP|Yes. Joe, how long is it? Is it a big long one, or a short one, or a medium sized one that will go on how many pages?
095:13:01|C|Kerwin|It's about - I'd say 15 to 20 steps, Jack. Some of it is LM stuff, and the rest of it is in CSM.
095:13:15|T|CMP|Okay. I got a fresh page here, and I'm ready to copy.
095:13:18|C|Kerwin|Okay. I'll give you the LM steps first. They have to be done first, and the first step is on panels 11 and 16, circuit breakers ASCENT ECA, ASC ECA, two to close. Over.
095:13:42|T|CMP|Okay. Panels 11 and 16 CBs ASCENT ECA to closed.
095:13:50|C|Kerwin|Okay. Next step: panels 11 and 16 CB ASCENT ECA CONTROL, two, to close. Over.
095:14:11|T|CMP|Okay. On 11 and 16 CBs ASCENT ECA CONTROLs to close.
095:14:19|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's correct. The next step is BAT 5 and 6 NORMAL FEED to high; those are switches.
095:14:41|T|CMP|Okay. BATs 5 and 6 NORMAL FEED, ON.
095:14:46|C|Kerwin|That's correct. Next step: BATs 1 and 3 to OFF slash RESET. Over.
095:15:05|T|CMP|BATs 1 and 3 to OFF slash RESET.
095:15:09|C|Kerwin|That's correct. Next step: wait 30 minutes for preconditioning. Over.
095:15:23|T|CMP|Okay. That's wait 30 minutes for preconditioning.
095:15:29|C|Kerwin|That's correct, and the last LM step for now is BATs 2 and 4 to OFF/RESET. Over.
095:15:50|T|CMP|Okay. BATs 2 and 4 to OFF/RESET.
095:15:55|C|Kerwin|That's correct. Now we'll go to the CSM, and the first step there is connect LM/CSM umbilical. Over.
095:16:13|T|CMP|Okay. Connect LM/CSM umbilical.
095:16:17|C|Kerwin|Okay. The next step on panel 5, CB LM POWER-1 MAIN B and LM POWER-2 MAIN B, both, closed. Over.
095:16:43|T|CMP|Okay. On panel 5, CB LM POWER-1 MAIN B and 2 MAIN B, both, closed.
095:16:52|C|Kerwin|That's correct. On panel 5, CB EPS SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN B to close. Over.
095:17:11|T|CMP|EPS SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN B closed on panel 5.
095:17:16|C|Kerwin|That's correct. Next step, panel 250: CB BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING; closed. Over.
095:17:40|T|CMP|Okay. On panel 250: CB BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING; closed. Over.
095:17:50|C|Kerwin|That's Charlie. Verify MAIN BUS voltage; then, LM POWER switch on panel 2 to CSM. Over.
095:18:14|T|CMP|Okay. That's verify the MAIN BUS voltage, and switch LM POWER to CSM.
095:18:23|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's correct. Then go back to 275, CB MAIN B BAT BUS B to open. Hey, Jack, that's the step I skipped for you, I'm afraid. Before verifying MAIN BUS voltage, you have to, on panel 275, close CB MAIN B BAT BUS B. Over.
095:19:07|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. How are you reading on the AFT OMNI.
095:19:11|C|Kerwin|You're okay now. Go ahead.
095:19:15|T|CMP|Okay. After putting the BATTERY B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING ON, then I want to push the - on panel 275 MAIN B to BAT BUS B in, huh?
095:19:38|C|Kerwin|That's right. Then you go to verify MAIN BUS voltage, LM POWER to CSM, and then, on panel 275, circuit breaker MAIN B BAT BUS B to open. Over.
095:19:53|T|CMP|Okay. After verifying the MAIN BUS voltage connecting the LM POWER to CSM I want to pull MAIN B BAT BUS B, or MAIN B to BAT BUS B, open.
095:20:06|C|Kerwin|That's correct. And then on panel 250, circuit breaker BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING to open, and verify MAIN BUS B voltage.
095:20:37|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 250 BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING open, and then verify the MAIN BUS voltage.
095:20:44|C|Kerwin|Okey. That's correct. The last, steps are to get LM back to descent batteries. The first step is Bats 1, 2, 3 and 4, HI VOLTAGE, ON, Over.
095:21:12|T|CMP|Okay. Then the next step is a LM step, BATs 1, 2, 3 and 4, HI VOLTAGE, ON.
095:21:19|C|Kerwin|That's correct, and the last step in LM, BATs 5 and 6 to OFF. Over.
095:21:33|T|CMP|Okay. Say again you cut out there, Joe.
095:21:36|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. The last step in LM, BATTERIES 5 and 6 to OFF. Over.
095:21:47|T|CMP|Okay, BATs 5 and 6 to OFF.
095:21:51|C|Kerwin|That's correct. That should configure you. Note that circuit-breakers, protection on that circuit limits the available current to 15 amps. We think we can do quite a bit with it though. And the LM/CSM umbilical will be hot and MAIN BUS voltage may be monitored by selecting MAIN B on the gage. Over.
095:22:16|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine.
095:22:18|C|Kerwin|Good deal, Jack.
095:22:22|T|CMP|Okay. And I'll be ready to implement this whenever you call it up.
095:22:26|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
095:22:54|T|LMP|And how do you read, Joe?
095:22:56|C|Kerwin|Pretty good, Fred.
095:23:00|T|LMP|Okay. While Jack was on comm, I was looking out the docking window here, and I could see another good shower off particles coming out of the Service Module. And the position this time appears to be on the other side. Before, we'd always seen them out of window 1, and where I'm looking at it from here, it looks like it'd be down below window 6 somewhere in the Service Module. Jack's going upstairs to see what it looks like up there.
095:23:33|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good deal. We copy that, Fred. And to show you how relaxed we are about the entry, Ken is looking at - giving you guys a chance to - prior to going into entry, PREP to snap a few pictures of the Service Module.
095:23:56|T|LMP|Ken is, huh? (Laughter)
095:24:02|C|Kerwin|Yes, he's got all that film up there, and he doesn't want to waste it.
095:24:06|T|LMP|Oh, I thought maybe you'd want me to do a PLSS EVA to go shoot pictures or something.
095:24:11|C|Kerwin|Okay, okay.
095:24:22|T|LMP|You're right; we got a lot of pictures.
095:24:34|T|LMP|I guess I agree it surely would be nice to document it someway if we can, but it doesn't look like ...
095:24:45|C|Kerwin|Yes, we think it'd be a lot of help.
095:25:41|T|LMP|Joe, how do you read me?
095:25:45|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
095:25:50|T|LMP|Okay. The condensate transfer works great.
095:25:57|C|Kerwin|Stand by a minute, Fred. We're in a bad comm mode.
095:26:00|T|LMP|Okay.
095:26:16|T|LMP|Okay. How's that?
095:26:17|C|Kerwin|That's better.
095:26:21|T|LMP|Okay. The waste transfer into the condensate can works real well, Joe.
095:26:29|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good deal.
095:26:33|T|LMP|So, I guess we can keep FIDO happy with no overboard dumps.
095:26:39|C|Kerwin|Roger that. (Long pause.)
095:27:14|T|LMP|Yes, that brings up one more possibility, Joe.
095:27:19|C|Kerwin|Say again, Fred.
095:27:23|T|LMP|Brings up another possibility. Now that we've got all of that stowed into the bags and the condensate can, we could probably blow all of that through the PLSS fitting, I wonder how the sublimator would work on waste water.
095:27:39|C|Kerwin|It might work if we had to do it, Fred. Right now we're looking at a comfortable excess of water through the sublimator. We were talking among ourselves this morning about having you try out the PLSS to ascent tank water-transfer situation and we decided not to do it, not to recommend it, because we figure it'd take us 30 hours to empty one of the ascent tanks, which you have to do in order to get PLSS water to it, and we'd rather use the descent water and we don't think we've gotten any sweat. Over.
095:28:21|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. I don't think there's any question about it from the plumbing standpoint that we could do that if we had to.
095:28:36|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that.
095:30:38|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 95 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Present thinking on the midcourse correction which would bring Apollo 13 back into the Earth's intercepting corridor, would be a LM maneuver, propulsion maneuver of about 7 feet per second at 104 hours Ground Elapsed Time and would return the spacecraft to entry corridor shooting for a flight path angle of about minus 6-1/2 degrees on all lunar missions to date, with a few exceptions, during the trans-Earth coast phase some sort of midcourse correction has been necessary to get back on to the corridor depending on the accuracy of the transearth injection. This particular mission is certainly no different. Spacecraft communicator Joe Kerwin is away from the console at the moment, after having read up some additional checklist changes. We are continuing to monitor the air-to-ground. Kerwin returning to the console. If the midcoure correction in this trans Earth phase is delayed beyond 104 hours to the second one, it's in contention of second time of 118 hours, it would be somewhat greater magnitude more in the neighborhood of 40 feet per second. With the 7 foot per second midcourse correction at 104 hours, the vacuum perigee would be around 20 nautical miles. Flight path angle of minus 6.51 degrees. AT 95 hours 32 minutes, Ground Elapsed Time and standing by this is Apollo Control.
095:40:35|T|LMP|And, how do you read, Joe?
095:40:40|C|Kerwin|Read you pretty good, Fred. Go ahead.
095:40:45|T|LMP|I think our PTC wobble is growing worse. The Earth now is really up to the top of the window. I have to get way down almost to the floorboards to view it. Conversely, the Moon is way down at the bottom of the window.
095:41:06|C|Kerwin|Okay.
095:41:09|T|LMP|A lot more wobble.
095:41:10|C|Kerwin|Roger  -
095:41:11|T|LMP|Far more wobble than I noticed on my previous watch.
095:41:19|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copied that, Fred. And our thermal people will be looking at it. One of the things we're talking about relative to the midcourse correction is we'd like not to do it before the SHe tank goes, if it's going to go, just so it won't give us a problem reestablishing PTC. And right now our people think that the burst disk will pop around 106 hours.
095:41:52|T|LMP|Okay.
095:44:26|T|LMP|The L-shaped bag is ...
095:46:33|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
095:46:39|T|LMP|Go ahead.
095:46:40|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. Since you went ahead and used the PLSS condensate container, we got the procedure in for using it. I'm not going to read it up to you except that it cautions a little bit about shaking it too much or about filling it too full, because they feel that if you do that the vent valve might unseat and the bag might leak a little bit. Over.
095:47:10|T|LMP|Okay. We haven't removed it from its stowage spot. We just left it right in place, and just - he mated the tank at the end of the cable and hooked right into that.
095:47:25|C|Kerwin|Understand. That's satisfactory and recommended that you leave it in the stowage spot. That should help the situation.
095:47:37|T|LMP|Roger.
095:48:27|T|LMP|We got a - we got another flow shower going on outside. Particles, seeing them vented against the Service Module. Jack thinks it may be an H<sub>2</sub> vent. Something of that ...
095:48:41|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that. What window are you looking at it out of, Fred?
095:48:48|T|LMP|Out the LM docking window.
095:48:50|C|Kerwin|The docking window. Roger that. Somebody just handed me your latest consumables status report, and you're using between 11 to 12 amps an hour real steady, and it looks real good.
095:49:08|T|LMP|Splendid.
096:00:38|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 96 hours. At the present time the discussions here in the Mission Control Room about the midcourse correction, are beginning to firm up toward a definite time, heretofore, the times under discussion were 10 - 104 hours and 113 hours. Right now it's shaping up to look like we'll do the midcourse correction to bend the trajectory back to the entry corridor with a vacuum perigee of around 20 nautical miles. The burn would be at 105:30 ground elapsed time; descent propulsion system burn 7.6 feet per second; 14.8 seconds duration. This burn would be - is being timed to coincide with the estimated time that the burst disk in the supercritical helium in the lunar module will give way, so that the effects on the trajectory would be lessened in having both the burn and any perturbations in the trajectory come at the same time. The vent from the supercritical helium now is non-propulsive, that is, there's a T in the line and it should cancel out any DELTA-V added by the venting, however, there's somewhat - a certain amount of uncertainty in this regard. At any rate, having the burn and the burst disk event near the same time frame gets both of these events out of the way and it gives a good long bit of tracking to pin down what the new trajectory will be. We're now showing 0.1 millimeters in mercury partial pressure carbon dioxide in the lunar module. So, apparently the shade tree engineering using the command module lithium hydroxide cannisters in the plastic bag and the suit hoses, is working out all right. And at 96 hours, 3 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control."
096:14:58|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 96 hours 15 minutes ground elapsed time. There's some white sacks with sandwiches being brought into the room by a young lady. Getting back to midcourse correction in the transearth coast phase here in Apollo 13, the current thinking is to do a descent propulsion system maneuver at about 105 hours 30 minutes ground elapsed time 7.6 feet per second. The burn time of 14.8 seconds. Apollo 8, back in December 1968, did a similar burn in about a similar time. However, it was a command module or service module RCS burn of 4.8 seconds - 4.8 feet per second at 103:58. The burn is intentionally timed to the estimated time frame in which the lunar module super critical helium burst disc is suppose to let go. It's not anticipated that this burst disc, the venting of the super critical helium will cause any perturbations to the trajectory and that vent outlet has a T on it and thereby cancels out any propulsion. It's called an non-propulsive vent. Having the burn and the burst disc take place in the same time frame will allow the tracking after these events to provide a good handle on spacecraft trajectory for refining the - into the recorder and calculations towards entry. There's quite a bit propulsion available out of the spacecraft up to some 28 feet per second still available with the vehicle that weighs in the neighborhood of 87,000 pounds. For the small RCS thrusters on the lunar module, 28 feet per second available out of that system. Still a great deal of propulsion available in the descent propulsion system and one as yet untapped system. That's the ascent propulsion engine in the upper stage of the lunar module which likely won't even be used at all. Rather quiet now in the air to ground circuit. Taking a lunch break here in Mission Control. Sandwiches were brought in as mentioned earlier and most of the people are taking this opportunity to have a mid-afternoon snack. At 96 hours 18 minutes and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
096:20:45|T|CMP|Joe, what are you showing for GET now?
096:20:50|C|Kerwin|I think you wanted the GET, Jack, and the present GET is 96 hours 21 minutes. Over.
096:21:01|T|CMP|Okay, thank you.
096:21:03|C|Kerwin|Okay.
096:21:16|C|Kerwin|And Jack, Houston. For your information, FIDO tells me that we are in the Earth's sphere of influence and we're starting to accelerate.
096:21:29|T|CMP|I thought it was about time we crossed. Thank you.
096:21:33|C|Kerwin|Roger.
096:21:39|T|CMP|We're on our way back home.
096:21:49|T|CMP|There's something that puzzles me, Joe. Vance mentioned yesterday that the planned entry is a CMC-guided entry, so I'm kind just curious as how are we going to get the alignment.
096:22:09|C|Kerwin|Did you say how we're going to get guidance? Over.
096:22:14|T|CMP|No. How are we going to get a platform alignment?
096:22:18|C|Kerwin|Okay. We got a number of interesting ideas on that and the latest one I've heard is to power up the LM platform and align it, and align the CM platform to it.
096:22:32|T|CMP|Okay. That sounds good.
096:22:34|C|Kerwin|Okay. And we're working out detailed procedures on that, Jack.
096:22:39|T|CMP|Okay.
096:37:01|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
096:37:06|T|CMP|Go ahead, Joe.
096:37:07|C|Kerwin|Okay. We are taking our final look at the midcourse procedures and we have a question as to the present position of one of the switches. The switch is the AGS STATUS switch on panel 6. We'd just like to know where it's at.
096:37:27|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by.
096:37:44|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. The AGS STATUS switch is OFF.
096:37:47|C|Kerwin|Okay. OFF. Thank you.
096:53:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 96 hours 53 minutes ground elapsed time. Spacecraft communicator Vance Brand has relieved Joe Kerwin at that post, the spacecraft communicators on a different shift schedule than the rest of the Flight Controllers. To go back again, once over lightly with the midcourse correction upcoming. Repeat the current thinking is to do a midcourse correction burn at 105 hours 30 minutes ground elapsed time, the descent propulsion system of the Lunar Module would do the burn - the velocity change would be 7.6 feet per second. This burn would place the Apollo 13 spacecraft back on the entry corridor for entry into the South Central Pacific. Another aspect of timing the maneuver at 105:30 instead of the earlier discussed 104 hours, is that it is expected that super-critical helium burst disk in the lunar module descent stage is likely to let go at about - about this time frame 105:30 and by doing the maneuver and the - and having the burst disk rupture at this time would put both of these events close together so it wouldn't be expecting the burst disk to go which in turn may or may not effect the trajectory as far as tracking concerns, so this would get them both behind and an accurate tracking state vector of the spacecraft could be measured. It's expected that the new thinking on the midcourse correction will be passed up to the crew before too long.
096:56:33|P|PAO|The midcourse correction burn made earlier at 79 hours and 28 minutes transferred Apollo 13 from a hybrid nonfree return trajectory to a free return trajectory. The next maneuver at pericynthion plus two hours transferred back from one free return to another with a change in the landing point and landing time. We're continuing to stand by. The velocity now showing 4,068 feet per second as Apollo 13 continues to accelerate, now that it is back into the Earths sphere of influence. Some 172,937 miles out from Earth. At 96 hours 57 minutes ground elapsed time and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
097:14:26|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
097:14:37|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
097:14:42|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. I just heard a little thump, sounded like down in the descent stage, and I saw a new shower of snow flakes come up that looked like they were emitted from down that way. We've already decided though - I wonder what the SUPERCRIT pressure looked like now.
097:15:02|C|Brand|Okay. Understand you saw a thump in the descent stage and a few snow flakes. We'll take a look down here, see if we see anything.
097:15:46|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
097:16:06|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
097:16:10|T|LMP|Go ahead.
097:16:12|C|Brand|Fred, we don't see anything wrong. For example, your SHe appears to be okay as far as we can see. The thing we don't have data on, is the start tank down there.
097:16:30|T|LMP|Okay. And I doubt if it would have been that anyway.
097:16:35|C|Brand|Okay. While we have you on the horn  -
097:16:37|T|LMP|We're still getting  -
097:16:42|C|Brand|Roger. Still getting it.
097:16:43|T|LMP|Go ahead.
097:16:45|C|Brand|While you're on the horn, be advised our calculations show you might be running out of potable water in the CSM pretty soon. Also, that you might start to have hydrogen tank venting in the CSM and a question. Next time Jack looks through the sextant and telescope, we'd like him to see how it looks. Do you have anything on the optics, any specks or anything?
097:17:20|T|LMP|Okay, ...
097:20:05|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?
097:20:09|C|Brand|Aquarius, we read you 4 by 4. Go ahead.
097:20:15|T|LMP|Okay. It looks like the PTC is deteriorated enough that ... the docking window of the LM, and ... we're just going to completely lose
097:20:55|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. We got part of your transmission. Understand the PTC has deteriorated quite a bit and you'd like to know what to do about it. Is that affirm?
097:21:10|T|LMP|Negative. How do you read now, Vance?
097:21:12|C|Brand|Okay. A little better.
097:21:16|T|LMP|Okay. The only comment was that it has deteriorated to where the Moon is now coming through the overhead docking window now, in a portion of each pass, and about that time I just lose COMM on either antenna, so there's going to be a short period of time on each revolution where we're not going to have COMM.
097:21:38|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. We understand that and one more item for clarification on the water. We don't really know what your usage of potable is. That was purely an estimate assuming a fairly healthy usage.
097:21:57|T|LMP|Okay.
097:24:14|T|LMP|Hey, Houston; Aquarius.
097:24:20|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
097:24:25|T|LMP|Okay. Jack just took a look through the optics - through one REV, and he said they look good, loud and clear. He doesn't have any current condensate on either the sextant or telescope.
097:24:40|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. Thanks for the info.
097:36:07|T|LMP|How do you read, Vance?
097:36:11|C|Brand|Okay. I'm reading you weakly, Fred. Go ahead.
097:36:17|T|LMP|With all this other procedures you've been working on there, I thought I was going to have a new one for you. How to get four gingerbread cubes apart; I think they were stuck together with epoxy.
097:36:53|C|Brand|This is in the food bag?
097:36:59|T|LMP|Yes.
097:37:01|C|Brand|That's to stand loads of launch and boost.
097:37:07|T|LMP|Roger. Tool B did the trick.
097:37:28|T|LMP|Yes.
097:37:34|C|Brand|Hey, Fred. John says you can use the dikes on it to get them apart.
097:37:42|T|LMP|Yes, that probably wouldn't have crumbled them as badly.
097:37:49|T|LMP|I generally don't use the subtle approach. You can tell we're feeling pretty good, Vance, when we start complaining about the food.
097:37:58|C|Brand|Yes. That's good to hear.
097:38:11|C|Brand|I think everybody's feeling better down here, too,
097:41:15|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
097:41:20|T|LMP|Go ahead.
097:41:21|C|Brand|Fred, we have you on the Goldstone big dish now, and our COMM is much better. If you'd like would you turn the BIOMED switch on to either crewman there.
097:41:36|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by. I'll have to plug in first.
097:41:38|C|Brand|Okay.
097:42:03|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. How do you read on baseband.
097:42:08|C|Brand|We read you just - Stand by.
097:43:02|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. We're receiving your MED data; it was a little slow in coming in.
097:43:09|T|LMP|Okay.
098:23:04|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius. Are you calling?
098:23:08|C|Brand|Negative. No call from here.
098:23:13|T|LMP|Okay.
098:26:14|T|LMP|And, Vance, this is Aquarius.
098:26:19|C|Brand|Go ahead, Fred.
098:26:23|T|LMP|Okay. Jim's coming back on the line, and I'll be unhooking on the BIOMEDs, and you want us to go back to the SPA DOWN VOICE BACKUP?
098:26:44|C|Brand|Stand by.
098:26:48|T|LMP|Okay. Jim doesn't have his BIOMED rigged on right now, so I'm looking at ... DOWN VOICE BACKUP SPA.
098:27:07|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. You're too weak on that last. I understand you're disconnecting, and your BIOMED will be off. Say again about Jim, please.
098:27:24|T|LMP|Okay. How do you read now?
098:27:26|C|Brand|Okay.
098:27:30|T|LMP|Okay. All I said was Jim doesn't have his BIOMED rigged right now so I'll go back to DOWN VOICE BACKUP SPA and Jim's coming on the line.
098:27:49|C|Brand|Okay. We copy you're in DOWN VOICE BACKUP.
098:28:53|T|CDR|Well, I'm thinking about the last 10 hours. We've lost our suit compressors.
098:29:02|T|CDR|Because we don't want to use the power.
098:29:18|T|CDR|Well, that's what I'm saying. We can use these fans right here and use the circulate air right through the use of those fans.
098:29:34|T|CDR|Are we hot mike now?
098:29:45|T|CDR|Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
098:29:49|C|Brand|Roger, Jim. Good morning.
098:29:53|T|CDR|Good morning, Vance. How's things going down there?
098:29:56|C|Brand|Oh, quiet and smooth.
098:30:03|T|CDR|Oh, it's afternoon down there.
098:30:06|C|Brand|Right. We thought maybe it was morning to you.
098:30:12|T|CDR|Well, I've sort of lost track. But I had a good sleep.
098:30:17|C|Brand|Glad to hear it. Doctor just said he wondered how many hours?
098:30:29|T|CDR|Oh, let's say whenever I left Jack, and Fred came on and we ate for about an hour, and then I went to bed, so whatever that time was. It must be about 5 hours, something like that; 4 or 5 hours.
098:30:42|C|Brand|Good. Glad to see you catching up.
098:31:42|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
098:31:50|T|CDR|Go ahead, Vance.
098:31:51|C|Brand|Jim, the next time that it's convenient, could you get the readout of the REPRESS package in the command module for us? Over.
098:32:02|T|CDR|Will do.
098:32:04|C|Brand|Okay.
098:32:08|T|CDR|When you go back there, Fred, they want the REPRESS package readout.
098:32:15|C|Brand|We don't want you to wake anyone up to get it.
098:32:21|T|CDR|No. No one's asleep now.
098:33:37|T|CDR|It has? It isn't the Sun angle is it? Looking through here, you get forward to it and a pretty good view of the venting.
098:34:13|T|CDR|And, Houston, Aquarius. It looks like service module venting has ceased, at least momentarily.
098:34:19|C|Brand|Roger. Understand service module venting has ceased momentarily. How about the descent stage? Does Fred report venting down there? Do you still see that?
098:34:33|T|CDR|Stand by.
098:34:36|T|CDR|What is your report on descent stage venting - Was it venting? Anything else going on? Any more venting?
098:34:51|T|CDR|Oh.
098:34:52|T|CDR|No. Fred hasn't seen anything else from the descent stage. And I understand that we can expect the - the SHe - tank pressure to build up to relief here about 105 hours.
098:35:06|C|Brand|Roger. A little later than that - like 106 - 107.
098:35:13|T|CDR|Okay.
098:35:43|T|CDR|Did you get some interior photos?
098:35:48|T|CDR|Yes.
098:35:52|T|CDR|Okay. I'd like to show them the arrangement of these hydroxide canisters. Do you have?
098:36:10|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
098:37:11|T|CDR|Did they give Jack any more procedures on command module powerup?
098:37:16|T|LMP|...
098:37:18|T|CDR|Did they give Jack any more procedures on command module powerup?
098:39:04|T|CDR|Well, they think it might be up here.
098:39:06|T|LMP|Okay.
098:39:08|T|CDR|The main thing we got to think about, and when we have to get to them, is the procedures for LM jettison, the transfer of the LM to CSM mode (cough), LM jettison.
098:39:23|T|LMP|...
098:39:24|T|CDR|Yes.
098:40:33|T|CDR|... the LM mode?
098:41:17|T|CDR|All we have to do is turn the BIOMED ... on, and we'll be in there.
098:41:34|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
098:41:39|C|Brand|Roger. Go ahead, Aquarius.
098:41:44|T|CDR|We would like permission to turn the BIOMED on to get off the hot mike mode. I don't think that we have to be on it now if you have the big dish on, do you?
098:42:05|T|CDR|Yes. Yaw's coming - or roll's coming up for it, way we're going to burn.
098:42:13|C|Brand|Roger, Jim. We concur. Go ahead and turn it on.
098:42:18|T|CDR|Okay. Fine; thank you.
098:42:22|C|Brand|One other point. The philosophy of timing this midcourse is based a little bit on doing it just before the SHe tank is supposed to vent. That way, we hope that we would have - be powered up and you would have control when the venting occurs, in case you were tossed around a little bit. Over.
098:42:45|T|CDR|Okay. Understand. Philosophy on the midcourse is doing it, prior to venting of the SHe tank, which means we'll be doing this around 105 hours, I suppose, or 105:30 and so I'll have control of the spacecraft if it should give us some perturbation.
098:43:06|C|Brand|Roger. Then, after that, we would establish PTC again.
098:43:16|T|CDR|Roger.
098:48:01|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
098:48:05|C|Brand|Go ahead, Aquarius.
098:48:09|T|CDR|Our REPRESS package pressure is 820.
098:48:14|C|Brand|Okay. REPRESS pressure 820. Thank you.
098:49:03|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 98 hours 49 minutes. EECOM says that repress package pressure is good, it's about where he would expect to see it. He was pleased with that 820 pounds per square inch reading. The repress package consists of three one pound oxygen bottles, in the command module. It's used to quickly repressurize the command module after it has been depressurized. The name repress comes from repressurization. In addition to these three one pound bottles of oxygen in the command module, the surge tank contains an additional three pounds of oxygen for the command module. Flight Director, Gerry Griffin, and his Gold team have relieved Glenn Lunney and his Black team. He has no estimate yet on the time for the change of shift briefing. We'll continue to stand by for live air-ground transmission.
098:54:17|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
098:54:23|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
098:54:26|C|Brand|Jim, could you switch your BIOMED switch to the position opposite to where it is now? We are getting a subcarrier, but no data. Over.
098:54:45|T|CDR|Now you know, Houston, I don't have BIOMED on.
098:54:53|C|Brand|Okay. And we have a small addition to the procedure that was read up to you earlier, which involves power transfer from the LM to the CSM.
098:55:17|T|CDR|Stand by 1.
098:55:19|C|Brand|Okay.
098:55:59|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Go ahead.
098:56:02|C|Brand|Okay. At the end of the procedure, after the step BAT 5 and 6, OFF, add the following: circuit breakers, panel - panels 11 and 16, ASCENT ECA CONTROL, both open. Over.
098:56:37|T|CDR|Okay. After the step BAT 5 and 6, OFF, step 3 will be circuit breakers panels 11 and 16 ASCENT ECA CONTROL, both open.
098:56:50|C|Brand|That's correct, Jim. And this is to guard against a single-point failure that - a remote possibility that would preclude you from getting the batteries back on.
098:57:04|T|CDR|Roger,
098:58:20|C|Brand|Go ahead.
099:01:17|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 99 hours, 1 minute. Apollo 13 now is 167,992 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 4,154 feet per second. As you heard on air-ground, we do intend to - play the ignition time for the midcourse correction rather loosely. Basing it on the predicted supercritical helium tank burst disk going as the pressure in that tank rises to the point where it will burst the disk and vent the helium overboard. However, we burned the descent propulsion engine which is pressurized by this helium enough times now that - we have enough helium entrapped in the propellant tanks - known as blowdown capability or ullage capability, for 800 feet per second DELTA-V so there will be no problem in - in loosing the - the remainder of the helium from the helium tank. Based on a prediction of 106 hours at the present time for the helium tank relieving, we would expect to do the burn somewhere around 105-1/2 hours. If the helium tank relieves earlier than predicted, we would do the burn as quickly after that as operationally possible. We'd like to keep - to do the burn within a half an hour of the tank pressure relieving, if possible. This is a non-propulsive venting, but it will probably cause some attitude excursions, and they would like to have the spacecraft powered up with the crew in control of the - Aquarius when the venting occurs.
099:03:58|P|PAO|The midcourse correction itself will be a straight forward maneuver, estimated right now that it will be on the order of 7 to 8 feet per second. About a 15 second burn, using - the descent propulsion system. We'll use the AGS or the secondary guidance system backup guidance system of the Lunar Module for this burn. The AGS takes less power than PGNS and we would like to hold the power usage down. And this burn is well within the capability of the AGS as far as accuracy. We will probably burn on time rather than velocity acheived. It will be done with the throttle in the minimum position. The Flight Director Gerry Griffin has been taking a status report from his Flight Controllers. The CO2 lithium hydroxide procedure worked out with the hoses and the - the makeshift method to run the cabin air pass the Command Module, lithium hydroxide cannisters appears to be working very well. The CO<sub>2</sub> in the cabin is now up to only 2/10 of a - of millimeters of mercury. Based on present usage rates we have enough water to last until an elapsed time of 165 hours 14 minutes. The water rate will go up slightly during - during burns. We expect to use about 7 pounds of water for midcourse. We have enough oxygen to last until an elapsed time of 273 hours 27 minutes, under the present usage rates. And enough electrical power for 209 hours 8 minutes. We calculate we have enough lithium hydroxide for 100 - for 164 hours from now, that is not a GET time, we have enough remaining for 164 hours. All of these consumables are well above what is required for a 142 hours elapsed time landing.
099:17:13|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 99 hours 17 minutes, Flight Director Glynn Lunney has left the Control Center for the Building 1 Auditorium and the News Conference. I repeat, Flight Director Glynn Lunney is on his way to the MSC Auditorium for the Change of Shift News Conference.
099:49:43|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
099:49:47|C|Young|Go ahead, Jim.
099:49:52|T|CDR|Okay. We just had a battery warning light. Battery 2.
099:50:07|C|Slayton|Stand by, Jim. The COMM's no good here right now.
099:50:20|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. How do you read now?
099:50:23|C|Young|Go ahead. Loud and clear.
099:50:26|T|CDR|Okay. We just had a battery warning MASTER ALARM, and it looks like it's battery 2.
099:50:38|C|Young|Roger.
099:50:48|C|Young|Roger, Houston - This is Houston. Could you close the POWER AMP circuit breaker, and we'll get some high bit rate?
099:50:56|T|CDR|Roger.
099:51:08|T|CDR|It's closed.
099:51:09|C|Young|Okay. And we need high bit rate.
099:51:49|T|CDR|Are you picking it up, Houston?
099:51:53|C|Young|Roger. And we want to open the BAL LOAD CROSS TIE on panel 16. Over.
099:52:00|T|CDR|Say again.
099:52:01|C|Young|Open the BAL LOAD CROSS TIE breaker on panel 16. Over.
099:52:08|T|CDR|Open BALANCE LOAD CROSS TIE breaker on 16. Roger.
099:52:11|C|Young|That's affirm.
099:52:13|T|CDR|It's open.
099:53:12|T|CDR|If you're getting high bit data, we could do an OFF/RESET and go back on battery 2. We're standing by for that.
099:53:12|C|Young|... Longer.
099:53:29|C|Young|Okay. Could you turn off battery 2, and leave it off and let us look at it?
099:53:36|T|CDR|Say again. You want us to turn off battery 2, and leave it off until you look at it?
099:53:39|C|Young|That's affirmative.
099:53:42|T|CDR|Okay. Battery 2 coming off the line.
099:54:27|C|Young|Okay, Aquarius. So you want to stay in this configuration for awhile, and let's look at the battery.
099:54:34|T|CDR|Roger. We'll stay in this configuration.
099:54:41|C|Young|Want to close the BAL LOADS circuit breaker back now.
099:55:00|C|Young|13, Houston. We want to close the BAL LOADS circuit breaker on panel 16 now, again.
099:55:08|T|CDR|We have it closed; the closed - BALANCE LOADS circuit breaker is closed.
099:55:13|C|Young|Rog.
099:55:41|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Request RANGE FUNCTIONS switch to RANGE please.
099:55:49|T|CDR|All right. RANGE FUNCTIONS switch going to RANGE.
099:55:53|C|Brand|Right-o.
099:57:33|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
099:57:49|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
099:57:54|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
099:57:56|C|Brand|Jim, on the battery problem, we have determined that it is not overcurrent or reverse current. We suspect it's over-temp, but don't know for sure, so we're going to watch it for awhile.
099:58:12|T|CDR|Okay.
100:00:20|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
100:00:25|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
100:00:27|C|Brand|Jim, Charlie has some procedures to read up for you here; I think you'll need your activation checklist, if it's handy.
100:00:38|C|Duke|Aquarius, that's the contingency checklist.
100:00:40|T|CDR|Okay. I'll just - Okay. Stand by, Charlie.
100:01:12|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. I've got the contingency checklist, and standing by.
100:01:16|C|Duke|Okay, Jim. We'd like you to turn to page - page 24, which is the "30-Minute Activation," and this is going to be a procedure for the midcourse burn that we got coming up at 105 with the AGS up. Over.
100:01:36|T|CDR|Roger. On the midcourse at 105, and I'm on page 24.
100:01:41|C|Duke|Okay; "30-Minute Activation," omit steps 1, 2, and 3; perform step 4, "RCS system A/B-2." Over.
100:01:58|T|CDR|Roger. Omit steps 1, 2, and 3; perform step 4.
100:02:03|C|Duke|Roger. And on the "EPS Activation," same page, perform step 1; and in step 2, perform line number - line number 6, "EPS DISPLAY-CLOSE." Over.
100:02:28|T|CDR|Okay. On "EPS Activation," perform step l, and perform step 2, line 6 only; is that correct?
100:02:37|C|Duke|That's affirmative, Jim. The rest of the stuff is already closed at this time, so that's all we'll have to do is close the EPS DISPLAY breaker.
100:02:57|T|CDR|Okay.
100:02:58|C|Duke|All right. Turn to page 25. On page 25, omit step 3; perform step 4. On step 4, last line, scratch "CB(16) EPS: INVERTER 2, closed." Over.
100:03:25|T|CDR|Roger. Omit step 3; perform step 4, except for the last line. Circuit breaker 16, EPS INVERTER 2, closed.
100:03:34|C|Duke|Roger. That's correct. On step 5, perform step 5. Under "Primary Glycol Loop Activation," step 1, line 1, "CB(16) ECS: DISPLAY - CLOSE." That's a crew option; you can have it if you want to. Omit the rest of step 1 and step 2. Perform step 3. Over.
100:04:11|T|CDR|Okay. On primary glycol loop activation, crew option on step 1, first line; the rest of it we'll omit. Step 2, we'll omit, and we'll do step 3.
100:04:27|C|Duke|That's affirmative, Jim, with the following DELTAs on step 3, and if you'll turn to page 26, I'll give you the DELTAs on the activation circuit breaker list. Over.
100:04:43|T|CDR|Okay. I'm there.
100:04:45|C|Duke|Roger. On line 1, correction, row 1, under AC BUS A: TAPE RECORDER should be open; DECA GIMBAL, open. All the other ones as shown on the page. Over.
100:05:12|T|CDR|Okay. On row 1, AC BUS A: TAPE RECORDER and DECA GIMBAL will be open. All the rest as shown.
100:05:20|C|Duke|Roger. And we don't know the status of your windows. If you - During this burn, we're going to have to look out the forward window to get the alinement with the COAS, so you might need the commander window heater and you can, of course, use that breaker if needed, since we do have the AC power. On row 2 - Go ahead. Over.
100:05:46|T|CDR|I don't think we'll need it, Charlie.
100:05:47|C|Duke|Okay; fine, Jim. On row 2, under RCS SYSTEM A: ASCENT FEED 2 and ASCENT FEED 1 should be open. Under FLIGHT DISPLAYS: MISSION TIMER should be open; GASTA, open; ORDEAL, open. Under AC BUS A: GASTA, open. The rest are as shown on the page. Over.
100:06:28|T|CDR|Okay. On row 2, we're going to open up ASCENT FEED 2 and ASCENT FEED 1 under RCS SYSTEM A. We're going to open up the MISSION TIMER, and FLIGHT DISPLAYS: the GASTA and the ORDEAL; and the AC BUS A: the GASTA.
100:06:46|C|Duke|That's affirmative. Okay. Row 3, under PROPELLANT: DESCENT HELIUM REG/VENT should be open. Under HEATERS: RENDEZVOUS RADAR STANDBY, open; LANDING RADAR, open. Under STAB/CONTROL: ATCA (PGNS), open. Under ED and LIGHTING: all four open. Over.
100:07:35|T|CDR|Okay. Row 3, under PROPELLANT - propulsion: the DESCENT HELIUM REG/VENT will be open: the STANDBY RENDEZVOUS HEATER will be open and the LANDING RADAR HEATER circuit breaker will be open. I just changed antennas; and, keeping on down the line, ATCA PGNS will be open and the last four circuit breakers, two under ED and two under LIGHTING, will be open.
100:08:07|C|Duke|That's affirmative. Okay. Under row 4, under ECS: GLYCOL PUMP AUTO TRANSFER, close. Under COMM: UP DATA LINK, open; VHF B and VHF A should he open. Under PGNS: LGC/DSKY, open; IMU OPERATE, open. Over.
100:08:50|T|CDR|Okay. Under row 4, the AUTO TRANSFER will be close. UPDATA LINK, open; VHF A and B, open; DSKY, open; and IMU OPERATE, open.
100:09:09|C|Duke|That's affirm. On the last row, the only DELTA is under the CROSS TIE BUS and it should be open. Over.
100:09:20|T|CDR|Say that again, Charlie.
100:09:22|C|Duke|Okay. Under the last row, under EPS is the only DELTA and that is under the CROSS TIE BUS. It should go open. Over.
100:09:34|T|CDR|Roger. The CROSS TIE BUS should go open.
100:09:38|C|Duke|That's affirm. Going on to page 27, Activation, panel 16. Under RCS SYSTEM Bravo: ASCENT FEED 1, ASCENT FEED 2 should be open. Under PROPULSION: PQGS should be open; ASCENT HELIUM REG, open. Over.
100:10:12|T|CDR|Okay. Line 1, on panel 16, ASCENT FEEDs 1 and 2 will be open. And the PQGS will be open, and the ASCENT HELIUM REG will be open.
100:10:24|C|Duke|That's affirmative. On the next three rows, we only get the nine DELTAs, so I'll go through the next three rows completely and then you can read those back. Under LIGHTING  -
100:10:36|T|CDR|Okay.
100:10:37|C|Duke|Under LIGHTING; FLOOD, open; TRACK, open. Under ED LOGIC - Correction, under ED: LOGIC, open. Under STAB/CONTROL: DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE, open. Under ECS: SUIT FLOW CONTROL, open. Under row 3, COMM: DISPLAY, open; VHF A TRANSMITTER open; VHF B RECEIVER, open. Under ECS: DISPLAY, that's crew option. Last row, under EPS: INVERTER 2, open. Over.
100:11:45|T|CDR|Okay. On the last three rows, we have FLOOD and TRACK circuit breakers, row 2, open; LOGIC POWER B, open; DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE, open; SUIT FLOW CONTROL, open. On the third row - row, DISPLAY, open; VHF A and - VHF - VHF A TRANSMIITTER, open; VHF B RECEIVER, open. And under ECS: we have DISPLAY, open, at crew option. And the last one, INVERTER 2 under EPS, will be open.
100:12:23|C|Duke|Roger. That's a good readback. Under that ECS DISPLAY, it shows it closed. If, with it closed, you can have some readout of - onboard readout of your ECS system - draws a lot less than a half amp so it's up to you whether you want it or not. Okay, on page 28.
100:12:42|T|CDR|Roger.
100:12:44|C|Duke|On page 28, step - perform step 4 with the following changes in the warning light status. Under the warning lights, you will probably - you will have ASCENT PRESSURE and an LGC light. Scratch "RCS A and RCS B REG." Under caution lights, you'll have a PRE AMPS light. Over.
100:13:20|T|CDR|Roger. Under warning, we'll have ASCENT PRESSURE and LGC; and under caution, we'll have a PRE AMP.
100:13:27|C|Duke|Affirmative. Under VHF/S-band Activation and Checkout, scratch step 1. Under step 2, change DOWN VOICE BACKUP to VOICE. Scratch step 3. Under PGNS turn on, scratch entire procedure. Under DAP Set/Gimbal Drive, scratch entire procedure. Over.
100:14:13|T|CDR|Okay. Under VHF/S-band Activation and Checkout, scratch step 1. Do step 2 with the following change, DOWN VOICE BACKUP to VOICE. Scratch step 3. Scratch the entire remaining events that page. Over.
100:14:32|C|Duke|That's affirmative, Jim, Going on to page 29. We've got - At this point, there is a write-in required. It's about a six or seven liner, and I'll try to go fairly slowly and let you write it down, if you're ready to copy. Over.
100:15:03|T|CDR|Ready to copy.
100:15:05|C|Duke|Okay. At this point, we'd like you to Verify RCS heaters in AUTO for 15 minutes.
100:15:19|T|CDR|Is that the first step, Charlie?
100:15:20|C|Duke|That's affirmative. What we're trying to do here is we're getting you set up in an attitude so you can damp your rates and come out of PTC. And this is the configuration I'm reading you now, the next - in the next six lines, the procedure for getting you into a configuration to damp the rates and stop PTC. Over.
100:15:43|T|CDR|Okay. So the first thing will be to - Go to AUTO on the RCS SYSTEM A and B?
100:15:50|C|Duke|It's the Verify that the heaters have been in AUTO for 15 minutes. Back on the first page of this procedure, you put the heaters in AUTO and you pushed the breakers in, and we'd like for them to warm up the quads for 15 minutes before we start to - stop at - stopping PTC. Over.
100:16:12|T|CDR|Roger, Verify heaters RCS on for 15 minutes.
100:16:16|C|Duke|Okay. Step 2: BALANCE COUPLE, OFF; DEAD BAND, MINIMUM; ATTITUDE CONTROL: PITCH and ROLL to PULSE; YAW to DIRECT; MODE CONTROL: AGS, ATT HOLD; GUIDANCE CONTROL to AGS; damp rates; pitch and roll with the TTCA, yaw with the ACA with the Earth in the front window. Over.
100:17:45|T|CDR|Okay, let's see if I got it. Step 2 is BALANCE COUPLE's OFF; DEAD BAND, MIN; ATTITUDE CONTROL: PITCH and YAW at PULSE; YAW, DIRECT. MODE CONTROL will be in AGS, ATT HOLD; GUIDANCE CONTROL will be in AGS; we'll damp the rates; pitch and roll with the TTCA, and yaw with the ACA; and we'll probably have to have some reference point, so I have to try and stop on the Earth. Over.
100:18:14|C|Duke|Roger, Jim. We were hoping that in your PTC that you occasionally see the Earth coming through the window; and, if that's true, then we'd like you to have to - just damp the rates with the Earth in the forward window. And then we'll give you the burn attitude via the forward window on the Earth momentarily. Over.
100:18:44|T|CDR|Roger.
100:18:46|C|Duke|Okay that was the entire procedure for damping the rates, only - though I only gave you - said it was step 2, that was the entire procedure. Now, continuing on to what's printed on page 29 - Correction, you had one error in the readback under ATTITUDE CONTROL. It was PITCH and ROLL to PULSE; YAW to DIRECT. Continuing on, on page 29 with the printed procedure, the first four lines, scratch. Step 3, scratch. Under AGS Activation, one change: add a step. First step will be Verify ASA CB(16) in for 10 minutes. The rest of the AGS activation is as printed. Over.
100:20:02|T|CDR|Okay. Verify ASA circuit breaker 16 in for 10 minutes; and, I take it, 10 minutes back in our procedures we'll have a note saying to put that in.
100:20:14|C|Duke|It's - the circuit breaker goes it on the circuit breaker activation page, Jim. So, by the time we get here and have the rates all damped, we feel that - that the PIPAs will be up to temperature by this time, and we can go ahead and turn it - turn the AGS on at this time. Over. But we just want you to verify that.
100:20:36|T|CDR|Okay. And one other question, Charlie. I'd like to know if the note you gave me about damping the rates is before the other information on page 29.
100:20:49|C|Duke|That's affirmative. Add that in to the top of the page. The - What we're really doing - Let's - let's put it in to right before the AGS Activation. The other - the other procedure on the top of the page belongs with the DAP Set Gimbal Trim, and we're just omitting all of that procedure. So the addition that - on the damping, the rates should really go in right before the AGS Activation. Over.
100:21:20|T|CDR|Understand.
100:21:22|C|Duke|What we're really trying to do is get you in a posture so that when you see the Earth come through the window, you can damp her out and hold - hold the Earth in the window. Proceeding on to the rest of page 29, under RCS PRESS, scratch the entire three steps as printed. On page 30, scratch step 4 under the RCS PRESS. Over.
100:21:55|T|CDR|Roger. Under AGS Activation, well, I included that step on the ASA circuit breaker and we'll do step 1 and 2 ander AGS Activation. But then we'll scratch steps 1, 2, and 3 under RCS PRESS and, on page 30, we'll scratch step 4.
100:22:12|C|Duke|Affirm. Under DPS PRESS, step 1, line 1, scratch. Line 4, DESCENT HELIUM REG 1, talkback barber pole. Under step 2, scratch; step 3, scratch; LANDING GEAR DEPLOY, scratch. Over.
100:22:47|T|CDR|Okay. Under DPS PRESS, we'll scratch the first line and we'll have the DESCENT HELIUM REG, talkback to barber pole. We'll scratch steps 2 and 3, and we'll scratch the LANDING GEAR DEPLOY.
100:23:03|C|Duke|Roger. Now we got, on the back of page 30, Jim, you've got a blank page in your checklist, or should have, and we'd like to add a procedure to get you to burn attitude. Over.
100:23:20|T|CDR|Okay. A procedure to get the burn attitude.
100:23:24|C|Duke|Okay. First statement is a statement: Verify AGS in OPERATE for 5 minutes. Then we go to AGS address 400 plus 5, then 400 plus zero. ATTITUDE CONTROL: PITCH and ROLL to PULSE; YAW, MODE CONTROL. Maneuver using TTCA pitch and roll. The computer is controlling yaw, but you can override with ACA. You with me? Over.
100:25:08|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. I'm with you so far.
100:25:11|C|Duke|Okay, Jim. When in attitude, ACA out of detent to zero error needle. Then set EVENT TIMER, and we'll give you a countdown on that when you get to that step. Over.
100:25:52|T|CDR|Okay. When in attitude, ACA out of detent to null needles, and set DET.
100:25:58|C|Duke|Roger. Now, that - the burn attitude will be coming up on a PAD, but, basically, we're looking for a local horizontal retrograde burn, which means, using a COAS, if you put the horizontal line on the COAS on the horns of the Earth and then roll to place the X-axis in the direction of the Sun, we'll - that will put us in both burn attitude; and you can check that via the Sun which will be in the AOT detent 2. Should lie right along the cursor at the top. We'll have some more words for you momentarily. I'd like to go on to page 31 if you're ready. Over.
100:27:01|T|CDR|Okay. I figure I have a handle on the attitude, the way the Earth should look in the COAS, and you're going to give me some words on what the Sun would look like in the AOT. Is that right?
100:27:14|C|Duke|That's affirmative, Jim. We haven't got a picture of it yet. It's going to be in the top part of the COAS - Correction, top part of the AOT at the top of the - the top of detent 2 and the top part of the AOT, and it should, in attitude, if you're right on the Sun, should split the cursor, though that roll angle is not too critical; if we're in about 10 degrees, we'll be okay. We - but I think - we think you should be able to get it better than that. On page 31, under the "DPS Burn Technique," you can scratch the bottom part below the little diagram there since the gimbal is locked. Over.
100:28:07|T|CDR|Understand scratch the bottom part underneath the diagram because the gimbal is locked.
100:28:12|C|Duke|That's affirmative; and, since the gimbal was trimmed out at the big burn yesterday, we should be still through the c.g., and we'd like to make sure that Jack sits in the same place for this burn that he did yesterday. That way, we'll - you should have no trouble controlling attitude. Now I'm ready to go over to page 32. Over.
100:28:42|T|CDR|Okay. Let me see if I have that right, now. You want Jack to sit in the same attitude so that the gimbals are the same place so you don't have trouble controlling attitude. I got it.
100:28:50|C|Duke|Okay. Now on page 32, top of the page, first line, scratch VERB 76. Third line, MODE CONTROL: AGS, ATT HOLD. At Minus 6 minutes, scratch lines 1, 2, and at Burn Attitude, scratch VERB 40 NOUN 20. Scratch lines 2, 3, and 4. Now at Burn Attitude, we want you to do a 400 plus 5 and then a VERB - a 400 plus zero. And we have a caution note at this point. Over.
100:29:57|T|CDR|Go ahead.
100:29:59|C|Duke|Okay. The caution is after 400 plus zero: Do not go out of detent on ACA again. Over.
100:30:33|T|CDR|Okay. After the last 400 plus zero, Do not go out of detent with ACA. Is that correct?
100:30:38|C|Duke|That's a Roger, Jim. What happens is, of course, we set - when you go out of detent, you reset the AGS error needles and you - and you lose your attitude reference. You establish a new attitude reference, and it might not be the burn attitude since, at this point, we're controlling attitude with the TTCA. Now, picking up with the VERB 37, ENTER, scratch. Scratch everything down to the 404 plus zero, and we want you to perform those AGS steps with 404 down through 470. Over.
100:31:23|T|CDR|Okay. We'll scratch everything down to 404 plus zero, and we'll perform those four steps.
100:31:29|C|Duke|Rog. Turning over to page 33. Minus 4 minutes. Okay. Moving down the page, it's about line 7, to ENGINE GIMBAL: ENGINE GIMBAL, OFF. Down to MODE CONTROL, make that read MODE CONTROL: AGS, ATT HOLD, and then scratch PROPELLANT QUANTITY MONITOR, DESCENT 1. Over.
100:32:16|T|CDR|Okay. At 4 minutes, ENGINE GIMBAL will be OFF; MODE CONTROL will be to AGS, ATT HOLD; PROPELLANT QUANTITY MONITOR, DESCENT 1, scratched.
100:32:27|C|Duke|Rog. Picking up at minus 1 minute, scratch MASTER ARM, ON. Minus 35 seconds, scratch first two lines. At minus 10 seconds, change that to Minus 9 seconds; so, at Minus 9 seconds, it will be Manual Ullage. At 2 seconds, scratch CMC MODE, FREE, and scratch ACA out of detent. At - after IGNITION, at plus 1 second, Terminate Ullage. Are you with me? Over.
100:33:36|T|CDR|Okay. At 1 minute, MASTER ARM, we scratch. At 35 seconds, scratch the first two lines. Manual Ullage will start at 9 seconds; we're scratching the box at 02 seconds; and the line beneath that, at plus 1 second, we Terminate Ullage.
100:33:56|C|Duke|That's affirm. Picking up at plus 5 seconds; scratch the rest of the page. TTCA, attitude control; and MASTER ARM, OFF. Over.
100:34:14|T|CDR|Scratch the remainder of the page.
100:34:18|C|Duke|Okay. Now, like to verify that under the 35 seconds, minus 35 seconds, the only thing you have remaining is ENGINE ARM to DESCENT. Over.
100:34:30|T|CDR|That's affirm. That's the only thing I have.
100:34:32|C|Duke|Okay. Turning to the next page and the last page, Jim, 34. Top of the page, Monitor DELTA-V<sub>x</sub> via 470. Scratch next two lines, When propellant quantity equals 37 and the DESCENT HELIUM REG. Scratch TTCA commander, reduce to 10 percent. Now we want you to add a line; shut - It's a shutdown criteria, shutdown on burn time minus 1 second. Over.
100:35:35|T|CDR|Okay, The shutdown is on burn time minus 1 second. Let me give you an example. If we have a 30-second burn, we're going to shut down at 29 seconds. Is that correct?
100:35:47|C|Duke|That's affirmative. We'll give you the PAD, be coming up here from FIDO in a couple of hours, I guess, when we stabilize out on our tracking. The reason for - If you're ready to copy out a couple of more steps, and then I'll explain the reason we want to shut down on this burn time minus 1 second. Picking up on When DELTA-V<sub>x</sub>  -
100:36:09|T|CDR|Okay.
100:36:10|C|Duke|-  When DELTA-V<sub>x</sub> equal to the final DELTA-V<sub>x</sub>, scratch that line. Scratch ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to PULSE. Add - Correction, scratch Damp excessive rates via LM Y, Z translation and add at that point Null error needles. Trim address 470 to 0.1 foot per second. Over.
100:37:04|T|CDR|Okay, going through. After the "Shutdown on burn time minus 1 second, we scratch the next line; and we scratch ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to PULSE"; we scratch Damp excessive rates via LM Y, Z translation; we add the line Null error needles, trim - Null the error needles and trim address 470 to - What was the value there, Charlie?
100:37:30|C|Duke|0.1 foot per second. The reason we are shutting down on the burn time is, since the ASA breaker has been out for so long, we're not real confident that our AGS PIPAs are going to be super-sharp. So we want to make sure that we just get a burn time - no overburn; so we're, shutting down on burn time minus 1 second. And then that will allow us a plus-X translation to trim 470 if it looks okay. If we had an overburn, we'd be in  -
100:38:09|T|CDR|Okay.
100:38:10|C|Duke|-  if we had an overburn, we'd be impinging on our command module to try to trim it out, so that's our reasoning there. Over.
100:38:20|T|CDR|Okay. Understand.
100:38:21|C|Duke|Okay. Picking up in the middle of the page, that - a block CMS resume attitude control, scratch. Scratch the next line; PRO VERB 96. Scratch the third line; PROPELLANT QUANTITY MONITOR, OFF. Over.
100:38:43|T|CDR|Okay. We'll scratch the block, and we'll scratch the PRO VERB 96; then we'll scratch PROPELLANT QUANTITY MONITOR, OFF.
100:38:51|C|Duke|Rog. Now, at the bottom of that page, I have a procedure for you to reestablish PTC. Over.
100:39:30|T|CDR|To reestablish PTC. Go ahead.
100:39:33|C|Duke|Okay. First line, ATTITUDE CONTROL, three to PULSE; line 2, Roll with the TTCA until attitude is roll, plus or minus 90; pitch, 0; yaw, 0. Over.
100:40:39|T|CDR|Okay. Step 1, ATTITUDE CONTROL, three to PULSE; 2, Roll with the TTCA until the attitude is plus or minus 90 degrees, pitch is 0 and yaw is 0, and I think that will be on the AGS ball.
100:40:56|C|Duke|That's affirmative. You broke up there for a minute, Jim. We'll do that on the AGS ball from the burn attitude. We just want you to roll either way 90 degrees, keep pitch 0 and yaw 0. Now, step 3; "When at - when at attitude, ACA out of detent." Step 4; "ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to MODE CONTROL. When rates are less than 0.05, ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to PULSE.
100:41:52|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. Can you hold up here a second? I lost you.
100:41:55|C|Duke|Roger.
100:42:00|T|CDR|Start with step 3 again. When attitude - When at attitude, ACA out of detent.
100:42:09|C|Duke|That's Rog. Next step, step 4: ATTITUDE CONTROL to YAW - Correction, ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to MODE CONTROL. Over.
100:42:33|T|CDR|Okay. Step 4 is ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to MODE CONTROL.
100:42:37|C|Duke|Roger. Step 5: When rates are less than 0.05 degrees per second, ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to PULSE.
100:43:08|T|CDR|Okay. When rates are less than 0.05 degrees per second, ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to PULSE.
100:43:16|C|Duke|Roger. Step 6: Spin up to 0.3 degree per second in yaw," and that takes about 21 pulses. Step 7 - Yes.
100:43:49|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.
100:43:51|C|Duke|Okay. Step 7: MODE CONTROL, AGS, OFF.
100:44:09|T|CDR|Okay. Step 6 was Spin up to 0.3 degrees per second in yaw; that's about 21 pulses. Step 7 was MODE CONTROL, AGS, to OFF.
100:44:19|C|Duke|That's affirm. Step 8: Power down per power - Correction, Power down per contingency checklist page Power 5. Over.
100:44:46|T|CDR|Okay. And step 8 is Power down per contingency checklist Power 5, and I take it that's been revamped considering our situation. Okay.
100:44:56|C|Duke|That's affirmative, Jim. That's the one we gave you last night after the big burn, and we'll use that one as modified by - by us. This - we tried this PTC under AGS in the simulator and, of course, no slosh or anything, but it seemed to work pretty good by nulling the rates using the TTCA in pitch and roll and letting the AGS do it in yaw. You null the rates by looking at the error needles and just watching those, and when they don't - when they stop moving, then you got it within the limits of what we want. Over.
100:45:40|T|CDR|Okay. And I guess, Charlie, you have no - Do you have a ATT hold mode in pitch and roll at all in this configuration we're in, or do we have to use the TTCAs?
100:45:52|C|Duke|We feel like we have to use the TTCA. The AGS gains are not too good in pitch and roll in this configuration. It'll hold it in yaw but it won't in pitch and roll. Over.
100:46:07|T|CDR|Okay.
100:46:09|C|Duke|And you'll have - During the burn, of course, you'll be controlling pitch and roll via the error needles with the TTCA also, and it's the little scheme that we've practiced in some of the SIMs. Over.
100:46:28|T|CDR|Right. Understand.
100:46:37|T|CDR|And, Houston, want to make sure that we allow enough time to get to the proper attitude for the burn so that we can be sure we establish the proper attitude and don't have to rush the burn.
100:46:51|C|Duke|Roger, Jim. We  - we're looking right now, tentatively, at starting this about 45 minutes before the burn and our sensitivity is - not too bad on this burn. We can go 30 minutes either way and not affect our DELTA-V. Over.
100:47:11|T|CDR|Okay. Fine. And do you have a handle on just how long the burn will be? In time?
100:47:17|C|Duke|It's looking like at about 7.8 seconds and about 15 - Correction, 7.8 feet per second and about 15 seconds. Over.
100:47:30|T|CDR|In about 18 seconds?
100:47:32|C|Duke|Negative. 15. One fiver.
100:47:37|T|CDR|One fiver. Okay.
100:47:39|C|Duke|And one other point is that we'd like to remind you that this is going to be in blowdown and both REGs B closed but we've got plenty at the 10 percent.
100:47:54|T|CDR|Understand.
100:47:57|C|Duke|And, Jim, in the simulator with our configuration that we, had here, the thing is real stable at 10 percent, so we don't think you'll have to tweak very much at all using the TTCAs. Over.
100:48:11|T|CDR|Okay. Understand.
100:48:14|C|Duke|And I'll give you back to Vance. Thank you.
100:48:20|T|CDR|And thank you.
100:50:08|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
100:50:13|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
100:50:15|C|Brand|Jim, regarding your number 2 battery, we think that it's probably a sensor failure, a temperature sensor failure that's caused this alarm, rather than an actual overtemp of the battery; the reason being that we haven't seen any higher temperatures in the glycol loop. We expect to put the battery back on about 101 hours. That'll be about 10 minutes, and then we'll look at it some more there. Over
100:50:49|T|CDR|Okay. Concerning number 2 battery, you think it might be a sensor failure because you haven't seen any changes, and you're going to put the battery back on the line in about 10 minutes.
100:50:58|C|Brand|That's affirm.
100:51:02|T|CDR|Okay.
100:58:47|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
100:58:51|C|Brand|Go ahead, Jim.
100:58:55|T|CDR|For information, Vance, about a half hour ago, I guess, Jack and I could see constellations at certain spacecraft attitudes, stars. We could see the - Scorpio and Sagittarius and we could see Altair or Acrux and Alpha Centuri, Vega, stars of that magnitude, and our venting has stopped which allows us now to differentiate between the particles and the stars.
100:59:28|C|Brand|Roger; copy. Understand you can see the stars pretty well. Were you, at that time, in an attitude facing away from the Sun? I presume this is very attitude critical.
100:59:44|T|CDR|Yes. It is somewhat, Vance. If we have the Sun shining off the quads, it sort of ruins our vision; and also, if the Earth or the Moon are in the general field of view, we can't see anything.
100:59:58|C|Brand|Okay. Thank you.
101:01:40|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
101:01:46|T|CDR|Go ahead, Vance.
101:01:48|C|Brand|Jim, we're ready to put that battery back on the line. Request you open the CROSS TIE BAL LOAD circuit breaker, panel 16, and then put back - BAT 2 back on the line.
101:02:05|T|CDR|Okay. First of all, we'll open the BALANCE CROSS TIE breaker on panel 16.
101:02:12|C|Brand|That's affirm.
101:02:27|T|CDR|Okay. The CROSS TIE BALANCE LOAD circuit breakers is in now, Vance. Now you want us to put battery 2 back on. Is that affirm?
101:02:34|C|Brand|Did you say it was in, or did you pull it out?
101:02:39|T|CDR|No. It's in; do you want it out?
101:02:42|C|Brand|That's affirm. We'd like it out, and then BAT 2 on the line.
101:02:47|T|CDR|Okay. Coming out. BAT 2 is on the line. We have a MASTER ALARM and a BATTERY light.
101:03:02|C|Brand|Copy. And - and we think that's probably an indication of the sensor problem, but stand by.
101:05:02|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
101:05:07|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
101:05:09|C|Brand|Jim, it looks to us like your battery is good, that this is in fact a sensor problem; therefore, request you close the CROSS TIE BAL LOADs on - circuit breaker on panel 16. Advise  -
101:05:25|T|CDR|Okay.
101:05:27|C|Brand|-  advise that you will not have any malfunction indication on any of your batteries now, but we can watch it from the ground. Over.
101:05:39|T|CDR|Okay. We'll close the CROSS TIE BALANCE LOAD circuit breaker at this time.
101:05:47|C|Brand|Roger. Copy.
101:05:49|T|CDR|That's closed, and we don't have any warning on any of the batteries, but you can monitor from the ground.
101:05:53|C|Brand|That's affirm.
101:05:53|C|Brand|That's affirm.
101:06:03|C|Brand|And, Jim, we have a lengthy procedure here for powering up the CSM and turning on instrumentation so we can check the TM, and this will take a large piece of scratch paper whenever you're ready to copy.
101:06:22|T|CDR|This is to power up the CSM?
101:06:24|C|Brand|That's affirm.
101:06:27|T|CDR|Okay. I'll tell you what, I'll have Jack get configured. He can copy that down and I'll have him - we'll get the stuff. Stand by.
101:06:33|C|Brand|Okay.
101:07:35|T|CMP|Okay, Vance, how do you read the Aquarius?
101:07:39|C|Brand|Okay, read you loud and clear, Aquarius. Is it cool in there now?
101:07:44|T|CMP|Okay. Yes, it's pretty cool. This is the third officer on this LM crew here. Ready to copy.
101:07:55|C|Brand|Okay. Jack, this is a lengthy procedure, take probably two or three pages. It assumes that you are in your nominal configuration, which was sent up - or in your baseline configuration, which was sent up to you earlier today.
101:08:15|T|CMP|Okay. I can verify that we are in that configuration with the exception of panel 382, the water accumulator, which I've left off in case we wanted to get some more drinking water out of the command module, and I'll put those in the proper configuration before we do anything.
101:08:38|C|Brand|Okay. Ready to copy?
101:08:43|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
101:08:45|C|Brand|Okay. Panel 4: TELCOMM, GROUP 1, to AC1. Panel 5: close the following circuit breakers:  ECS, PRESS GROUP 1, MAIN B; ECS, PRESS GROUP 2, MAIN B; ECS, TEMP, MAIN B; ECS, SECONDARY LOOP TRANSDUCER, MAIN B; ECS RAD, CONTROL/HEATERS, MAIN B; BAT RELAY BUS, BAT B; BAT CHARGER, BAT B, CHARGE - or to B, CHARGE; INVERTER CONTROL, 2; INVERTER CONTROL, 1; EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC1; EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B; EPS SENSOR UNIT, AC BUS 1; WASTE/POTABLE WATER, MAIN B; INSTRUMENTS, ESS, MAIN B; that's ESSENTIAL, MAIN B. Are you with me?
101:11:32|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. Are you with me?
101:11:34|C|Brand|Roger. Why don't you read that group back, and then we'll proceed on.
101:11:39|T|CMP|Okay, sounds good. Because I don't know where I - how far I lost you. Okay, panel 4; TELCOMM, GROUP 1, to AC1. On panel 5, close the following circuit breakers: ECS, PRESSURE GROUP 1, MAIN B; ECS, PRESSURE GROUP 2, MAIN B; ECS, TEMP, MAIN B; ECS, SECONDARY LOOP TPANSDUCER, MAIN B; ECS RAD, CONTROL/HEATERS, MAIN B; BAT RELAY BUS, BAT B; BAT CHARGER, BAT B; INVERTER CONTROL, 2; INVERTER CONTROL, 1; EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC1; EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B; EPS SENSOR UNIT, AC1; WASTE/POTABLE H2O, MAIN B; INSTRUMENTATION, ESSENTIAL, MAIN B.
101:12:41|C|Brand|Okay; That's all correct. Is that reading rate okay for you?
101:12:48|T|CMP|Yes, that's fine.
101:12:50|C|Brand|Okay, and leave a little space if you can to the right of these because when we talk about the backup procedure, why then we can just use the same listing, and I'll - I'll tell you open instead of close these circuit breakers, or at least most of them. Over.
101:13:12|T|CMP|Okay.
101:13:14|C|Brand|Okay. Next, panel 3: TRANSPONDER, PRIMARY; POWER AMPL, to PRIMARY, that's a verify; POWER AMPL, HIGH; MODE, VOICE, to OFF; POWER, SCE, to NORMAL; PMP to NORMAL; S-BAND ANTENNA, OMNI D, that's Delta. Okay, why don't you read that one back?
101:14:16|T|CMP|Okay. On panel 3: TRANSPONDER to PRIMARY; POWER AMPLIFIER to PRIMARY; POWER AMPL, HIGH; MODE, VOICE, to OFF; POWER, SCE, to NORMAL; PMP to NORMAL; S-BAND ANTENNA, OMNI D, D as in Doggy.
101:14:37|C|Brand|Hey, very good. Okay, panel 225: circuit breaker FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, to close; circuit breaker CTE, MAIN B, to close. Panel 250: CB BAT C BAT CHARGER/EDS 2 to close.
101:15:18|T|CMP|Hey, Vance, just a minute. Slow down, would you?
101:15:21|C|Brand|Okay.
101:15:24|T|CMP|Okay. I got distracted here. On panel 225: CB FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, close; and then I lost you after that.
101:15:37|C|Brand|Okay. After that, CB CTE, MAIN B, to close. Next, panel 250: CB BAT C BAT CHARGE/EDS2 to close; CB BAT C POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING to close. Next, panel 275: CB MAIN B, BAT BUS B, to close; CB INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, to close. Okay. Incidentally, anything that I've given you up until now is not sequence critical, but from now on, it should be - you should be sure to do it in the sequence we give you. Why don't you read that back, Jack?
101:17:39|T|CMP|Okay. Let me give you all of panel 225 again. CB FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, close; CB CTE, MAIN B, close. On panel 250: CB BAT - B BAT CHARGE, that should be BAT C, Charlie, isn't it? BAT CHARGE/EDS2 closed?
101:18:01|C|Brand|That's right. That's  -
101:18:02|T|CMP|CB BAT B POWER ENTRY  -
101:18:06|C|Brand|Okay. That should be BAT Charlie.
101:18:08|T|CMP|Let me finish. Okay. That's what I thought. BAT Charlie BAT CHARGE/EDS2, close; BAT Baker POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, closed. On panel 275: CB MAIN B, BAT BUS B, closed; CB INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, closed.
101:18:32|C|Brand|Okay. That's correct except for the second circuit breaker on panel 250, which is CB BAT Charlie POWER ENTRY slash POSTLANDING, close.
101:18:50|T|CMP|Okay. BAT Charlie POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING.
101:18:57|C|Brand|Okay, now back to panel 250. CB BAT Bravo POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, close. Next, MDC 3, AC INVERTER 2 to MAIN B. AC INVERTER 2, AC BUS 1, on up. Next, panel 5: AC INVERTER AC BUS 1 to RESET and then center. Panel 3: UP TLM to COMMAND RESET then OFF. Then select best OMNI. Readback, please.
101:20:48|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. The following steps are sequence critical. Panel 250: CB BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, closed. That's BAT Baker. MDC 3, AC INVERTER 2, to MAIN B; AC INVERTER 2, AC1, on. And then there was - standby.
101:21:27|C|Brand|How do you read now, Jack?
101:21:31|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. Did you - how far did you - did you copy any of my steps there?
101:21:37|C|Brand|Okay, I heard you through AC INVERTER 2, AC BUS 1 to on, and you were cut out by noise. Go ahead.
101:21:48|T|CMP|Okay, Now comes to one I didn't understand. You said go over to MDC 5 and A in - AC INVERTER, AC BUS 1, RESET, then center, and then back to MDC 3; UP TELEMETRY, COMMAND RESET then OFF, and then select best OMNI.
101:22:10|C|Brand|Roger. The readback's correct, but let me recheck that. Stand by.
101:22:31|C|Brand|Jack, we were incorrect on panel 5; that should have been panel 3.
101:22:39|T|CMP|Okay, that's good. I got it.
101:22:44|C|Brand|Okay. Now, when you're in this configuration, the following onboard readouts are required. Panel 3: BAT C voltage, PYRO BAT A voltage, PYRO BAT B voltage, SPS HELIUM PRESSURE. And the following readouts on panel 101: CM RCS injector temperatures, those are positions 5 Charlie, 5 Delta, 6 Alfa, 6 Bravo, 6 Charlie, 6 Delta; and the battery manifold pressure, which is 4 Alfa. And standing by for readback.
101:24:40|T|CMP|Okay. You want me to read out on MDC 3: BAT B voltage, PYRO A voltage, PYRO B voltage, SPS HELIUM PRESSURE. On panel 101: command module RCS injector temperatures; 5 Charlie, 5 Dog, 6 Alfa, 6 Baker, 6 Charlie, 6 Dog. The battery manifold pressure, 4 Alfa.
101:25:09|C|Brand|Okay. Now - that was correct but I want to recheck the very first one, that was BAT Charlie voltage. Is that what you read back?
101:25:18|T|CMP|Okay. Okay, BAT Charlie voltage. Seems like we're having a difference - I can't understand BAT Charlie from BAT Dog.
101:25:30|C|Brand|Okay. Now, that - that complete procedure for getting into it, as far as getting into it's concerned. What I will give you now is how to back out of it after you're through with your readings. Are you ready to copy?
101:25:52|T|CMP|Okay.
101:25:55|C|Brand|Okay. Now you'll back out fairly quickly after you go into this procedure. All we'll need is about 5 minutes of TM, and so if you're ready to copy, here it comes.
101:26:11|T|CMP|Go ahead.
101:26:13|C|Brand|Panel 3: POWER AMPL to OFF. Incidentally, copy this down on a piece of scratch paper as I read it, and then later I'll refer back to your first list where you can write things in the righthand margin.
101:26:38|T|CMP|Okay.
101:26:41|C|Brand|Okay  -
101:26:42|T|CMP|Go ahead. You want - Repeat the one on panel 3 again, Vance.
101:26:48|C|Brand|Okay. POWER AMPL, OFF.
101:26:59|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
101:27:01|C|Brand|TRANSPONDER, OFF. AC INVERTER, 2, to OFF. Okay. Next, panel 250: CB BAT Bravo, POWER ENTRY/ POSTLANDING to open. Stand by 1.
101:28:22|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. What I just gave you now on the backout is the only thing that's order critical. From here on, you can go to the steps for initiating the procedure, and backtrack. In other words, you should go to each of the panels that I read up and put the circuit breakers back to the base-line configuration - or the switches. Over.
101:28:56|T|CMP|Okay, now here's - to exit, here's the sequence-critical steps: POWER AMPL, OFF; TRANSPONDER OFF; AC INVERTER, 2, OFF; and the last one on panel 250, CB BAT Baker POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, open; and then hit the steps in reverse order that you gave them to me, and back out, like then I would start on MDC 3 UP TELEMETRY, OFF - to OFF; and then AC INVERTER - AC1 BUS 1 to OFF; and then AC INVERTER, 2, OFF; AC INVERTER, 2, MAIN B to OFF. Is that the type of order that you want to back out of?
101:29:59|C|Brand|That's affirm, but - just for kicks, let's go through these panels again, and I'll give you the - the position, just to make sure there can be no doubt.
101:30:18|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
101:30:20|C|Brand|Okay. And once again in the - in the area where I said order was not critical, it's still not critical when you back out. But now I'll go ahead. Okay, panel 4: TELCOMM, GROUP 1, AC1, it will not be AC1, it'll go to OFF. Panel 5: all circuit breakers on that panel which were positioned will now come to opened. Over.
101:31:01|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 4: TELCOMM, GROUP 1 will go OFF. Panel 5: all the circuit breakers that we closed will go back to open.
101:31:12|C|Brand|Okay. Panel 3: the first three lines have been taken care of already in my beginning in the backout procedure, so starting with MODE, VOICE, that should go back to VOICE. POWER, SCE, OFF; PMP, OFF; S-BAND ANTENNA, OMNI Bravo. Panel 225: CB FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, open; CB CTE, MAIN B, open. Read back.
101:32:19|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. I'm going to have to switch OMNIs. I'm starting to get some static here.
101:32:23|C|Brand|Okay.
101:32:34|T|CMP|Okay. How do you read on AFT OMNI?
101:32:37|C|Brand|Loud and clear.
101:32:44|T|CMP|Okay. On panel 3: the first three steps we took care of; MODE, VOICE, to VOICE; POWER, SCE, OFF; POWER PMP to OFF; and S-BAND OMNI would go back to Bravo. Panel 225: FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, will go open; and CB CTE, MAIN B, will go open.
101:33:11|C|Brand|That's affirm. The two circuit breakers on panel 250 will go open; the two circuit breakers, panel 275, will go open. Okay, the circuit breakers on panel 250, we took care of already. Panel 3: AC INVERTER, 2, we took care of. AC INVERTER 2, AC BUS 1 should now go OFF. And the remaining two switches on panel 3 we took care of. And "Select best OMNI" remains the same. Okay. Read back.
101:34:25|T|CMP|Okay. The two switches - two circuit breakers on panel 250 will go back to open; the two circuit breakers on panel 275 back to open; the POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING circuit breaker, we already took care of earlier; AC INVERTER 2; we took care of earlier; AC INVERTER 2 to AC BUS 1 will go to OFF; and AC INVERTER, AC BUS 1, we took care of - No, that'll go to OFF; and UP TELEMETRY, COMMAND RESET will go OFF.
101:35:14|C|Brand|That's correct, Jack. Okay, that's it. And I think we're about ready to go with this procedure whenever you are.
101:35:28|T|CMP|Okay. First we got to go through that procedure to power the CSM from the LM, is that Charlie?
101:35:35|C|Brand|No. No, this is independent of power from the LM. This is a - this is purely a CSM  -
101:35:42|T|CMP|Oh, okay.
101:35:43|C|Brand|This is purely a CSM powerup so we can take a look at your telemetry and see how cold the vehicle is and that sort of thing.
101:35:55|T|CMP|Okay. It's going in work.
101:36:03|T|CMP|Okay, now I won't - I won't have any voice with you, so - Is that right? You don't want me to get connected up - you want me to just take these readings and come back and tell you what I have, huh?
101:36:17|C|Brand|That's affirm. There'll be no voice. And  -
101:36:22|T|CMP|Okay. Okay. In work.
101:36:28|C|Brand|I - we presume, though, that there'll be somebody in the LM that we can call if we have to get word to you.
101:36:35|T|CMP|Oh, yes. There'll be somebody to be standing by, they'll run up into the bedroom and tell me to stop what I'm doing.
101:36:44|C|Brand|Okay, and let us know when you start.
101:36:51|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going to start right now, Vance.
101:36:54|C|Brand|Okay.
101:37:12|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
101:37:30|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
101:37:36|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. Switching watches, and Jack's going up into the command module.
101:37:43|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. We have four steps here to give you to request that you get back on DOWN VOICE BACKUP, if you're ready to copy?
101:38:03|T|CDR|Ready to copy.
101:38:04|C|Brand|Okay. Bit rate to LO bit rate. VOICE, FUNCTION switch to DOWN VOICE BACKUP. POWER AMPs CB, open; RANGE FUNCTION switch in RANGING; that's verify.
101:38:47|T|CDR|Okay. Bit rate, LO; VOICE FUNCTION, DOWN VOICE BACKUP; POWER AMP S-BAND, open; and RANGE FUNCTION to RANGE; and that's a verify. And I still have the BIOMED on RIGHT here, so we don't have hot mike.
101:39:08|C|Brand|Okay. Thank you.
101:39:12|T|CDR|And, you want that in work, now?
101:39:14|C|Brand|That's affirm,
101:39:17|T|CDR|Okay.
101:39:50|T|CDR|Okay. Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?
101:39:53|C|Brand|Loud and clear, Jim.
101:39:57|T|CDR|Okay. I have a question for you, Houston, if you have time,
101:40:00|C|Brand|Sure, go ahead.
101:40:05|T|CDR|And I'm copying down the reestablishing - PTC maneuver that Charlie gave me. Step 5 was, "When rates are less than 0.05 degrees per second, ATTITUDE CONTROL YAW to PULSE." And just how am I to get my rates down to 0.05 degrees per second. My - My rate indicator, at the best, is 0.1 of a degree.
101:40:37|C|Brand|Stand by.
101:41:38|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
101:41:43|T|CDR|Go ahead.
101:41:44|C|Brand|Jim, this has been tried in the simulator by Charlie and others, and what they recommend is that you null your rates on the error needles until you see no movement whatsoever, and then wait another couple of minutes, and that should do it. That's the only way we can tell. Over.
101:42:09|T|CDR|Okay. I'll give it the old college try.
101:42:12|C|Brand|Okay. And if you can't attain that, why, of course, just the best you can do. We'll have to give it a try. Maybe it won't be quite like the simulator.
101:42:24|T|CDR|Right.
101:48:43|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
101:48:47|C|Brand|Go ahead, Aquarius.
101:48:50|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. I've gone all the way through your procedure - all the way down to "Select best OMNIs," but I'm not getting any MAIN BUS B voltage and this I don't understand.
101:49:03|C|Brand|Roger.
101:49:04|T|CMP|I can read BAT - BAT BUS. I can read BAT BUS B voltage at 36.5 ... 37.0
101:49:43|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. Do you read now?
101:49:48|T|CMP|I am not sure, Vance.
101:49:51|C|Brand|Okay. You faded out due to noise in the orientation. If you close the POWER AMP circuit breaker, we can hear you better. Over.
101:50:07|C|Brand|That's panel 16.
101:50:11|T|CMP|Okay.
101:50:13|C|Brand|Okay. You faded out at the very beginning, so please go through that again. We understand you don't get anything on MAIN B.
101:50:39|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. How are you reading now?
101:50:43|C|Brand|Okay. We're hearing you better. Stand by 1.
101:52:24|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. Please, repeat back now your conversation. You were cut out for - a while ago.
101:52:36|T|CMP|I don't have any idea where we cut out, Vance. I just said that we performed the procedure exactly as you say. We're down into the step critical portion to where I said, "select best OMNI." However, we're not getting any MAIN BUS B voltage reading. I can read BAT BUS B, Baker, at 36.5; BAT Charlie at 37.0, but I have negative MAIN BUS B readings.
101:53:08|C|Brand|Okay. Stand by.
101:53:24|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. There are two - There's a switch and a circuit breaker that were positioned this morning that we'd like to have you check - Correction, just the switch. Panel 5, check your bus tie. MAIN BUS TIE BAT B/C on.
101:53:47|T|CMP|That is verified on. I checked that.
101:53:50|C|Brand|Okay.
101:55:22|C|Brand|Okay, Jack; this is Houston. Over.
101:55:29|T|CMP|Go ahead, Vance.
101:55:31|C|Brand|Okay. We're getting data from you, Jack, so that much looks good. On panel 5, request verification that EPS SENSOR SIGNAL circuit breaker is MAIN B. Over.
101:55:47|T|CMP|Okay.
101:55:48|C|Brand|Or it's  -
101:55:49|T|CMP|-  Stand by.  -
101:55:50|C|Brand|-  that MAIN B is closed.
101:55:53|T|CMP|Okay.
101:56:10|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. And, we see your MAIN BUS B voltage at 28-1/2.
101:56:17|T|CMP|Okay. You can see it. Good. Okay then. Okay, Vance. That circuit breaker is in.
101:56:28|C|Brand|Copy.
101:56:42|T|CMP|Well, Vance, if you're getting data from them, let me go back up there and finish these ...
101:56:52|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. Please repeat, you're cutting out.
101:56:54|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. Okay. We just changed OMNIs here. I say, if you're getting data from us, that's the important thing. Let me go back up into the bedroom there and get the readings you wanted, so we can get this stuff powered down. Is that okay?
101:57:10|T|CMP|Okay, we'll get  -
101:57:11|C|Brand|-  by all means and  -
101:57:12|T|CMP|-  down there  -
101:57:13|C|Brand|-  select best OMNI  -
101:57:14|T|CMP|-  and then go back up.
101:57:22|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. We'll go back up - We've got voltage now, and we'll go back up and take the readings that you want.
101:57:34|C|Brand|Okay. And select best OMNI.
101:57:44|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going back up into the bedroom, Vance. How do you read?
101:57:47|C|Brand|Loud and clear.
101:57:51|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going back up to the bedroom. We'll select best OMNI and continue on with the procedure.
101:57:58|C|Brand|Roger.
101:58:47|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. Jim's up. How do you read?
101:58:50|C|Brand|Reading you loud and clear, Jim.
101:58:54|T|CDR|Okay.
101:59:07|T|CDR|And, Houston, I noticed through the AOT and through the overhead docking window that we are venting again.
101:59:16|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. Understand; the service module is venting.
101:59:22|T|CDR|That's affirm.
102:01:17|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
102:01:22|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
102:01:24|C|Brand|Jim, would you holler into the bedroom and tell Jack that when he has his onboard readouts that we wish he'd back - use the backout procedure and shut down again - per the procedure we gave him.
102:01:39|T|CDR|Roger. As soon as he - As soon as he gets his onboard readouts to use the powerdown procedure and shut down. Is that right?
102:01:47|C|Brand|That's affirm.
102:01:49|T|CDR|Okay. Jack just - Jack just told me that he's through, and he's going to go through the backout procedures again, the first one he's got is the shutdown.
102:01:54|C|Brand|Okay.
102:06:52|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 102 hours 6 minutes. We've got 7 minutes 37 seconds worth of telemetry data on the command service module during this power up of the command module. We powered up just enough to enable us to get telemetry signals and for the flight controllers to take a quick telemetry snapshot of the command module. They appear to like what they've seen. G and C reports propulsions systems, pressure and temperature all look good on the CSM. Apollo 13 is 160,331 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 4,295 feet per second.
102:08:19|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
102:08:24|C|Brand|Go ahead, Aquarius.
102:08:28|T|CDR|Jack's ready to give you the readings if you are ready to copy them.
102:08:31|C|Brand|Stand by.
102:08:40|C|Brand|Okay. Go ahead.
102:08:51|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. The readings that you wanted; are you ready?
102:08:57|C|Brand|Ready to copy, Jack.
102:09:01|T|CMP|BAT Charlie, 37.0; pyro A, 37.0; pyro B, 37.0; SPS helium pressure, 3450; and just for kicks, nitrogen A, 2300; nitrogen B, 2400; CM RCS injector temperatures: 5 Charlie, 4.5; 5 Dog, 3.5; 6 Alfa, 4.0; 6 Baker, 4.6; 6 Charlie, 4.0; 6 Dog, 3.8; battery manifold pressure, 4 Alfa, 1.4.
102:10:11|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. We got it. Thank you very much.
102:10:17|T|CMP|Okay. How does the telemetry look on our - on the old Odyssey?
102:10:21|C|Brand|It doesn't look too cold. Looks pretty good.
102:10:27|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you very much.
102:10:30|C|Brand|You bet.
102:10:31|T|CMP|We're going to need him.
102:10:37|C|Slayton|How does it feel, Jack?
102:10:42|T|CMP|I'll tell you, Deke, it's cold up in there. I don't know whether we'll be able to sleep up there tonight; it must be about 35 or 40 degrees.
102:10:52|C|Slayton|Roger. That's just what I was worrying about.
102:10:59|T|CMP|Right now, we're getting two sets of CWGs on.
102:11:12|T|CMP|It's not uncomfortable at all in Aquarius, but it definitely is cold in Odyssey.
102:11:18|C|Slayton|Roger.
102:11:45|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. Jim's back on.
102:11:50|C|Brand|Go ahead, Jim.
102:11:54|T|CDR|We just had a change in watch; that's all.
102:11:57|C|Brand|Okay.
102:14:38|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston, Over.
102:14:44|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
102:14:46|C|Brand|Jim, two items: in the command module, we wish to verify that the PYRO BATTERY selector was left in the main position. And we're ready to have the POWER AMP circuit breaker on panel 16 pulled, whenever you are ready.
102:15:43|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. Fred just tells me that he put it there, and we're checking that again about the PYRO BATTERY selector in the main position.
102:15:54|C|Brand|Okay. Understand that you are checking it.
102:15:59|T|CDR|And I will pull the POWER AMP circuit breaker.
102:16:01|C|Brand|Roger.
102:25:49|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
102:25:54|C|Brand|Go ahead, Jim.
102:25:57|T|CDR|How does number 2 battery look to you now?
102:26:07|C|Brand|Stand by.
102:26:48|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
102:26:53|T|CDR|Go ahead.
102:26:55|C|Brand|Jim, it looks like it was probably a sensor problem; the battery number 2 is load-sharing well. And we see no indications of higher temperatures in the glycol loop or anything that would make us think that it is heating up.
102:27:14|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
102:27:16|C|Brand|Roger.
102:51:18|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
102:51:24|C|Brand|Roger. Go ahead.
102:51:30|T|CDR|I just want to talk over a little philosophy here. Fred told me that at one time you came up and told him that we were a little steep on the entry angle, and now our burn is going to make us - give us a steeper angle. I just want to make sure that we're all talking about the same thing, that, in essence, at this particular situation, we're shallow, not steep, and we are going to increase the angle.
102:52:08|C|Brand|Jim, the situation is that, at the moment, we're a little bit shallow, and retrograde midcourse is going to put us more in the center of the corridor. Over.
102:52:27|T|CDR|Okay; Fine. I just, wanted to make sure. Fred had written down, some time ago, that - that our angle now was about 71 and we were going to do a midcourse of 7 feet per second because it appears that we're going to shallow it out. I think we're all talking the same language now.
102:52:47|C|Brand|Roger. And, I guess it follows, but your perigee is a little bit high right now, too; so that will be bringing it back - back down, that is.
102:52:57|T|CDR|Yes. Yes, that's the important thing.
102:53:16|C|Brand|One other question, Jim. Our readings down here say your LM cabin's about as cold as the command module cabin. Is that right?
102:53:29|T|CDR|Well, we really don't know. There's usually two people in the LM cabin, and it's a lot - It seems to be a lot more compact, and so we don't notice the coldness down here as we do in the command module.
102:53:41|C|Brand|Okay.
102:56:32|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
102:56:35|C|Brand|Go ahead.
102:56:40|T|CDR|Some time ago, I copied down a long COMM midcourse-7 corridor control burn at a GET of 134:59:42.98. Is that burn PAD still valid?
102:57:07|C|Brand|Jim, that's affirm. That PAD is still valid.
102:57:14|T|CDR|And that is assuming no midcourse 7 here at 105 hours.
102:57:19|C|Brand|That's affirm.
102:57:58|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
102:58:03|T|CDR|Go ahead.
102:58:04|C|Brand|Jim, we're setting up your burn for 105:30, and we'll be working up a PAD, et cetera, based on that time. Over.
102:58:17|T|CDR|Roger. The time will 105:30.
102:58:21|C|Brand|And, additional point; I guess this one's for Jack. Do we have any idea why we couldn't read the MAIN BUS B voltage a while back when first he didn't get it and then later he did?
102:58:40|T|CDR|Yes. I think we have a reason for that. Stand by.
102:59:04|T|CDR|It appears, Vance, that the battery charge circuit breaker which appeared to be in, wasn't in. Fred pulled it and reset it, and then he started getting readings.
102:59:17|C|Brand|Roger. Which circuit breaker was that?
102:59:28|T|CDR|It was - It was the battery charge circuit breaker that allows you to read volts, but we haven't - don't know the exact name for it yet.
102:59:39|C|Brand|Okay. Understand.
102:59:48|T|CDR|The name is BATTERY CHARGER BAT B CHARGE. Jack tells me.
102:59:52|C|Brand|Okay. BATTERY CHARGER BAT B CHARGE.
103:00:22|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
103:00:25|T|CDR|Go ahead.
103:00:28|C|Brand|Have you opened your - just curiosity - Have you opened your food locker just aft of the LM data file? Over.
103:00:51|T|CDR|Yes. It's been opened.
103:00:55|C|Brand|Okay. Just checking. Thanks.
103:00:57|T|CDR|... meal had come through.
103:01:00|C|Brand|Good.
103:01:14|T|CDR|It came at the right time.
103:01:18|C|Brand|Good.
103:03:30|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
103:03:36|T|CDR|Go ahead.
103:03:38|C|Brand|Jim, we have some CSM temperatures here for you that might be of interest, if you're ready to copy.
103:03:56|T|CDR|Roger. Go ahead.
103:03:58|C|Brand|Okay. Your quad package temperatures range from 85 degrees to 44 degrees. Your CM RCS injectors range from 44 degrees to 21; and your heat shield is well above its lower limits in all the various locations. Temperatures appear to be cycling based on Sun angle, and it's no sweat. They all look very good.
103:04:45|T|CDR|Sounds good.
103:27:08|T|CDR|Were you calling, Houston?
103:27:12|C|Brand|Negative, Jim.
103:27:16|T|CDR|Okay.
103:42:51|T|LMP|And, Houston, how do you read Aquarius?
103:42:54|C|Brand|Read you loud and clear, Fred. How do you read?
103:42:59|T|LMP|Okay, same-o.
103:43:01|C|Brand|Roger. We were just about to send you up some items of information pertaining to the burn. Are you ready to copy?
103:43:13|T|LMP|Stand by.
103:43:15|C|Brand|Okay.
103:43:40|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead, Vance.
103:43:43|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. First of all, preparations for this, starting with contingency checklist, page 24, we would recommend should start at 104:30 GET, and we'll be happy to receive any comments you have on that, though. Second point: when you're in the burn attitude, you should see the Sun at the very top of the AOT. It'll be splitting the cursor, when your cursor's set at zero. One thing to be aware of though, that it'll slip right out of the AOT very easily since it'll be very sensitive to roll and yaw. And that's in detent 2, by the way. Next point: the burn is very insensitive to burn time and attitude. In other words, if necessary, we can slip it if there's any problem at all, and attitude isn't too critical. So that brings us to the point that we only have one real burn rule; that is, if - rate about any axis gets to 10 degrees a second, that's the limit to stop the burn. Next point, after you finish the burn, and before you trim, request that you leave DEDA in address 470 up a while so we can take a look at it, and let us holler when we've seen it, and then proceed on. Over.
103:45:54|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. You're saying we should start into the prep in the contingency book at about 104:30, and I'll talk this over in a minute with Jim and we'll get back with you on it. When in the burn attitude, we should see the Sun right at the top of the AOT, and I assume this is detent number 2. Jim and I'd already been talking about that, and just eyeballing the terminator in the Earth, we figured the Sun at about something like a 70-degree angle - 65-degree angle, so that'll be right up there. We get one burn rule that says if the rates are greater than 10 degrees per second, shut her down. And, after we trim, you want me to leave 470 up for a while so you all can have a look at it, and you'll tell me when to get rid of it.
103:46:52|C|Brand|That's right, Fred. And, if you have any questions at all regarding the alignment, why please let us know. We'll be happy to answer them, like aligning on the Earth, as was described before. Also, you should know that the pitch is the most critical attitude so far as errors are concerned in this burn; but, as I said, it's still not very sensitive.
103:47:30|T|LMP|Yes, the - and unfortunately, the way we're looking out the window through the COAS, we can align the yaw and roll pretty well, but it's the - Sun that has to get us pitch.
103:47:43|C|Brand|Right. And - and a correction on this DEDA 470 thing. Request that we let you - Give you a GO before you trim. Over.
103:47:57|T|LMP|Say - Say again, Vance, on that last.
103:48:00|C|Brand|Roger. We would like to see address 470, and give you a GO before you trim. Over.
103:48:10|T|LMP|Oh, okay. I - I see. Okay. After burn, we'll leave 470 up a while and wait for your word to do the trim.
103:48:18|C|Brand|That's correct. How was the sleep?
103:49:59|T|LMP|Okay. And  -
103:50:15|T|LMP|Okay. Vance, are you there?
103:50:17|C|Brand|Roger. Go ahead.
103:50:21|T|LMP|Okay. The picture that Jim gave me on his view through the COAS was we'd have the - the partial Earth, the lit portion laying in the top half of the COAS with the cusp laying right on the Y-Y line. And so the - The whole dark part of the Earth would be at the bottom part of the Earth, except a very thin crescent of the dark part to a line - line above the Y-Y line.
103:50:59|C|Brand|Okay. That is correct.
103:51:00|T|LMP|And that in essence - that in - Yes, that in essence would put our X-axis pointing toward the Sun.
103:51:07|C|Brand|That's correct. The plus X-axis pointing toward the Sun and perpendicular to the terminator of the Earth.
103:51:18|T|LMP|Okay.
103:51:20|C|Brand|Two other points, Fred. One is that we don't expect hardly any misalignment of your engine for the burn, so we don't really expect any rates throughout the length of the burn, especially since it's at very low thrust. Second point, request you verify that your suit temperature rheostat's in FULL COLD. That - if it - If it were in FULL COLD, that might help your cabin temperature situation. It might bring the temperature up.
103:52:02|T|LMP|Okay.
103:52:19|T|LMP|Okay. The latter was a good point. We had it in FULL HOT.
103:52:24|C|Brand|Very good.
103:52:25|T|LMP|And Roger on the - Roger on the rates, too.
103:52:30|C|Brand|Okay.
103:53:18|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. Is the T<sub>ig</sub> time going to be approximately - Is it 105 or 105:30?
103:53:26|C|Brand|It's 105:30.
103:53:31|T|LMP|Okay. Your 104:30 time to start in is - sounds pretty good. That'll give us lots of time to get set up with the attitude business, in case we have any trouble stopping PTC and getting there and - That will give us a little time to be sitting and waiting, all set up.
103:53:49|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. Good.
103:58:53|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
103:59:00|T|LMP|Are you calling, Vance?
103:59:02|C|Brand|Right, Fred. We just noticed a 2-pound drop in your water quantity. Have you guys had a drink recently or do you know any reason why it might have dropped? Over.
103:59:16|T|LMP|Negative.
103:59:21|C|Brand|Thank you.
104:00:28|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
104:00:33|T|LMP|Hi. Go ahead, Vance.
104:00:35|C|Brand|Fred, that may be a funny in the data. The rate's gone back to normal; and we'll keep an eye on it, but we don't think you should worry about it too much.
104:00:50|T|LMP|Let's hope not.
104:11:21|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 104 hours, 11 minutes. Apollo 13 now 155,111 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity is 4,399 feet per second. We are an hour and 18 minutes away from the nominal midcourse burn time. As you heard Vance Brand tell the crew, this burn is insensitive or relatively insensitive at least to time and, if for some reason the crew is busy and can't make it at that time, they could at their option slip this burn as much as 30 minutes. However, at the present time we expect it will be done very close to the nominal time of 105 hours, 30 minutes. Approximately 30 minutes later at 106 hours we still expect the burst disc on the supercritical helium tank of the LM descent stage to go and vent that helium tank overboard. We'll continue to stay up live for air-ground conversation.
104:19:06|T|LMP|And, Houston, Aquarius.
104:19:07|C|Brand|Go ahead, Aquarius.
104:19:12|T|LMP|Are we going to get any sort of a PAD on this?
104:19:20|C|Brand|That's affirm, Fred. Estimating we'll have it to you in about 15 minutes.
104:19:28|T|LMP|Okay.
104:19:47|T|LMP|And, Houston, you might just let us know if there's any chance it's going to slip further down the road, because we're going to kind of hold to that 104:30 start time. And if you're going to delay any, we'll delay accordingly.
104:20:03|C|Brand|Roger. We won't have any trouble making that, Fred, I'm told.
104:20:12|T|LMP|Okay.
104:31:01|T|CDR|Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
104:31:08|C|Brand|Go ahead, Aquarius.
104:31:12|T|CDR|Roger. We have about 104:30 now. How's that PAD coming, so we can start our powerup?
104:31:23|C|Brand|Okay. FIDO's hustling here. We'll try to get it right up to you. Stand by.
104:32:10|T|CDR|...
104:32:13|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
104:32:18|T|CDR|We have ...
104:32:37|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
104:32:41|T|CDR|Vance, we have the quad heaters on, now.
104:32:44|C|Brand|Roger. Copy, Jim. And the - Jack's going to read you the PAD right now, so I recommend you go ahead and get started. You shouldn't be delayed by the PAD at all.
104:33:24|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. I've got your burn PAD.
104:33:37|T|CDR|Roger, Houston. Stand by. Are you ready - Stand by to copy. Okay. Ready to copy.
104:33:43|C|Lousma|Okay. A P30 maneuver pad on the DPS: purpose is midcourse 5, NOUN 33, 105:30:00.00, NOUN 81 is N/A, H<sub>A</sub> is N/A, perigee, plus 0019.8, 0.007.8, 0.15, the rest is N/A. Shut down the engine at 1 second prior to the end of burn time. Shut down at 14 seconds manually. Ullage is four jets for 10 seconds, 10-percent throttle. Go ahead.
104:35:00|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. We've got a DPS midcourse 5: NOUN 33, 105:30:00.00; NOUN 81, N/A; H<sub>A</sub> N/A; plus 0019.8, 0007.8, burn time 0.15, the rest of the pad, N/A. Shut down manually at 14 seconds, ullage four jets for 10 seconds, and the entire burn is at 10-percent throttle.
104:35:36|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. I want to verify that your DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> is 0007.8.
104:35:48|T|LMP|Okay. I read you back 0007.8.
104:35:53|C|Lousma|Okay. Good readback. You got it.
104:36:05|P|PAO|The CAPCOM on that call was Jack Lousma. We passed up the PAD for this midcourse correction. The time 105 hours, 30 minutes elapsed. DELTA velocity 7.8 feet per second. A burn time of 15 seconds with the notation to shut down the engine manually at 14 seconds. The targeting for the perigee after this burn 19.8 nautical miles versus present perigee of 87 nautical miles.
104:37:53|P|PAO|And at 104 hours, 37 minutes, Apollo 13's distance from Earth is 153,971 nautical miles, velocity 4,421 feet per second.
104:38:38|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston, I have some additional entry data that goes with the PAD I just read up. It's five items. Let me know when you're ready to copy. It's on a maneuver PAD.
104:38:55|T|LMP|Okay. I'll try to squeeze them in there, Jack. I'm rapidly running out of PADs.
104:39:08|T|LMP|Go ahead.
104:39:11|C|Lousma|Okay. It's N/A all the way down to NOUN 61. Your latitude is minus 21  -
104:39:20|T|LMP|Hold on a minute; hold on. You need the - Hold on, Jack, I need the other PAD book, that CSM PAD.
104:39:26|C|Lousma|That's affirm.
104:39:45|T|LMP|Okay. Now I'm ready.
104:39:47|C|Lousma|Okay. NOUN 61: latitude, minus 21.67, minus 165.37, 1163.1, 36292, 142:41:02. Read back.
104:40:20|T|LMP|Okay. NOUN 61; minus 21.67, minus 165.37. 1163.1, 36292, 142:41:02.
104:40:43|C|Lousma|Good readback.
104:41:42|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 104 hours, 41 minutes. The splash coordinates for which this burn is targeted are 21.67 degrees south, 165.37 west.
104:42:32|T|LMP|And you should have high bit rate now, Jack.
104:42:51|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. We're getting it now.
104:46:42|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
104:46:44|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
104:46:47|T|CDR|Did you have readouts on our quad temps to know when we can start? We're taking a time hack. We'd just like a verification with you.
104:46:55|C|Lousma|Roger. Your quad temps look good from here.
104:50:03|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We're going to stop PTC at this time.
104:50:09|C|Lousma|Roger, Aquarius. Go ahead.
104:52:51|C|Lousma|How about if you do  -
104:52:56|T|LMP|Say again, Jack.
104:52:59|C|Lousma|Negits on my last, Fred.
104:53:12|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. How do you read now?
104:53:20|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
104:53:26|T|LMP|Okay. I thought you called, Jack. We're maneuvering around here to fish for the Earth.
104:54:26|T|LMP|And, Houston, Aquarius. How's the ASA package temp look now?
104:54:52|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. The ASA package temp is looking good. It's around 98 degrees, and we'd like to see it go up about 15 to 20 degrees.
104:55:03|T|LMP|Okay. Why don't you give me the word before I proceed with the AGS. We really don't need it right this instant.
104:55:10|C|Lousma|Roger. We'll be watching it.
104:58:11|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. The ASA package temp is up now so you can activate the AGS.
104:58:19|T|LMP|Okay. Very good.
105:02:08|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. So we can make sure and get our timer set here, I wondered when your - you've got about 48 minutes to the burn which should be coming up pretty quick - you'd give us a hack so we could set our event timer at 12.
105:02:32|C|Lousma|Roger, Fred. I understand you want a mark at 12 minutes prior to the burn. Is that affirm?
105:02:39|T|LMP|Roger. We think we got it set now. We just wanted to check it. If we don't, then I'll set it to 13, and you can give me another hack at 47 to go.
105:02:56|C|Lousma|Okay. We got 33 to go.
105:02:59|C|Lousma|MARK.
105:03:03|C|Lousma|My mistake. It was 33  -
105:03:05|T|LMP|Right on.
105:03:06|C|Lousma|Roger. It was reading 33 on my mark. Right?
105:03:32|T|LMP|Okay. You got about 105:03 GET now down there?
105:03:39|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Fred. Going through 105:03:45.
105:03:44|C|Lousma|MARK.
105:03:48|T|LMP|Okay.
105:04:03|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. Give me the next number you want me to set then, and I'll take another hack here.
105:04:08|C|Lousma|Roger. You're counting up, right?
105:04:12|T|LMP|Roger.
105:04:49|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. On my mark, be 35 minutes to the burn.
105:04:58|T|LMP|Standing by.
105:05:13|C|Lousma|We missed her, Fred. Let's get it on the next minute.
105:05:17|T|LMP|Okay.
105:05:52|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. On my mark, it's going to be 24 minutes to the burn, and you'll be reading 36. Stand by.
105:05:59|C|Lousma|MARK.
105:06:03|T|LMP|Okay. We got it cranked up.
105:08:40|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 105 hours, 8 minutes. Following this burn, passive thermal control will be reestablished, and the command module pilot, Jack Swigert, and the lunar module pilot, Fred Haise, will begin a 6 hour rest period.
105:09:27|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We will wait until the burst disk on the super critical helium goes before we reestablishing passive thermal control, however. Apollo 13 now 152,604 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity 4,450 feet per second.
105:10:29|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We have our attitude set.
105:10:35|C|Lousma|Roger, Jim.
105:10:39|T|CDR|I hope the guys in the back room who thought this up ... knew what they were saying.
105:10:50|T|LMP|And I'm looking through the AOT there, Jack, and the Sun's right in the top and it's about maybe 2 degrees to the right of the cursor. So that looks real good.
105:11:01|C|Lousma|Roger. Good going.
105:12:04|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. The attitude looks good here and your choice when you want to start the burn.
105:12:16|T|CDR|We're counting down, aren't we, or do you want us to start any time?
105:12:22|C|Lousma|Your choice.
105:12:28|T|CDR|You guys are getting easy.
105:12:32|C|Slayton|It's not time critical, Jim.
105:12:36|T|CDR|I understand.
105:15:59|T|LMP|And, Houston, we reset our clock and we're making the burn in about - I'll give you a hack here at 2 minutes to go.
105:16:11|C|Lousma|Roger, Fred. And let us know when you're going to ullage, will you?
105:16:16|T|LMP|Okay.
105:16:25|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by. 2, 1.
105:16:28|T|LMP|MARK it.
105:16:29|T|LMP|Three minutes to go. Correction, 2 minutes to go, Jack.
105:16:34|C|Lousma|Roger. Two minutes. We got it.
105:17:01|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Check engine gimbal off, please.
105:17:07|T|LMP|It's verified to off.
105:17:28|T|LMP|And - MARK it.
105:17:29|T|LMP|One minute.
105:17:31|C|Lousma|Roger, Fred.
105:17:58|T|LMP|ENGINE ARM to DESCENT.
105:18:18|T|LMP|ULLAGE.
105:18:35|P|PAO|Ignition.
105:18:40|P|PAO|The thrust looks good.
105:18:48|P|PAO|It shut down.
105:18:48|T|LMP|Okay. You're looking at 470.
105:18:53|C|Lousma|Roger. We copy 7.4.
105:18:59|T|LMP|Roger. 7.4 and I had about 0.2 showing, I guess, when we started.
105:19:05|C|Lousma|Roger. We verify that, Okay, Aquarius. Trim it to 7.6.
105:19:18|T|LMP|Okay. You want plus-X now to get 7.6. Is that correct?
105:19:23|C|Lousma|That's affirmative.
105:19:42|T|LMP|Okay. You're looking at it, Houston.
105:19:46|C|Lousma|Okay. Looks good. Nice work.
105:19:51|T|LMP|Let's hope it was.
105:20:23|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. We're ready to follow you through on setting up PTC and powerdown. Your choice.
105:20:30|T|LMP|Okay. We're pressing into getting PTC established right now.
105:23:06|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 105 hours 23 minutes. That trimming was done with the reaction control system. The burn looked good. FIDO will want to get some tracking now and look at that for awhile before he can tell precisely what was achieved. Decision has been made to go ahead and reestablish passive thermal control prior to the super critical helium tank venting. There's enough uncertainty into the time when that will vent now that we're going to go ahead and establish the PTC. We can expect venting anytime up to and within the next 2 hours probably. We'll continue to standby for live air to ground transmission.
105:26:49|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to change the number of yaw pulses we gave you before as 21. We'd like to reduce that to 12. Twelve pulses yaw right, and that'll take you about 3 seconds to get them in if you don't want to count them.
105:27:08|T|LMP|Okay. We'll make it 12 versus 21.
105:29:50|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm just about there now and as soon as I get 90, we'll start damping rates.
105:29:57|C|Lousma|Roger, Aquarius.
105:31:22|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Jim Lovell setting up the passive thermal control now. We're reading a pressure in the super critical helium tank of 1,834 pounds per square inch. The burst disc range is 1,881 to 1,970 per square inch. The latest prediction is that we'll reach the lower limit, the burst limit, the lower burst limit 1,881 at in about an hour and a half. We're predicting a rise rate of 33 pounds per square inch per hour right now.
105:33:58|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm trying to damp rates now. We're at the proper roll attitude and pitch.
105:34:05|C|Lousma|Roger, Aquarius.
105:34:22|C|Lousma|Working a little bit better this time.
105:34:29|T|CDR|Are you copying any attitudes down there, rates, et cetera?
105:34:56|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. We're seeing some extremely low rates at this time, really below our capability to measure them.
105:35:09|T|CDR|Roger.
105:35:21|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 105 hours 35 minutes. The flight dynamics officer expects a fairly reasonable estimate of the trajectory in approximately 2 hours.
105:36:25|T|CDR|Houston, I think I've got pitch and roll just about squared away. I let yaw just slightly drift; it's drifting in a clockwise direction and I'm about all set now to put in my 12 clicks to the right.
105:36:44|C|Lousma|Roger, Jim. Ready to look at it with you.
105:37:14|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 105 hours, 37 minutes. Ignition time of that midcourse burn was 105 hours, 18 minutes 32 seconds. The total duration of both the descent propulsion system and the trim burn was 15.4 seconds. DELTA V achieved was 7.6 foot per second.
105:37:59|T|CDR|Twelve clicks right.
105:38:13|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. Are we clear now to proceed with the powerdown?
105:38:22|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Fred. We're ready to press on with powerdown. I've got two changes for you. Step 1 of the emergency powerdown on page power dash 5. Over.
105:38:35|T|LMP|Go ahead.
105:38:37|C|Lousma|Okay. Leave your POWER AMPLIFIER switch in PRIMARY <i>vice</i> OFF and put your RANGING switch to RANGE, <i>vice</i> OFF/RESET.
105:38:53|T|LMP|Okay. We're in PRIM in the POWER AMP and RANGING on RANGING.
105:38:59|C|Lousma|Affirmative.
105:39:11|T|CDR|Okay. I'm going to pull. Well, here, let's just look at the checklist.
105:39:14|T|LMP|Okay. Configure CBs. There you go.
105:39:18|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston, hold off 1 on powerdown, please.
105:39:23|T|LMP|Okay. We'll hold off. And we're looking at a SHe pressure, incidentally, of about 1830 now.
105:39:37|C|Lousma|Roger. We concur with that. And it looks like you got a little pitch rate going on here. Do you copy the same?
105:39:58|T|LMP|Not - Wait, wait. There you go.
105:40:07|C|Lousma|Just hold off on it 1, Jim. We'd like to take a look at it.
105:40:14|T|CDR|Okay.
105:40:21|C|Lousma|Aquarius, we'll need high bit rate, please.
105:40:26|T|LMP|Uuuuh - flashlight, Jack. Jack, flashlight over here a minute.
105:40:31|C|Lousma|Aquarius, we need the POWER AMPLIFIER back in high bit rate please.
105:40:37|T|LMP|You got it.
105:40:48|T|CDR|You got a couple in the roll pretty soon.
105:41:02|T|CDR|Aaaaah what is it, 1.7?
105:41:10|T|Unknown crewmember|...
105:41:34|T|CDR|You have another set of them by the PGNS.
105:41:36|T|Unknown crewmember|...
105:41:44|T|CDR|Now we got to turn off the heaters you wanna save  -
105:41:59|T|CDR|What's that flitting out there in the breeze? Are we venting again? Take a look, Jack.
105:42:17|T|CDR|Well, once we get squared away, Joe, I think I am going to have to go to the space center and take a good healthy one and wee in to just about everything. I've held up long enough.
105:42:31|T|LMP|That's coming from above. Another one just - is just coming down over here. Well, there's the old terminator at Fra Mauro. We'd been landing about 2 hours ago, huh? Right on the  -
105:42:56|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
105:42:57|T|LMP|-  to the right of the terminator.
105:42:59|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
105:43:03|T|CDR|Just for information, although I thought I'd never have to use it, that technique looked like it was a pretty good one.
105:43:13|C|Lousma|Roger, Jim. And we'd like you to give us your idea of how the PTC looks. We're not sure we're seeing what we ought to here.
105:43:26|T|CDR|Okay. I still have my ball powered up and I'm coming around past 270 right now. I've got a slight roll and pitch offset in there. My pitch needle about halfway up and my roll needle is about 4 degrees over now.
105:43:48|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. With that info we'll go on the PTC, and let's proceed with the powerdown.
105:43:59|T|CDR|Okay. We'll proceed with the PTC and proceed with the powerdown. I guess if we have to we can re-establish PTC at a later date. Okay. Okay.
105:44:22|T|CDR|First row. Out. AGS.
105:44:31|T|CDR|Your AGS on?
105:44:33|T|LMP|My what? My what? Oh, yes. Go ahead.
105:44:38|T|CDR|Okay. The four INVERTERS of this AC BUS volt, Fred.
105:44:44|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
105:44:52|T|CDR|Okay. Let's - give us the last ... Jack, and I'll see if there all out. Okay? RCS SYSTEM A. That's in. TCAs are going off. Why do they need the ISOL valves in the ASCENT FEED in?
105:45:17|T|LMP|You're not sucking any power unless you take these switches and move them.
105:45:21|T|CDR|How come we pulled them out, then, in this burn?
105:45:23|T|LMP|Because you didn't want them to get moved inadvertently, I guess. It doesn't matter, Jim, they can be out or in in terms of powerdown. They just don't count.
105:45:46|T|CDR|Okay. I got 1, 2, 3.
105:45:54|T|CDR|ISOL valve should be in 2.
105:45:56|T|CDR|Yes. Okay. Third row. Attitude DIRECT CONTROL I still have in.
105:46:41|T|LMP|Jack, how do you read now in baseband?
105:46:44|C|Lousma|Reading you 5-square, Fred. How me?
105:46:49|T|LMP|Okay. I'll stay this mode, if it's all right, so we won't be hot miked.
105:46:56|C|Lousma|Roger.
105:52:28|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. You're cleared to open the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker and go to LOW BIT RATE, leaving the POWER AMP switch in PRIMARY.
105:52:40|T|LMP|Okay. I'll pull the prime S-BAND POWER AMP breaker and go LOW BIT RATE.
106:01:35|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 106 hours 2 minutes. We're in the midst of a shift change over here in Mission Control at this time. Flight Director, Milton Windler and the Maroon Team of Flight Controllers are replacing Flight Director, Gerry Griffin and the Gold Team. Our Capsule Communicator on this shift will be Astronaut, Jack Lousma. One of our large LM status boards here in Mission Control would indicate that the power down in the LM is completed at this time. During the burn, the power levels off the LM were running around 25 amps. We're now showing the power somewhere between 10 and 12 amps. The target level during the power down is to keep it to at least 14 amps, so we're well below the minimum target, and in very good shape on LM power at this time.
106:02:37|P|PAO|Flight Director Windler at this time is reviewing the status from each of his Flight Controllers, and at the present time Apollo 13 is 150,302 nautical miles from Earth. Travelling at a velocity of 4,498 feet per second. There will be a change of shift briefing. We do not have a time at the moment. We'll pass that along to you as soon as it is available. At 106 hours 3 minutes, this Mission Control, Houston.
106:04:25|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
106:04:28|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
106:04:33|T|LMP|About how far out are we now, Jack?
106:04:49|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. You're 150,000 miles and you're coming in at 4,500 feet a second. That's from the Earth.
106:05:01|T|LMP|Okay. We're at 100 - Yes. 150 K, 4500 feet a second.
106:05:01|P|PAO|"This is Apollo Control. Our LM control officer reports that - "
106:05:27|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, how much TTCA control did you have to do in the burn?
106:05:34|T|LMP|How much - What was that, Jack?
106:05:36|C|Lousma|How much control of the TTCA did you have to do during the burn?
106:05:44|T|LMP|I wasn't noticing Jim too much. I'd say I put in maybe about six or seven inputs. I don't think it ever got off more than a couple of needle widths.
106:06:02|C|Lousma|Roger, Fred. Thank you.
106:06:11|T|LMP|I think it's probably the same for Jim. I wasn't noticing his input but the - his needle was hanging in there pretty good.
106:06:20|C|Lousma|Roger. Thank you, Fred.
106:12:48|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Flight director Milton Windler has completed checking the status with each of his flight controllers at this time, and the general tenor all the way around was that we're in very good shape at the present time. A couple of the significant items discussed, the surgeon reported that the lithium hydroxide, the makeshift lithium hydroxide canister appears to be doing an excellant job. We're presently reading a carbon dioxide level of 1.2 millimeters of mercury. The LM TELCOM, reported that they're beginning to see the effects of the engine burn heat soak back into the helium tank and related rise in pressure in the helium, which would indicate that the burst disk may go a bit earlier than originally predicted, although the heat soak back had been expected. The plot that we have on the pressure rise in the helium tank would indicate the burst disk going sometime between 107 and 108 hours, ground elapse time. The range on the burst disk is 1881 pounds per square inch to 1970 pounds per square inch and somewhere between this pressure range we would expect the burst disk to go relieving the pressure on the super-critical helium tank. The flight dynamics officer reported that when we get the burst disk rupture, they will be observing what they call Doppler shift, to see what effect the venting from the helium tank has on the trajectory. If there is no effect on the trajectory, we would expect to have a preliminary data on the effects of the midcourse correction within about 2 hours. That would be about 2 hours after the burst disk ruptures. If on the other hand, there is some change in velocity as a result of the burst disk rupture, the flight dynamics officer said that it would be at least 5 hours before we had a preliminary estimate on the trajectory, the new trajectory.
106:15:18|P|PAO|We've noted that the communications has gotten somewhat noisier. This is related to the power down of the lunar module. One of the items that is turned off in the power down is the communications power amplifier. This increases the noise with respect to the signal and we do expect the communications to remain more or less noisier than they have been. This condition will vary as the spacecraft attitude changes and as the position of the antennas changes with respect to the tracking antennas on Earth. The flight plan at this time calls for the command module pilot Jack Swigert and the lunar module pilot Fred Haise to get about 6 hours of rest. Jim Lovell will stay on the watch in the lunar module. At 106 hours, 16 minutes, Apollo 13 is 149,706 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at speed of 4,509 feet per second. And the clock in Mission Control counting down to entry shows that we have 36 hours, 24 minutes until Earth entry. This is Apollo Control at 106 hours, 17 minutes.
106:33:40|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
106:33:45|T|CMP|I read you loud and clear, Jack.
106:33:48|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. What's your status, who's sleeping, and who's working?
106:33:55|T|CMP|Well, right now we're all three kind of working. Do you have any recommendations?
106:34:04|C|Lousma|Yes, looks like to us from here that you and Fred ought to get some sleep, and that you ought to eat in about 6 hours. And that the Skipper ought to go to bed about 113 hours.
106:34:23|T|CMP|Okay.
106:34:24|C|Lousma|I've got some other information. We shouldn't have some good dope on your trajectory for about 2 hours. Looked like to us that the burn was real good, however, and we're taking a close look at it, and we'll get back with you on that in about 2 hours from now. Another thing that we're expecting to have happen is that the SHe tank is going to reach its burst limit. The earliest time we predict this will happen will be at 107 hours on about 25 minutes. And the latest probable time is at 110 hours, and this is supposed to be a nonpropulsive vent, but you might hear it and you might see something.
106:35:06|T|CMP|Okay. That's good news. We were wondering about that. And I'll relay all the other information you gave me.
106:35:14|C|Lousma|Okay. And if the SHe tank does burst during this time frame before we get trajectory info, why, that will delay our trajectory info somewhat. Your consumables, your water is now good through 152 hours.
106:35:32|T|CMP|Jack, wait a minute. Let me copy some of this down.
106:35:34|C|Lousma|Okay.
106:35:48|T|CMP|Okay. I'm ready now.
106:35:54|C|Lousma|Okay. We're predicting that you still have more water than you need. And one thing we'd like for you to do is when you're going to sleep up there in the command module take a look through the optics and see if you can see any stars.
106:36:17|T|CMP|Okay, Jack, I will do. Jim and I were able to spot constellations from the windows of the LM when there's no venting taking place. Could you give me some time on these consumables, what you're predicting they're good for? I think you started to give them times, didn't you, or was I just hearing things.
106:36:56|C|Lousma|We started to give you some times. We think we might be able to give you some better ones pretty soon. But it looks like your water is good through 154 hours, and you've got tox on O2 through 272 hours, plenty of lithium hydroxide, and your amp-hours ought to be good through 199 or 200 hours. Over.
106:37:34|T|CMP|Okay; good. Copy that.
106:37:44|C|Lousma|We expect that your water rate is going to drop off and at the time, DELTA will go up to 160 - 165 hours quite shortly. Another thing we're interested in is what's your status on rest and medication.
106:38:03|T|CMP|Okay. None of us, I know of, had any medications, and right now as far as rest, I suppose we're no tireder than normally in this situation. I'm going to relay the work-sleep cycle.
106:38:20|C|Lousma|Okay. And don't forget to look through the optics when you go up in the command module.
106:38:30|T|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. I'll do that.
106:40:04|T|CMP|Jack, as luck would have it, we just now started to vent a little from the Command Module ... I did look at ... through the sextant ... particles and stars
106:40:46|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Sorry about that but there's too much background noise to read you. I think we'll have to wait until you come up on a new antenna. Over.
106:40:58|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. Go ahead now. I think can hear you.
106:41:03|T|CMP|Okay. Okay, Jack. I was going to say, as luck would have it, the command module picked this time to start venting again, so I probably won't be able to get a good hack out of stars out of the telescope.
106:41:20|C|Lousma|Okay. Thank you. And if you can think of it, when the time comes up, when you're not venting, how about remembering to take a look through them and give us a word?
106:41:31|T|CMP|Okay. Will do.
106:44:04|T|CMP|Houston, Aquarius.
106:44:24|C|Lousma|Go ahead. Over.
106:44:54|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 106 hours 45 minutes. The - 
106:45:01|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Did you call?
106:45:05|T|CMP|Yes, Jack. I just got a question. How long are you predicting our command module LiOH canisters to last in here?
106:45:20|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. We've got 14 cartridges that'll last 157 hours, plus we've got the LM primary cartridge with 23 hours, and we've got two PLSS cartridges with 7 hours apiece.
106:45:35|T|CMP|Okay. I was just curious as to how much time we've got out of these two cartridges.
106:45:42|C|Lousma|Stand by 1. I'll get a prediction on that. By the way, I hope you're keeping track of the ones you've used and the ones you've not.
106:45:51|T|CMP|Yes, right now, we have numbers 7 and 8 in the LM here.
106:45:59|C|Lousma|Roger.
106:46:03|T|CMP|They were two brand new fresh ones.
106:47:07|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The participants for the Change of Shift Press Briefing are leaving Mission Control now. We estimate that the briefing will begin in about 10 minutes, in the MSC main auditorium in the News Center.
106:48:36|P|PAO|While we're waiting for the information which Jack Swigert requested on the expected lifetime of the two current lithium hydroxide canisters, we might recap some of the conservation between Swigert and Capcom Jack Lousma. Jack Swigert reported the crew had taken no medication and he said as far as rest they're no more tired than normally in this situation. He said they planned to switch to a rest cycle as indicated in the flight plan as soon as it's convenient. Now we passed up a consumable status to the crew. Also the status on the super critical helium tank burst disk we expect will be within the range where the disk could rupture within a matter of minutes. We're presently showing the super critical helium tank pressure at 1,874 pounds per square inch. We'll hit the lower limit of 1,881 pounds per square inch shortly and we'll be advising the crew when that level is reached. Jack Lousma advised them that they likely will hear the disk rupture and may see something from the LM at the time it ruptures.
106:50:13|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. In regards to the CO<sub>2</sub> canisters, by the way the PCO<sub>2</sub> is reading 1.6 down here now. We expect that we can get 6 more hours out of the two canisters that we have there - 6 hours at least. However, at 112 hours, when we've got several people up, we're going to rig up two more and we have the new simplified procedure for doing this. However, in the meantime, should we need to have a canister change, we plan to switch to the LM primary canister. Over.
106:50:52|T|CMP|Okay. Copy that, Jack.
106:51:08|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, how's your PTC holding up?
106:51:14|T|CMP|Well, we got a little bit off Jack. The - It starts high in the LMP's window and goes low in the CDR window.
106:51:37|T|CMP|So we've got a little bit of a wobble on it. Of course, the command nodule venting doesn't help, either.
107:02:44|T|CMP|Houston, Aquarius.
107:02:46|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
107:02:50|T|CMP|Jack, in reference to your question about the PTC, on this last complete revolution, the Sun first appeared in the very top right corner of the LMP window, passed over the CDR window, and was visible through the overhead window, and now the Moon is - came pretty well through the center of both windows this last time.
107:03:20|C|Lousma|Okay. Thank you, Jack. Copied that.
107:07:23|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to get a little better idea of how PTC is going. So, what we'd like for you to do is what we did last time. That is to give us a reading on the center of the Earth and the center of the Moon on the - on the LPD.
107:07:49|T|CMP|On the LPD. Okay, It's shifted. Let's see, the Moon's gone by and the Earth didn't come into the LPD last time.
107:08:03|C|Lousma|Okay. But when it goes by the plane of the LPD, tell us where it was. Okay?
107:08:10|T|CMP|Okay. Will do.
107:11:03|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 107 hours 11 minutes. Our displays based on telemetry information from the spacecraft currently show that we have pressure in the super critical helium tank of about 1889 pounds per square inch. This is within the range where the burst disk on the tank could rupture. The range is roughly between 1881 pounds per square inch and 1970 pounds per square inch. During the last 10 or 15 minutes there's been a huddle around the flight directors console. The subject of the discussion is what procedure we use if the burst disk does not rupture as expected. The pressure in the tank should not go above about 2000 pounds per square inch. If the burst disk does not rupture, we would need to use an alternative method of depressurizing the tank. These alternatives involve either depressurizing by venting all at once or by venting in stages, a little at a time. And a decision has not been made at this time on how the tank will be vented in the event it is necessary. But those are the options that we have as it appears right now. You've also heard Jack Swigert aboard the LM reporting the relative position of the Earth and the Moon and the Sun as the spacecraft rotates in the passive thermal control mode. As these bodies come into view through the windows, we've asked him to give a relative position of the Earth and Moon on the landing point designated, the grid on the LM window which is calibrated and will give us a bit more precise information on how the spacecraft is maintaining it's passive thermal control attitude. At the present time now we show Apollo 13 to be 147,186 nautical miles from the Earth.
107:13:34|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. This pass, the Earth came into view at the top left-handcorner of the LMP's window and was going down. However, when it passed it wasn't as high up as the last pass. It did pass into view at the CDR window, but too high up to get an LPD reading.
107:13:57|C|Lousma|Roger. Understand it went high in both windows then.
107:14:04|T|CMP|Yes, last time it wasn't even visible in the CDR's window; this time it was visible if you squatted down, but too high up to get an LPD reading.
107:14:14|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. That's good. Thank you.
107:21:51|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
107:21:53|C|Young|Go ahead. Over.
107:21:57|T|CMP|Okay. The Moon came into view at the middle of the LMP's window, passed through the CDR's window at an LPD of 5 degrees.
107:22:11|C|Young|Roger. Understand.
107:31:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 107 hours 31 minutes. We're presently reading a pressure on the super critical helium tank of 1897 pounds per square inch. Our LM control officer just advised the flight director that he expects the most likely time for the burst disk on the super critical helium tank to rupture would be within the next 15 minutes or so. At that time our indication in Mission Control that the disk has ruptured would be a drop in the tank pressure to zero. We presently show a current on the spacecraft electrical power system of anywhere from 10 to 12 amps. This is well below the minimum that we'd like to stay under. We'd like to keep it down to at least 14 amps and since the spacecraft is then powered down, we've been well below that figure.
107:35:55|T|CMP|Houston, Aquarius.
107:35:58|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
107:36:02|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. On this pass, the Earth came into the view at the top part of the LMP's window, and we got an LPD angle on it as it passed through the CDR's window of a minus 4 degrees.
107:36:18|C|Lousma|Okay. A minus 4. Thank you, Jack  -
107:36:19|T|CMP|It's - it's above the - Okay. Are you familiar with the minus 4 being halfway through the sky part, huh?
107:36:28|C|Lousma|Affirmed.
107:44:43|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
107:44:47|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
107:44:51|T|CMP|Okay. On this pass, the Moon came into view at the top part of the LMP's window, came across higher. Jim estimates the LPD angle at a minus 15 degrees.
107:45:09|C|Lousma|Okay. A minus 15 on the Moon, and sounds like it's set up pretty well.
107:45:21|T|CMP|Everybody's happy with it down there?
107:45:55|C|Lousma|Aquarius, it's a little too early to tell exactly how the PTC is going. We'd like to get a few more points, so keep reading them off, and we're still looking for that SUPERCRIT to go anytime.
107:46:08|T|CMP|Okay.
107:59:10|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
107:59:13|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
107:59:17|T|CDR|The Earth was just fairly high in the LMP's window and across the 14 degree LPD line.
107:59:27|C|Lousma|Okay, Skipper; 14 degrees. Thank you.
107:59:39|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 107 hours 59 minutes. That report on the relative position of the Earth and Moon through the spacecraft windows is coming from Jim Lovell. That's the first time we've heard from Lovell recently. A check with the flight surgeon. As far as we know at this time, all 3 crewmen are still up. However, the fact that Lovell is now on watch might indicate that Jack Swigert and Fred Haise are planning to begin a rest period. In mission control, flight director Milt Windler has been discussing the situation with the super critical helium tank and what options we've got if the burst disk does not rupture as it is expected it will. And as we've mentioned before, at that time it appeared the options were either to vent the super crit - vent the pressure from the super critical helium tank at a series of small vents or to vent it all at once. After looking at the situation, it's been decided that the procedure, should it be necessary to relieve the pressure by venting would be to vent it all at once. In this event it is felt that the fuel in the fuel heat exchanger would be frozen and we would not be able to thaw it out again. This would render the descent propulsion system unusable for further maneuvers, however, we have adequate consumables in the LM ascent stage, adequate propulsion in the ascent stage. It's also felt that if a subsequent midcourse was needed probably closer into the Earth entry, we would be able to perform this midcourse using the ascent propulsion stage of the lunar module. The present pressure on the super critical helium tank as read from telemetry data here in mission control is 1913 pounds per square inch. The rise rate has slowed down somewhat. Recapping again the predicted range for the burst disk rupture is between 1881 pounds per square inch and 1970 pounds per square inch. We wouldn't begin to get concerned about the pressures on the super critical helium tank until it got up around 2000 pounds per square inch. And the LM control officer anticipates that we would not get up around the 2000 pounds per square inch in the event the burst disk does not rupture until about 114 or 115 hours ground elapsed time.
108:02:49|P|PAO|Experience we've had with ground tests on the super critical helium burst disk indicates that it should be rupturing around the pressure we've got now in the low 1900's. And we're continuing to watch that. The LM power is continuing to run as it has since power down between 10 and 12 amps, and we look very good in that respect. There's also been no change in the status of any of the other consumables aboard the spacecraft. They all continue to look quite good at this time. Apollo 13 is presently 144,958 nautical miles from the Earth, traveling at a speed now 4,613 feet per second. We're now 34 hours 37 minutes until Earth entry. At 108 hours 4 minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.
108:08:45|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
108:08:47|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
108:08:51|T|CDR|The Moon went by the LPD at 6 degrees, plus 6 degrees.
108:08:56|C|Lousma|Okay. The Earth at plus 6. Thank you.
108:09:02|T|CDR|That's the Moon, the Moon.
108:09:04|C|Lousma|Okay. The Moon. Thank you.
108:23:30|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
108:23:33|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
108:23:37|T|CDR|The Moon passed by at a minus 8 degrees on the LPD. No, that's the Earth. The Earth passed by at a minus 8 degrees.
108:23:48|C|Lousma|Okay. The Moon went by at a minus 8 degrees.
108:24:02|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. We got it. The Earth went by at a minus 8 degrees. On a basis of the data  -
108:24:08|T|CDR|That's right.
108:24:09|C|Lousma|On the basis of the data we have so far, your entry angle is 5.99. The block data we gave you on the PAD for a no-COMM midcourse-7 last night is no longer valid because we made this midcourse.
108:24:38|T|CDR|Okay. Understand, the no-COMM PAD is no longer valid because of the midcourse. Entry angle based on the last 2 hours' tracking is 5.99, and I take it you're going to keep tracking for some time now to see whether we need another midcourse or not.
108:24:55|C|Lousma|That's affirmative.
108:25:05|T|CDR|Are you planning any no-COMM midcourse at 134 and change anyway right now, or are you going to wait?
108:25:14|C|Lousma|We're discussing that now, Jim, and it looks like we're going to wait on the tracking. For the time being, since you're in the corridor, why, there's no need to pass it up. But we're going to keep looking at the tracking, and we'll probably come up with one.
108:25:34|T|CDR|All right. I'm not too sure what the venting is going to do to us so - when this SHe tank ruptures, what it's going to do for us.
108:25:47|C|Lousma|Roger. We don't presently expect the SHe tank to have any effect on your trajectory, and the pressure's up to 1921 now.
108:25:59|T|CDR|Hey, it's going a lot better than we ever expected. What a way to get a data point?
108:26:35|T|CDR|And, Jack, just think. You thought you we're going to sleep through all your watches.
108:26:41|C|Lousma|Say again, Jim.
108:26:48|T|CDR|I said, you thought you were going to sleep through all you watches.
108:26:58|C|Lousma|Well, you keep waking me up.
108:27:04|T|CDR|Sorry about that.
108:51:51|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 108 hours 52 minutes.The Flight Dynamics Officer hopes to have a preliminary set of numbers on the effects of the midcourse correction. At about 109 hours 30 minutes or a little over 37 minutes from now, the burn was targeted to give the spacecraft a flight path angle of minus 6.52 degrees at entry interface. Now we won't have a confirmation of this, of course, until the flight dynamics officer is able to complete the tracking and compilation of data to come up with some preliminary numbers. But the targeted value of that course was to give us a flight path angle of minus 6.52 degrees. The entry corridor which is the width of the flight path angle that we feel we can withstand is about minus 5.25 degrees to about minus 7.4 degrees of flight path angle. We're still watching the super critical helium pressure aboard the LM descent stage increase gradually. The pressure is now reading 1937 pounds per square inch. I would like to cover again the procedures which we mentioned have been worked out in the event that the burst disk did not rupture as it is expected to do. The burst disk, of course, is in there to relieve pressure on the tank, on the super critical helium tank when the pressure gets above a certain specified limits. The disk is designed to rupture at between 1881 pounds per square inch and 1970 pounds per square inch. In the event the disk does not rupture, Flight Director Milton Windler as flight controller has worked out a procedure that will be followed to relieve the pressure on the tank, and we see the pressure dropping at this time.
108:54:27|P|PAO|The Control Officer reports that the burst disk has ruptured. We just as we were making this announcement -
108:54:31|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. You notice anything?
108:54:37|T|CDR|Yes, Jack. I was just about ready to call you. Underneath quad 4, I noticed a lot of sparklies coming out.
108:54:50|C|Lousma|Did you hear or feel anything?
108:54:54|T|CDR|No, I sure can't, but I think it changed our - it changed out PTC. Let me check and see what the drift is.
108:55:09|C|Lousma|Okay. She's going down through 600 now.
108:55:18|T|CDR|I think we're probably going to have to reestablish PTC. Yes, we got pretty fast yaw drifting, Jack.
108:55:57|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. What are your plans?
108:56:01|C|Lousma|We're thinking about them right now. Did you say it yawed some?
108:56:08|T|CDR|Yes, I was in a right yaw and now I'm in a left, yaw; at a much faster rate than the one we put in PTC.
108:56:28|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. We're talking it over. Stand by.
108:56:51|P|PAO|While we're waiting for conversation to resume between the CAPCOM and Jim Lovell aboard Aquarius, we'll summarize the situation as we were talking about the procedure that would be followed in the event the burst disk did not rupture. Lo and Behold the disk ruptured. That occurred at a pressure of about 1937 pounds per square inch at 108 hours 54 minutes 40 seconds ground elapsed time. We saw -
108:57:20|T|CDR|What's the SHe tank down to now, Jack?
108:57:24|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. It's going through 125 pounds now. And we understood you to say  -
108:57:30|T|CDR|Okay
108:57:31|C|Lousma|-  that it reversed your yaw. Is that affirmative?
108:57:37|T|CDR|Sure did, Jack. It reversed my yaw completely and put in a little pitch, I think.
108:57:53|T|CDR|But more than anything, it reversed my yaw.
108:57:56|C|Lousma|Roger. Have you effectively established PTC in the opposite direction then?
108:58:04|T|CDR|Well, you could say that. I'm not too sure just what kind of pitch or roll I've got, coupled with the yaw. I just saw the Earth go by the LMP's window here, not too long ago at a rather faster rate than we had going the other direction.
108:58:38|T|CDR|Perhaps you can tell how fast I'm having to shift OMNIs.
108:58:42|C|Lousma|Yes, we can tell the COMM cycling back and forth.
108:58:52|T|CDR|Is that what they call a nonpropulsive vent?
108:58:56|C|Lousma|Right. I'd hate to see a propulsive one.
108:59:01|T|CDR|You and me both.
108:59:04|C|Lousma|It's going through 50 pounds now. So, are you seeing fewer sparklies?
108:59:12|T|CDR|Yes. Much fewer. Not any at all, now. I'm not sure whether that vent gave me reverse yaw and roll - left roll - that's - if that's what it gave me.
108:59:34|C|Lousma|You say you think it might have given you some left roll as opposed to opposite yaw.
108:59:45|T|CDR|I'm sure it gave me the yaw, Jack, but I'm not too sure ... with it.
108:59:50|C|Lousma|Okay. We'd kind of like to watch it, see what happens for a little while before we make a recommendation. However, we'll need some inputs from you on that.
109:00:02|T|CDR|Well, we're in no trouble up here as far as - as far the yaw goes. Everything's fine. It's faster than we had set up before. We just wanted to get into proper thermal constraint, and it's going to take me 15 minutes to get the thrusters up anyway.
109:00:58|C|Lousma|Okay, Skipper. We don't see any thermal problems as a result of this change. If we see some communications problems, we may have to do something different, but so far, so good. And we'd kind of like to hear from you on LPD numbers, if you get anything going by the window.
109:01:28|T|CDR|Okay. Will do.
109:02:03|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. The Earth just went through at an LPD of 26 degrees.
109:02:09|C|Lousma|Okay. The Earth went through at 26 degrees going the opposite direction this time - left to right. Is that right?
109:02:17|T|CMP|From left to right. That's affirmative.
109:02:32|C|Lousma|Of course, the only other thing that we'd be concerned about is what change in your velocity this might have had and what DELTA-V it imparted, and we'll have to look at that for a while before we are able to determine it. And, if there is no significant change, why, we prefer just to leave it the way it is.
109:02:54|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. We're going to get a time on a revolution here, and maybe that'll help you out.
109:03:02|C|Lousma|Right. And, for your information, the tank went at 1937.
109:03:11|T|CMP|That's two thousand - 1937?
109:03:14|C|Lousma|Right.
109:04:12|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. The Earth went through again at 18 degrees on the LPD.
109:04:19|C|Lousma|Okay. Earth at 18. Thank you.
109:04:23|T|CMP|Okay. And we didn't see the Moon that time.
109:05:41|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. The Moon went through that time at 32 degrees on the LPD.
109:05:46|C|Lousma|Roger. Moon at 32. Thanks.
109:08:27|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Well, we didn't get the Earth that time. The Moon came back through at about 10 degrees, and now we're getting to the Earth again. Stand by.
109:09:08|T|CMP|Okay. The Earth came through the LPD at 62 degrees that time. And the total time for the two revolutions, - I missed the Earth revolution before, but the total time for the Earth's two revolutions was 3 minutes and 50 seconds.
109:09:33|C|Lousma|Say again the time and the - and also the LPD number. You're in the background noise, Jack.
109:09:39|T|CMP|Okay. Okay, Jack. LPD that time was 62 degrees and that was for two revolutions, being at that ... we missed the Earth - The time before we didn't see it. And the time was 3 minutes and 50 seconds.
109:09:59|C|Lousma|Okay. Three minutes and 50 seconds. Is that rate uncomfortable for you?
109:10:34|T|CMP|Jack, Jim said it isn't uncomfortable. It's a little annoying as for the OMNI switching, and also he said it's kind of - He said this Earth/Moon relationship's kind of ... because he doesn't know when to ...
109:10:50|C|Lousma|Roger.
109:13:30|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. We've got a MASTER ALARM and we've got a battery light flickering.
109:13:36|C|Lousma|Okay. Copy a battery light. What battery?
109:14:16|C|Lousma|Aquarius, how about cycling the power temp monitor to find out which battery it is, please.
109:14:25|T|LMP|Yes. That's in work, Joe.
109:14:39|T|LMP|Okay. It's that same old friend, Jack, BAT 2.
109:14:54|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. I can hear you now. Say again, please.
109:15:01|T|LMP|Okay. It's the same old - same old one. The only light I'm getting is on BAT 2.
109:15:35|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. We copy - copy your same old friend, battery 2. Could you give us high bit rate for a while, please?
109:16:13|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. High bit rate, please.
109:16:19|T|LMP|How you getting it now, Jack?
109:16:23|C|Lousma|We got it.
109:16:26|P|PAO|That's rotation and communications officer reports we have high bit rate now. We're taking a look at the battery here in Mission Control to see if we see anything unusual. Battery 2 earlier in the - earlier yesterday caused a master alarm to go off. We took a look at it at the time and could see nothing wrong with it. The battery was put back on the line and at the time it was felt that the problem was a sensor problem rather than a problem with the battery itself.
109:20:54|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. You can go low bit rate, POWER AMP, OFF and DOWN VOICE BACKUP now. Voltages and currents look normal on battery 2; so ignore the battery light.
109:21:12|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. POWER AMP, OFF, back to low bit rate, and I'll go back to sleep.
109:21:21|C|Lousma|The battery light staying on?
109:21:30|T|LMP|Yeeah. We got a steady on BAT 2, BAT FAULT LIGHT and the battery caution light.
109:21:49|C|Lousma|Okay. And is the Skipper in the sack now?
109:21:56|T|LMP|Aah - say again?
109:21:57|C|Lousma|Is the Skipper in the sack now?
109:22:08|T|LMP|Okay. Hold on a minute, Jack.
109:24:17|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston.
109:24:22|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
109:24:24|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. Since the antenna switch is kind of annoying, we've talked them into buying only half of the data. If it gets too troublesome for you to switch antennas, why, just leave it on one antenna and we'll listen to you half of the time.
109:24:43|T|CDR|Okay. It's not really much trouble. That's all we're doing about it. We'll try to keep up with it. And you're satisfied with this attitude so far. I guess you're going to watch the thermal and find out whether perhaps we're going to some other PTC attitude.
109:24:55|C|Lousma|Roger. Thermal appears to be no problem. We're looking at what DELTA-V might have been imparted due to this, and it looks like we're not going to change the PTC attitude.
109:25:14|T|CDR|Okay. Then DELTA-V was a part of it; I hope it raised that angle a little bit.
109:25:44|C|Lousma|Yes. We'll be looking at the data here, and give you a better answer in next 30 minutes or so.
109:25:52|T|CDR|Okay. Meanwhile, back to the drawing board about nonpropulsive vents.
109:26:06|C|Lousma|And, with your kind of luck, it probably lowered the angle some more.
109:26:13|T|CDR|Thanks for the confidence.
109:26:43|C|Lousma|And, Jim, we're going to have a handover here pretty soon, about 3 minutes, we may lose uplink for 30 seconds or a minute.
109:26:54|T|CDR|Okay.
109:27:08|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 109 hours, 27 minutes. Capcom, Jack Lousma, was advising Jim Lovell that we'll be handing over from the tracking site at Goldstone, California to the Honeysuckle, Australia site in about 3 minutes. During this handover, for a period of about 30 seconds to a minute we will not be able to up-link to the spacecraft. At about 109 hours, 13 minutes the crew reported a master alarm and a battery light flickering. We had them turn up the, turn on the power amplifier and give us high bit-rate datas so that we could look at the batteries here on the ground. After a look at them they telemetered the LM electrical systems engineer in Mission Control. He said that he was confident the problem was the same one that we'd seen yesterday, in which we probably have a sensor problem rather than a problem with the battery itself, and the sensor is triggering the alarm. The crew is advised to put the battery back on line and leave it there. The super critical helium Burst-Disk ruptured at about 108 hours, 54 minutes, 40 seconds after reaching a pressure of 1937 pounds per square inch. Lovell reported at the time seeing particles coming off, and also the pressure of the escaping gas, which was thought ahead of time to be a - was predicted to be a non-propulsive vent, turned out to be a very much a propulsive vent. Lovell said that the spacecraft stack which had been rotating about its longitudinal axis at a rate of about 3 revolutions per hour. This rotational rate was stopped by the vent and started up again in the opposite direction, and it is now rotating about one revolution every 2 minutes. One revolution a little less than every 2 minutes, as compared with a revolution every 18 or 19 minutes in the opposite direction prior to the vent. So, that was very much a propulsive vent. Hence, the remarks from Lovell, back to the drawing board on non-propulsive vent. The crew asked if there was any problem with the rotational rate they had as far as the structure of the vehicle and the temperatures on board. After a review of this situation in the span engineering room it was reported that there would be no problem, either with vehicle temperatures or structure, leaving this rotational rate as it is, and we advised the crew to let it continue to rotate at that rate, and the only problem might be in switching from one antenna to the other. Now, this of course, is function -
109:30:30|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We're handed over. How do you read?
109:30:36|T|CDR|Read you loud and clear, Jack.
109:30:42|C|Lousma|Okay. I'm hearing you now, and the noise has come up again, but it will go down.
109:30:52|T|CDR|How do you read now?
109:30:53|C|Lousma|Okay. That's a lot better, and we figure your battery glitch was just that thermal switch triggered a mal - a CAUTION and WARNING, just cycled once, and triggered a MASTER ALARM again. We'll watch the batteries for you, since you don't have any CAUTION and WARNING on now.
109:31:13|T|CDR|Okay. Appreciate. that.
109:31:46|P|PAO|This is Mission Control. As we were saying, the only problem we, potential problem that we could see with the rapid rotation rate or the more rapid rotation rate of one revolution every 2 minutes might be that the crew would have to switch from one antenna to the next and it was felt that this might be troublesome, however, Lovell reported that it would be no problem and they would attempt to keep up with it. In the event that they miss an antenna switch we would lose data for perhaps 1 minute while the spacecraft rotated around in a position for the other antenna to be received on the ground. At the present time Apollo 13 is 140,934 nautical miles from the Earth. Our velocity is up now to 4,700 feet per second. The very gradual velocity buildup we've been seeing since crossing the sphere of influence line, the imaginary line in which the Earth's gravitational force becomes the dominant gravity force acting on the spacecraft, and we begin to see at that point a gradual acceleration due to Earth's gravity.
109:43:33|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. Your luck is holding. Tracking shows that your entry angle has gone up to minus 6.24. This is on the basis of all the data we've collected between the midcourse up to the time the SHe tank went. So, we'll continue to look at it, and see if SHe tank did anything to it at all. So it's - The data has gone from 5.9 to a minus 6.24.
109:44:07|T|CDR|That sounds pretty good. We're really getting in there.
110:00:53|C|Lousma|How are you doing, Jim?
110:00:58|T|CDR|Not bad. Not bad at all.
110:01:10|C|Lousma|Is Jack in the sack, or is he with you?
110:01:16|T|CDR|Jack and Fred both are trying to sleep. It's sort of humorous; Fred's sleeping place now is in the tunnel, upside down with his head resting on the ascent engine. Jack is on the floor of the LM, with a restraint system wrapped around his arm to keep him down there.
110:01:39|C|Lousma|You say Jack is on the floor, and Fred is with his head on the ascent engine.
110:01:46|T|CDR|That's right, with his feet up into the tunnel.
110:02:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 110 hours 2 minutes. That was Jim Lovell reporting that Fred Haise is sleeping at present time in a rather unusual position. Fred sleeping with his feet up into the docking tunnel, and his head is resting on the ascent engine cover which is on the floor of the LM. Relatively up-side down as you in a normal standing position in the LM. Jack Swigert sleeping on the floor of the LM.
110:07:38|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 110 hours 8 minutes. We estimate that the amount of velocity change imparted to the combined stack of vehicles by the disk rupture and the super critical helium tank was about 2/10 of a foot per second. This amount of velocity DELTA V addition to the spacecraft was able to stop the rotational rates in one direction and start them up in another. The rotational rate had been about 1 revolution every 18 - 19 minutes.
110:08:18|C|Lousma|Okay, Skipper. Your luck is really hanging in there. Your water's good up to 161 hours now.
110:08:26|T|CDR|Hey, that sounds great.
110:08:31|P|PAO|Jack Lousma just advised Jim Lovell that current estimates of water would indicate that he's got - the crew has sufficient water on the LM for 161 hours.
110:08:40|C|Lousma|That doesn't include PLSS water or command module water.
110:08:49|T|CDR|Okay. Jack, I'd just like to know what - what plans or thoughts being contemplated for the PLSSs or the OPS, whether we're going to use their LiOH canisters or take the devices back in the command module with us, or just what will be your plans.
110:09:15|C|Lousma|Yes. We're talking all that over now. We haven't decided.
110:09:22|T|CDR|Okay.
110:09:31|P|PAO|Jack Lousma was advising Lovell that we have - as I said before, about 161 hours of water on the LM ascent/descent stage based on current consumption rates and this does not include water in which we have available in the command and service module or in the portable life support systems, which would extend that margin somewhat beyond the 161 hours.
110:10:26|P|PAO|And for some 45 minutes or so a fairly sizable group - about a dozen people or so, have been gathered around the flight director's console, discussing the procedures to be followed during reentry. Lovell just asked Jack Lousma what their procedure was being planned for the oxygen purge systems, the emergency oxygen supply carried with the backpack and lithium hydroxide canisters available. On these, Lousma told him that we haven't reached a conclusion on that. The meeting going on around the flight director's console at this time, is involved with that sort of thing. As well as what procedures to be followed as far as jettisoning the LM and service modules - all of these things being considered and discussed.
110:11:21|P|PAO|At the present time Apollo 13 is 139,164 nautical miles from the Earth travelling at a speed of 4,745 feet per second. Also like to clarify again the situation with respect to the super critical helium tank and the burst disk which ruptured at about 180 [sic] hours - when the pressure got up to some 1937 pounds per square inch. This burst disk is in the tank for the express purpose of keeping pressure from going above levels which the tank can withstand. Had the disk failed to rupture, we had a backup procedure worked out whereby the tank would be vented manually. Of course, it was not necessary to put this backup into effect because the disk ruptured at about the level it was expected it would. With the burst disk rupturing, what we have effectively lost is the ability to resupply a pressure to the tanks as this pressure is drained off by burning the descent propulsion system engine. However, we do have what is called blow down capability in the engine. That's the pressurization that already exists and which is not lost by depressurizing the supercritical helium tank. This - the pressure that is in the propellant tanks remains there, is isolated from the supercritical helium tank and is not lost when the burst disk ruptures. With this pressurization we still have some 800 feet per second of DELTA V remaining and usable in the descent propulsion system engine.
110:14:58|C|Lousma|Everything's running real smooth over in Timber Cove, Jim.
110:15:05|T|CDR|Sounds pretty good. How about at El Lago?
110:15:11|C|Lousma|Same. Everything's smooth there, too.
110:15:16|T|CDR|Good.
110:23:19|C|Lousma|Jim, we've had a lot of people working on the entry procedures, and they'll be continuing to do so. We got a few ideas we'd like to toss at you so you can start thinking about them if you think you're in a position to discuss them without waking up the other guys. What do you think?
110:23:36|T|CDR|Yes, go ahead. It's okay.
110:23:40|C|Lousma|One of the first things we want to do is charge the battery in CSM, so we can get some LM power over there to do that, and we have procedures ginned up to do it. In regards to reentry, we're planning our last midcourse at 5 hours before entry interface, and, if we have to make one, that is. And then we'd like to jettison the service module at 4 hours and a half, roughly, before entry interface, and take the next 3 to 3-1/2 hours for taking pictures, cranking up the command module G&N, taking care of stowage, and other odds and ends. And we'd hang on to the LM until 1 hour before entry interface, and then we'd jettison that. And these procedures are going to be run integrated in the CMS and LMS tomorrow morning, and, hopefully, later on in the day, we'll do it again with Mission Control on the loop. A couple of other things we'd like to toss at you: one question is what do we do with the OPS. The thought is that there is adequate O2 in the command module and that the OPS represents high pressure source and a stowage problem, and people are thinking about leaving them in the LM. The other thing is that we think you might want to make this a suited entry, suiting up prior to LM jettison, because what we're doing is, when we jettison the LM, we're going to do it like we did in Apollo 10 - just let the beauty go, and if we weren't suited, why, we'd be betting on the hatch seal to take care of us. So we thought we'd toss these few ideas at you. Some of them are ones that are particularly pertinent questions at this time.
110:25:46|T|CDR|Okay. A suited entry would sort of impair the 1-hour LM jettison ... back and forth up to that time. ... impede our progress back and forth. ...
110:26:10|C|Lousma|We're losing you, Jim.
110:26:13|T|CDR|Okay. I think I've got you back. I guess the midcourse at 5 hours prior to entry ...
110:26:25|C|Lousma|Affirmative, Jim. Midcourse 5 hours prior to entry interface.
110:26:35|T|CDR|If that's the case, all I'm worried about is having that all squared away. It's long before that ... I want everything in its place. All the stowage cleared away, all the powerup ready to go and know exactly what to do and ... so that we can do the midcourse, and ... get into the command module, powerup, jettison the service module, and then know exactly how to get rid of the LM.
110:27:13|C|Lousma|Roger. All those procedures will work - will be worked out precisely, and we agree that the stowage and all of those peripheral details ought to be taken care of before midcourse.
110:27:31|T|CDR|And, I guess, that last midcourse, we'd want to start looking at midcourse fairly early, if we have the power to do so, mainly because of attitude control. This last time was fairly easy, but I'm not too sure how long we can continue to ... I have the confidence that if everything is under control as it is now, we'll probably be going long before entry.
110:28:09|T|CDR|One other comment, it seems about as cold as it is now, we'll probably be going into suits long before entry.
110:28:22|C|Lousma|Yes. That's what we were thinking.
110:28:50|C|Lousma|I guess the two things which are somewhat unresolved at the moment are what to do with the OPS and what to do about the suited entry. We thought we'd toss those at you to see what you thought about them.
110:29:06|T|CDR|Okay. As far as the OPS is concerned, if we have enough oxygen in the spaceeraft ... to get us through. I have no difficulty ... command module ... command module suit loop prior to entry. I was looking at both the PLSS and the OPS as sources of oxygen, and the PLSS also in the - in the front of the suit loop or ... circulate ...
110:30:06|C|Lousma|Jim, I'm sorry. We're not catching what you're saying. The COMM is getting kind of bad right now.
110:30:15|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. How do you read now?
110:30:18|C|Lousma|I've still got you with quite a bit of background noise, but if you talk up like that, I think we can hear you.
110:30:26|T|CDR|Okay. My only concern about using the OPS and/or the PLSS in the command module is how soon do we have to live off the command module consumables prior to entry, and the PLSS has a fan and has a lithium hydroxide cartridge, which we could utilize in the command module if we didn't want to use the command module system. Also, the OPS with it's oxygen ... right now ... command module late enough command module oxygen and electrical power is ... but I had just as soon leave both of those items back in the LM.
110:31:10|C|Lousma|It sounds like the general gist of your comments are that if things remain pretty much as they are now in the command module, you'd just as soon leave the OPS in the LM. Is that affirm?
110:31:24|T|CDR|That's affirm.
110:31:31|C|Lousma|Okay. And maybe you'd like to think over the suited entry bit a little while.
110:31:40|T|CDR|Okay.
110:32:01|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
110:32:02|C|Lousma|Go ahead.
110:32:06|T|CDR|Okay ... How we align the command module right for entry, especially if you have the LM attached. Over.
110:32:21|C|Lousma|Roger. That's one subject that's been getting a lot of attention, and let me see if I can get some general ideas on that at the moment.
110:32:33|T|CDR|Okay.
110:35:36|C|Lousma|Jim, I can give you the general idea of the proposed procedure for bringing the command module G&N up. It's the presently proposed one. We may come up with a better one, but there's what we're looking at right now. First thing we plan to do is to - using the LM COAS, sight on the Earth with the LM just as we did in the midcourse. Then we'll do a body-axis align, 400 plus 5 on the AGS, to put the AGS ball at 000. And then we can give you an AGS ball attitude to fly to, to point the CSM optics at the Moon. And, if you can see stars, why, we can use those too. Then we can give you an equivalent set of CDU angles to put into NOUN 20 and to torque the platform over. So, now we're coarse aligned. Then we do a fine align by shooting at the Moon and then at the Sun. Do you follow all that?
110:37:05|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. Let me see if I have it. What we do is point the LM at the Earth like we did for the midcourse COAS, and we do a body-axis aline on the AGS. Then you give us an AGS ball attitude to fly to, which we do in the LM, and then we ... point the ... at the Moon. Then you would update the - give us some CDUs to coarse align, then we can fine align ... on stars or the Moon or the Earth. Stand by. Okay. We had another MASTER ALARM, Jack. I don't see any lights down there, except the battery light's still there. You want - ... ECS display . Okay. And the number 2 battery still has a light on it. I suspect it may be the same problem that we had before ...
110:38:30|C|Lousma|Okay. Let us talk it over a second, and we'll tell you what to do.
110:39:00|C|Lousma|Jim, is the battery light kind of flickering?
110:39:06|T|CDR|Yes. That's affirm, Jack.
110:39:16|T|CDR|Yes. The battery light's flickering, and it triggers off the MASTER ALARM.
110:39:21|C|Lousma|Okay. Well, that - temperature sensor on battery 2 is kind of cycling back and forth and every time it does, it triggers a MASTER ALARM, Jim.
110:39:37|T|CDR|Okay. Same old problem, huh?
110:39:39|C|Lousma|Yes.
110:40:13|C|Lousma|And, Jim, finally on the P52, we're considering using the - the Moon and then the Sun for the fine align.
110:40:24|T|CDR|Okay. The Moon and the Sun for the fine align. Understand. We'll go through this again here in just a second ...
110:40:55|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. Once - Once I get the spacecraft at the proper attitude ...
110:41:22|C|Lousma|Jim, I didn't copy your last question due to background noise.
110:41:29|T|CDR|Okay. Once - Once we get the AGS ball aligned by ... Earth ... pass up to the command module coarse aligned ...
110:41:49|C|Lousma|After we do the body axis align on the AGS, we can tell you what attitude on the AGS ball to fly to in order to point the CSM optics at the Moon or at some star. And then we can, knowing where the optics are pointed, give you an equivalent set of CDU angles to put in NOUN 20 to torque the platform.
110:42:22|T|CDR|Okay. I see.
110:42:30|C|Lousma|That's the current thinking. It may change between now and tomorrow, but right now, that's the way it looks, Jim. It'll probably be some take-off on that anyway.
110:42:43|T|CDR|Okay. Are they planning on a G&N entry or using another system, like EMS or something like that?
110:42:54|C|Lousma|It will be a G&N entry.
110:43:01|T|CDR|Nothing like going first class.
110:43:06|C|Lousma|Yes. That'll be a switch, won't it?
110:46:00|C|Lousma|Jim, have you broken into the food locker in the LM yet?
110:46:06|T|CDR|That's affirm, Jack. I sure have. I just put a meal away.
110:46:14|C|Lousma|You say you did find everything in order in there, huh?
110:46:20|T|CDR|Yes, everything was great.
110:46:22|C|Lousma|Okay. I'll pass it.
110:46:40|C|Lousma|I had a question about that earlier.
110:46:46|T|CDR|Right.
110:48:13|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
110:48:16|C|Lousma|Go ahead.
110:48:19|T|CDR|I understand that one of your reasons for a suited entry is the fact that the command module hatch still has to be good. It doesn't seem to be any different, but in the other LM jettison ... our hatch is no better than other spacecraft.
110:48:58|C|Lousma|No, the situation, Jim, is that your hatch is as good as any other hatch but that we won't have a chance to verify it until so late in the game, like 1 hour before entry interface, in this case; whereas before, why, we had a chance to evaluate it in lunar orbit. Over.
110:49:23|T|CDR|Oh, okay.
110:49:27|C|Lousma|And that might make your time line a little too crowded, getting your suits on there at the last minute; say, less than an hour before entry interface.
110:49:44|T|CDR|Okay.
110:50:30|C|Lousma|Jim, the next action item we want to pursue is transferring some LM power up to the command module MAIN B so we can start charging battery, and I guess what we ought to do is start on that one when somebody else gets up to help you there. So, when you decide to get the other guys up, or to have someone help, why, let us know and we'll start working on that.
110:51:03|T|CDR|Okay. I'd like to have Jack, and Fred's ... that one. When in the time line are you planning for ...?
110:51:18|C|Lousma|Say again, Jimm. I did't catch that.
110:51:23|T|CDR|When in our time - What's the GET do you plan on ... this procedure.
110:52:07|C|Lousma|Jim, I didn't catch all of what you said, but I think you wanted to know when the procedure for entry are going to be available and read up to you. If that's the case, why, we're talking about 120 hours or so. As far as the - charging battery A, we want to do that as soon as the other guys get up to help you. We've already passed up some of that procedure, and we have a couple of DELTAs to it.
110:52:37|T|CDR|Roger. Jack's already up. He asked about the procedure ... curious when you want to do it. Did you understand that? ... Is that correct?
110:53:00|C|Lousma|Jim, we're having trouble hearing you. The next order of business is to charge battery A, and when you get somebody to help you there, why, we'll go ahead and get done with it.
110:53:13|T|CDR|Okay. Sounds good.
110:53:17|C|Lousma|And, before you start working on it let us know, because we've got some DELTAs to the battery charging procedure.
110:53:26|T|CDR|Roger. I'm putting Jack on the line now to copy down the DELTAs ...
110:53:54|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Go ahead.
110:54:02|C|Lousma|Aquarius, did you call?
110:54:06|T|CMP|Yes, Jack. I'm on the line. ...
110:54:17|C|Lousma|Okay. Go ahead now. I can hear better.
110:54:22|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Joe Kerwin passed me up the procedure for powering the CSM from the LM. Has it changed?
110:54:32|C|Lousma|Yes. If you'll get that out, I'll read you the DELTAs.
110:54:42|T|CMP|Okay. I've got it.
110:54:47|C|Lousma|Okay, The second step was in the LM circuit breakers panel 11 and 16: ASCENT ECA CONTROL, close, two of them. Cross that out. In the next line, we had BATTERY 5 NORMAL FEED, on; cross out BATTERY 5 and put BATTERY 6 in there. In the next line was  -
110:55:17|T|CMP|Jack ... Hey, Jack; I have for step 3, I have BAT 5 and BAT 6 NORMAL FEED, on. You just want BAT 6?
110:55:30|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. Just BAT 6, Jack. And the next line, you had BATTERY 1 and 3. Make that BATTERY 1, 2, 3, and 4. Just add BATs 2 and 4. All four descent BATs. And then the next two lines about waiting 30 minutes, cross that out. And the next line about BATTERIES 2 and 4 OFF/RESET, cross that out, too.
110:56:09|C|Lousma|And, Jack, the  -
110:56:10|T|CMP|Okay. Let me read  -
110:56:12|C|Lousma|Go ahead.
110:56:14|T|CMP|Let me read you all the steps as I've got them, Jack, and make sure we've got them right. CB ASCENT ECA, two, closed. Step 2 will now be BAT 6, NORMAL FEED, on. Step 3, BATS 1, 2, 3, and 4, OFF/RESET.
110:56:44|C|Lousma|Okay. That part's all right, Jack. And we had - about 11 or 12 steps for the command module. They go as is with no change. And then we had a couple of more procedures for the LM. Stand by 1.
110:57:12|T|CMP|Okay. Jack, let me read you command module procedures just to make sure I have them right, also.
110:57:18|C|Lousma|Okay. Go ahead with the command module procedures.
110:57:23|T|CMP|Okay. Connect LM and CSM umbilicals. Step 2, panel 5: LM POWER 1 AC and 2 AC, closed, circuit breakers. Step 3, panel 5: EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, closed. Step 4, panel 250, CB POWER ENTRY/POSLANDING closed. Then there's step 5: MAIN B BAT BUS B, closed. Verify MAIN BUS voltage, then switch the LM power to CSM. Step 7: CB MAIN B BAT BUS B, open. And on panel 250, BAT B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, open. Verify MAIN BUS voltage.
110:58:49|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. The CSM procedure's okay, and, then we had to go back to the LM and do something. And the first line is okay, cross out "BAT 5 and 6 OFF," delete that. And delete the next line also, that says "Panell 11 to 16 ASCENT ECA CONTROL, open." Then we had a couple of notes which remain the same. Go ahead.
110:59:20|T|CMP|Okay. I didn't get the notes, but I'll read you the steps as I have them now. One step, BAT 1, 2, 3, and 4 HI VOLTAGE, on, and we have at this point should have BATTERIES 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 ON. Is that affirmative?
110:59:39|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. So now we have BAT 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, ON, and I got two notes. Number 1 is: your circuit breaker protection limits - your circuit breaker protection - limits the current to 15 amps. Number 2 note is: now the umbilical between the LM and the command module is hot. And the MAIN BUS voltage can be monitored by selecting MAIN B.
111:00:46|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. These notes are: circuit breaker protection limits current to 15 amps. Note two, the umbilical between the CSM and LM is hot. I can monitor MAIN B for the bus voltage.
111:01:04|C|Lousma|That's affirm, Jack.
111:01:22|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. One question here. If we transfer power like this, we're not going to cut us short on power remaining in the CSM ..., are we ...?
111:01:37|C|Lousma|Say it again, Jack. I didn't get it.
111:01:43|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by. If we configure the CSM for powering off the LM, we aren't going to cut it short on LM power requirements to get us back in the entry interface, are we?
111:02:03|C|Lousma|That's a negative, Jack. According to the latest update, we've got ampere-hours out to 203 hours.
111:02:20|T|CMP|Stand by. ...
111:02:40|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. One question from Jim is, he wants to know whether the procedure has been tried ...
111:03:04|C|Lousma|Okay. Try it again, now, Jack. What did Jim want to know?
111:03:10|T|CMP|Okay. He would like to know whether the procedure has been tried and whether it has been found to be okay; and there's no danger of shorting out any of our batteries or anything we have on board the LM now.
111:04:20|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. This procedure has not been tried out as such; however, the hardware paths through which the current flows are the same ones which we used during translunar trajectory, and there's not a problem with shorting out a descent battery. Over.
111:04:47|T|CMP|Okay. I'll relay that to Jim.
111:05:09|C|Lousma|Jack, of course, the reason for all of this is that we see we're 20 amp-hours short on one of the entry batteries, and we've got to juice that up to get you home with.
111:05:25|T|CMP|Okay.
111:05:30|C|Lousma|Okay. Now, what we owe you from here on out is the actual battery A charge procedure, and then a procedure to turn this all around, again.
111:05:48|T|CMP|Okay. Do you have it there, and how long is it ...
111:06:15|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. I have the procedure in front of me. It's about 18 steps, and the reason it's so long is because we're starting from this basic configuration which we gave you earlier. It concerns a charge on battery A, of course, which is our low one. So, when you're ready to copy it, let me know.
111:06:40|T|CMP|Okay. Let's go at it.
111:06:46|C|Lousma|Okay. Are you ready to read - copy it?
111:06:53|T|CMP|Go ahead.
111:06:54|C|Lousma|Okay. On panel 250, circuit breaker BAT A, POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, close; on panel 275, circuit breaker INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, close. Next several circuit breakers are on panel 5; circuit breaker BAT RELAY BUS, BAT A, close; circuit breaker EPS SENSOR UNIT, AC BUS 2, close; CB EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC2, close; CB BATTERY CHARGER, MAIN B, close. Are you still with me?
111:08:28|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. I'll read back those steps you gave me so far. Panel 250 CB BAT A, POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, close, panel 275, CB INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, close; panel 5, CB BAT RELAY BUS, BAT A, close; CB EPS SENSOR UNIT, AC BUS 2, close; CB EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC2, close, CB BAT CHARGER, MAIN B, close.
111:09:06|C|Lousma|Okay. Good readback, Jack. The only one is number 1 - number 4. I didn't get your readback, but it's EPS SENSOR UNIT AC BUS 2, close. You got that?
111:09:22|T|CMP|Yes. I read that back CB EPS SENSOR UNIT, close.
111:09:30|C|Lousma|Okay. To continue - to continue on - the same panel, panel 5: circuit breaker, BATTERY CHARGER, AC POWER, close; circuit breaker BATTERY CHARGER, BAT A CHARGE, close; circuit breaker INVERTER CONTROL 2, close; circuit breaker INVERTER CONTROL 3, close; I've got a switch for you, MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C, OFF; and another switch, BATTERY CHARGE to AC2. Read those back.
111:10:51|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. CB BAT CHARGER to AC POWER, close. Stand by. Okay. I had to get a light here. CB BAT CHARGER, BAT A CHARGE, close; CB INVERTER CONTROL 2, close; CB INVERTER CONTROL 3, close; the two switches, MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C, OFF; and the second one, BAT CHARGER TO AC2.
111:11:30|C|Lousma|Okay. That's a good readback. How about reaching over there on your right-hand side and turning the BIOMED off? See if we can improve the COMM a little bit.
111:12:02|T|CMP|Okay. How do you read, now?
111:12:03|C|Lousma|Okay. I'm reading you real good now, and I want to verify that the main bus tie that we switched OFF was BAT Alfa Charlie.
111:12:15|T|CMP|That's verified; MAIN BUS TIE, BAT Alfa Charlie, OFF. And BAT CHARGER on AC2.
111:12:22|C|Lousma|Okey. And in panel 3, I've got a switch for you. AC INVERTER 2 to MAIN B.
111:12:39|T|CMP|Okay. AC INVERTER 2 to MAIN B.
111:12:42|C|Lousma|Okay. And switch INVERTER 2, AC BUS 2 to on; and another switch, AC BUS 2 RESET, to reset and center; switch BATTERY CHARGE to Alfa; switch DC INDICATOR select BAT CHARGER, and then what we want you to do is to report the charger current and voltage to MSFN every l0 minutes for the first half hour, and then once every 30 minutes after that. And that'll be on our call, Jack. Read back the switches that I just gave you.
111:13:58|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. It's panel 3, AC INVERTER 2, MAIN B; INVERTER 2, AC BUS 2, on; AC BUS 2 RESET to reset and center, BAT CHARGER to A, AC INDICATOR select to BAT CHARGER. Report amps and volts to MSFN every 10 minutes for the first 30 minutes, and then every 30 minutes on a MSFN call.
111:14:29|C|Lousma|Okay. That's a good readback, Jack. Now the only thing we owe you is a turnaround from this, which we will have.
111:14:40|T|CMP|Okay. Let me ask one question, here. About how long do you think it'll take to charge these batteries?
111:14:45|C|Lousma|It's going to take you about 15 hours.
111:15:09|T|CMP|Jack, about how many amperes of LM power will this 15 hours ... cost us?
111:15:21|C|Lousma|Stand by. We'll get it for you  -
111:15:22|T|CMP|How many, Jack?
111:15:26|T|CMP|Okay. He got it. He got the question.
111:15:49|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. That's going to take 120 amp-hours out of the LM, which is equivalent to 10 hours, which will put us back to 193 hours, and that's plenty.
111:16:07|T|CMP|Okay. Let me relay that to Jim here. It'll take 120 amp hours, which leaves us - which puts us back from 203 hours ... to 193 hours.
111:16:20|T|LMP|Yes, there's that much to spare.
111:16:35|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. One question here. If we have any problem setting up this LM power to the CSM, is the quickest way to get out of it, return to the normal configuration, as it is for me to just switch the LM POWER to CSM to RESET then OFF?
111:16:57|C|Lousma|Stand by 1.
111:17:02|T|CMP|I would like to give one quick step in case that gave Jim report some sort of problem for us to get out of it quickly.
111:17:11|C|Lousma|Okay. Let us talk it over for a minute, Jack.
111:17:16|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine. And while you guys are talking it over, you might read back - Have you got the procedure for reversing this? I'll copy that.
111:20:00|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Are you with me?
111:20:03|C|Lousma|Yes. We're still here, Jack. What we want to do is follow you through on this, so we're going to get high bit rate to do it. In answer to your question, to undo this procedure quickly, in the event a problem develops, be sure that you don't touch the LM POWER switch because it's got a RESET position. But the way to undo it; is go into the CSM and on panel 5 open two circuit breakers. And they're some of the first ones we read to you. Open LM POWER-1 MAIN B, and open LM POWER-2 MAIN B. You copy that?
111:20:45|T|CMP|Okay. Understand. If I want to get out of this real quickly, I have to open just two circuit breakers in the CSM; that's on panel 5, LM POWER-1 MAIN B, LM POWER-2 MAIN B.
111:20:58|C|Lousma|Okay. And before you go ahead with this, let's establish high bit rate and wait 1 on that. And then as we go through the procedure we want you to wait when you get power on MAIN B so we can take a look at MAIN B without any loads on it before we start charging the batteries.
111:21:31|T|CMP|Okay. I understand you want high bit rate on the LM or CSM just before we start this?
111:21:40|C|Lousma|That will be high bit rate on the LM, and stand by for it.
111:21:45|T|CMP|Okay.
111:21:52|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. Before we go ahead with this, what we want to do is read you the reverse - the normal reverse procedure.
111:22:56|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. I got the start on how you reverse this procedure. Ready to copy?
111:23:04|T|CMP|Go ahead, Jack.
111:23:06|C|Lousma|Okay. First you want to reverse the battery charge procedure. To do that, on panel 3, switch BATTERY CHARGE, off; AC INVERTER 2, off; panel 5, MAIN BUS TIE BAT Alfa Charlie, on, up; panel 250, circuit breaker BAT Alfa, POWER ENTRY, and POSTLANDING. open. Read back.
111:23:59|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. On panel 3, BATTERY CHARGER, off, AC INVERTER 2, off; on panel 5, MAIN BUS TIE Alfa Charlie, on; panel 250, CB BAT A, POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, open.
111:24:23|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jack, and then if you'll go back to the rest of the circuit breakers on that list, and just opposite - Open them all up. Stand by 1.
111:24:52|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. Go back to the battery charge procedure I gave you. And, in order to terminate charge, just - You'll just have to write "Open" or "Off" next to the circuit switch that I gave you. So on panel 250, that circuit breaker you've already opened; on panel 275, INVERTER POWER-2 MAIN B, open; panel 5, BAT RELAY BUS BAT A, open; EPS SENSOR UNIT AC BUS 2, open, EPS SENSOR SIGNAL AC2, open; BATTERY CHARGER, MAIN B, open; BATTERY CHARGER AC POWER, open; BATTERY CHARGER, BAT A CHARGE, open; INVERTER CONTROL 2, open; INVERTER CONTROL 3, open; you've already done the MAIN BUS TIE; and then BAT CHARGE switch to AC 1. Over on panel 3, you have already set the AC INVERTER 2 to OFF and then INVERTER 2 AC BUS 2, OFF; AC BUS 2 RESET to OFF. You have already put the BATTERY CHARGER switch to OFF; and your DC Indicator select to MAIN B. Over.
111:26:46|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Do you want me to read it back to you?
111:26:51|C|Lousma|No, if you've got something in the right-hand column for all of those, we don't want to have to do it. And now one more thing I owe you is how to untransfer LM power to the CSM, and I'll get that for you in a jiffy.
111:27:22|T|CMP|Okay. I'll be standing by to copy it.
111:27:25|C|Lousma|Okay. We have a last minute change to that.
111:30:23|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 111 hours 30 minutes. The procedure being read up to the crew by Capcom Jack Lousma, is for recharging one of the three entry batteries on the command module, battery A which is down about 20 amp-hours. A full load on the entry batteries is nominally about 40 amp-hours, and we understand the other two batteries, B and C are essentially fully charged. Battery A is down about 20 amp-hours and their plan is to replace the energy in the command module battery A with electrical energy from the lunar module. This procedure will require about 15 hours of charging time, and will draw a total of about 8 amps from the LM.
111:33:12|T|CMP|Houston, 13.
111:33:23|C|Lousma|Go ahead.
111:33:43|C|Lousma|I understand the question is what kind of heavy things can you store where the SRCs go.
111:33:50|T|CMP|Yes. They go down in the LEB underneath the computer, and the heavier things you have down there increases the L over D. We don't have any SRCs, so I was just wondering what heavy things - We could probably put some cameras, television cameras, things like that that normally pretty heavy down there in - that, in our SRC. No, we can't, put the in our SRC, but we could put them in that container down there which would help increase our L over D. Anything else you can think of would be greatly appreciated because we don't even have a throw away station, so we're down a little bit in L over D.
111:34:33|C|Lousma|Okay. Let me pass that question along, and get somebody working on it.
111:35:03|C|Lousma|Souvenirs, I guess.
111:35:09|T|CMP|What souvenirs? (Laughter) All I've got is a Marine Corps foxhole-digging shovel.
111:35:19|C|Lousma|You've got all you need then, buddy.
111:35:27|C|Lousma|Okay. Ready to copy the power removal from the command module/LM umbilical.
111:35:35|T|CMP|I'm ready to copy. Go ahead.
111:35:40|C|Lousma|Okay. This assumes that all the descent batteries are on line and ASCENT BATTERY 6 is on NORMAL FEED, as we said earlier. First thing you do is go in the CSM and look on panel 5 circuit breaker. LM POWER-2 MAIN B, open; LM POWER-1 MAIN A, open; circuit breaker EPS SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN B, open.
111:36:18|T|CMP|Hey, Jack.
111:36:20|C|Lousma|Go ahead.
111:36:31|T|CMP|Yes ... You got just a little bit scratchy there because of the antenna problem. Let me read this back to you.
111:36:53|T|CMP|Okay. What I got, Jack, was the procedure assumes that all DESCENT BATTERIES are ON, and BAT 6 is on NORMAL FEED. Now we're going into the LM and on panel 5, we take LM, or CB LM POWER-2, MAIN B, open. And that's as far as I got.
111:37:11|C|Lousma|Okay, the second one is on panel 5 also. Circuit breaker, LM POWER-1, MAIN A, open; circuit breaker EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, open. Okay, read those back for the CSM, and I'll give you some steps in the LM.
111:37:40|T|CMP|Okay.
111:37:58|T|CMP|Okay. CB LM POWER-2, MAIN B, open; CB LM POWER-1, MAIN A, open; CB EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, open. Stand by 1 here.
111:38:15|T|CMP|Jack, I don't think we ever closed CB LM POWER-1, MAIN A. We closed LM POWER-2, MAIN B, and LM POWER-1, MAIN B. Both of them on MAIN B.
111:38:36|C|Lousma|Yes, you're right. Both of them should be MAIN B.
111:38:42|T|CMP|Okay. Copy that.
111:38:47|C|Lousma|Okay. Ready to copy the LM?
111:38:52|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
111:38:55|C|Lousma|Okay. On panel 16 circuit breaker, EPS, BAT FEED TIES, two, open; and now you've got to listen real carefully for high volts and low volts, BATTERY 1, HIGH VOLTS, to OFF/RESET; BATTERY 2, LOW VOLTS, to OFF/RESET and then ON: BATTERY 2, HIGH VOLTS, to OFF/RESET and then ON; BATTERY 1, HIGH VOLTS, ON; and then the circuit breaker on panel 16, EPS: BAT FEED TIES, both of them, closed. Read back.
111:40:20|T|CMP|Okay. On the LM side of the house is on panel 16. CB EPS BAT FEED TIES, two, open; BATTERY 1, HIGH VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET; BATTERY 2, LOW VOLTAGE, OFF/ RESET then ON; BATTERY 2, HIGH VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET then ON; BATTERY 1, HIGH VOLTAGE, ON. Panel 16, CB BAT FEED TIES, two, closed.
111:40:56|C|Lousma|Okay. That's a good readback. It concludes the procedure going both ways and now we just have to stand by.
111:41:06|T|CMP|Okay, when do you plan to start this?
111:41:10|C|Lousma|Darn soon.
111:41:15|T|CMP|Did you say not soon?
111:41:17|C|Lousma|No, we're going to do it pretty soon, but we want to have high bit rate, and we don't want you to give that to us until we tell you.
111:41:29|T|CMP|Okay. I think I'll go back and try to undamp up there. Do you have anything more for the command module?
111:41:43|C|Lousma|We're discussing two items, but we don't have them ready right now.
111:41:56|T|CMP|One of them, I hope, is a foolproof alignment procedure.
111:42:37|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Just for curiosity's sake, does FIDO have any information as to whether that helium - that She tank dump affected our trajectory at all?
111:43:21|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. Our tracking data shows that since the helium dump, our entry angle has not changed from its value of 6.24, and somebody calculated that if we had a propulsive vent, that helium could roughly, at the maximum, only impart a DELTA-V of a half a foot per second or less, anyway. But we're continuing to track and as soon as we get some more info, we'll pass it along.
111:43:57|T|CMP|Okay. That's swell, Jack. Thank you.
111:44:00|C|Lousma|Sure.
111:44:01|T|CMP|Your 6.24 sounds good.
111:44:14|T|CMP|I'm still awake, I guess.
111:44:22|T|CMP|They said that it would be a while because they want to get high bit rate. They don't want to put high bit rate on just yet.
111:46:40|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius. We're ready. So we want some high bit rate. To do that, go over to panel 16 under COMM and close the PRIMARY S-BAND POWER AMPLIFIER. On your COMM panel  -
111:46:56|T|CMP|Okay. Okay, Jack. Wait 1. While - I'd like to get the whole crew up for this if you don't mind.
111:47:04|C|Lousma|Okay.
111:47:09|T|CMP|Jim, they're ready to start. Yes, you want to get Freddo.
111:47:20|T|CMP|We want to transfer some power - I want to go to high bit rate here first, then want to transfer LM power to CSM, Fred.
111:47:37|T|CMP|Okay, Jim, I'll give you the COMM.
111:47:40|C|Lousma|Aquarius, there's no great big rush. If you want to let Fred come up to speed slowly, why maybe that'll help out.
111:47:55|T|CMP|Okay. ...
111:48:47|T|CDR|And Houston, Jack is showing Fred the procedures before we start up.
111:48:57|C|Lousma|Say again, Jim.
111:49:02|T|CDR|...
111:50:27|C|Lousma|Aquarius, How do you read?
111:50:32|T|CDR|Loud and clear.
111:50:33|C|Lousma|Okay. I'm hearing you now. I think I missed your last transmission, Jim.
111:50:41|T|CDR|Okay. Jack is showing Fred the procedures. Want to get him familiarized with them, and how to get out of any problems before we proceed.
111:50:54|C|Lousma|Roger. No rush. Just let us know when you're ready. We don't want old Freddo to slip a gimbal there.
111:51:05|T|CDR|Yes. We're watching him.
111:53:24|T|CDR|Boy, if you took 120 hours out. Oh. Yes. Okay. Have I done what?
111:54:15|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
111:54:18|C|Lousma|Hello, Fred. Go ahead.
111:54:23|T|LMP|Okay, I guess the only question I have is in the first - the very first portion involving the LM here where it has me turn on the only BAT 6, and then turn off all the DESCENT BATTERIES. Are you still reading me?
111:54:53|C|Lousma|Okay. I read you until after turn off BAT 6 - Correction, turn on only BAT 6.
111:55:03|T|LMP|Okay, the question is "Only one ASCENT BATTERY BAT 6 on the line," immediately followed by turning off four DESCENT BATs. Is that correct?
111:55:18|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Fred. That question has been banged around and we decided to go that way.
111:55:38|T|LMP|Let's see, we will be powering other BUS via the CROSS TIE BALANCE LOADS breaker. Is that correct?
111:55:47|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, and we're reading a current of 11 amps right now.
111:55:55|T|LMP|Okay. Okay. I guess I'm ready, then. That's how many amps?
111:56:00|C|Lousma|And after you turn BAT 6 on the line, you might as well take a look at the BATs 1 through 4 and so forth, and make sure that it's okay to turn them off.
111:56:16|T|LMP|Roger. Are your ready, gang?
111:56:21|C|Lousma|Yes, we're ready for the POWER AMPLIFIER and the HIGH BIT RATE, and NORMAL VOICE, on the FUNCTION switch, please.
111:56:31|T|LMP|Okay.
111:56:58|C|Lousma|Okay, gang; we've got HIGH BIT RATE, now.
111:57:04|T|LMP|Roger.
111:57:29|C|Lousma|Okay, we see BAT 6, ON, and it looks good, Freddo.
111:57:38|T|LMP|Okay. Am I cleared to proceed with the next step, getting 1, 2, 3, and 4, OFF/RESET?
111:57:46|C|Lousma|Affirmnative. You're cleared for BATs 1 through 4, OFF/RESET.
111:57:54|T|LMP|Okay.
111:58:13|C|Lousma|Okay. Still looks good.
111:59:13|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. We need a call from you when to have Jack to proceed up into the Odyssey and start up there.
111:59:31|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius; and Jack can get with it right now.
111:59:38|T|LMP|Okay.
112:06:11|T|LMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We've completed the powerup and things look good upstairs. Are we GO for proceeding with battery charge?
112:06:28|C|Lousma|Okay, Aquarius; you're GO on the battery charge.
112:06:34|T|LMP|Roger.
112:07:36|T|LMP|Boy, this is really a switch, isn't it, Jack?
112:07:48|C|Lousma|That's an understatement. You're not known for that.
112:07:54|T|LMP|Yes. I think if you add up the - Yes - if you add up the operating time, I think the LM beats the CSM by a considerable margin on this flight.
112:08:33|C|Lousma|Grumman just hired you.
112:08:38|T|LMP|Yes.
112:08:51|C|Lousma|You're out there at 134000, coming in at about 4900 feet a second.
112:08:58|T|LMP|Very good.
112:10:04|C|Lousma|The SUPERCRIT tank went off at about 1937 just about like expected.
112:10:11|T|LMP|Yes. It - it also must of not did very much, except the rates. I was asleep then and I didn't hear a thing.
112:10:25|C|Lousma|Is the command - service module still venting?
112:10:36|T|LMP|Jack said it was just before he went up. Right now, the Sun's over there, and I can't really tell  -
112:10:42|C|Lousma|And -
112:10:42|T|LMP|-  I'll look again in a minute.
112:10:44|C|Lousma|We asked him a long time ago if he was able to see any stars out the optics. I don't think we ever got an answer.
112:10:52|T|LMP|Okay.
112:11:04|T|LMP|That's a pretty good sleep station I had rigged up, Jack. I took one of the sleep restraints out of the command module, zipped up in it, and then hooked the tie, right at the top of the zipper, onto the LM upper hatch handle. So it kind of held me there, and then just drifted up in the tunnel upside down with my face toward the hatch, so the sunlight didn't get in my eyes and that worked pretty good.
112:11:35|C|Lousma|Did you sleep pretty well that way?
112:11:39|T|LMP|Yes, no problem at all.
112:11:43|P|PAO|That's Fred Haise talking.
112:11:44|C|Lousma|Is Jim sleeping that way now, or is he standing next to you?
112:11:49|T|LMP|He's standing next to me.
112:11:51|C|Lousma|About time for him to go to bed.
112:11:57|T|LMP|Okay. The voltage upstairs is 34.3 and the charger is reading 2.5 amps.
112:12:06|C|Lousma|Okay 34.3 and 2.5. And EECOM says that's what he expects  -
112:12:11|T|LMP|-  pretty cold. Good.
112:12:17|C|Lousma|Say again your last.
112:12:20|T|LMP|They came - both came down here rubbing their hands, shivering. It's pretty cool upstairs.
112:12:33|C|Lousma|Are you keeping warm in the LM?
112:12:41|T|LMP|Yes. It's pretty reasonable down here.
112:13:25|T|LMP|Okay. And right now, it looks like ... right now, it looks like the command module isn't venting, Jack, so I'm going to try to take a look at the optics.
112:13:48|C|Lousma|Okay. You say it is not venting?
112:13:52|T|LMP|Yes. That's the word. We've just looked through the AOT and you can't see anything back there.
112:14:00|C|Lousma|Okay. And everything's fine in El Lago.
112:14:06|T|LMP|Very good.
112:15:42|C|Lousma|Aquarius, we're ready to secure the high bit rate.
112:15:48|T|LMP|Okay.
112:16:32|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius; how do you read?
112:16:38|C|Lousma|I'm hearing you with a lot of background noise, Freddo.
112:16:42|T|LMP|Okay. How now? I just switched OMNIs again.
112:18:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 112 hours 18 minutes. The crew at this point has successfully completed the transfer of power from the LM onto the Command Module Main Bus B, and from there into the Battery Charger which is charging Battery A, one of the 3 entry batteries used for entry and post landing electrical power aboard the Command Module. The hope is to bring this battery from its current level of 20 amp hours up to about 40 amp hours which would be essentially a full charge on Battery A. The other two batteries, Battery B and C already being at full charge. The charging operation on Battery A is expected to required about 15 hours, and it began at 112 hours, 12 minutes ground elapsed time. You heard Fred Haise report that Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert had gone into the Command Module to power up the Battery Charger and check on the readings there. When they came back down, Fred said they were rubbing their hands, and noted that it was a bit chilly in the Command Module.
112:19:26|P|PAO|At the present time Apollo 13 is 133,158 nautical miles from Earth and the spacecraft velocity is up now to 4,891 feet per second. We're 30 hours 20 minutes 50 seconds from reentry, and according to the revised flight plan at 112 hours the three crewmen should be getting something to eat and also you heard CAPCOM, Jack Lousma advise Jim Lovell that it appears to be about time for him to get a bit of rest. The crew rest cycle has been left up to them. Our flight plan on one of the large displays here in Mission Control has some suggested times for sleep, but the crew has generally been working out their own sleep schedules as convenient for them, and following it, and we don't have an extremely good idea of when they plan to in advance, but only add to the fact when they report to us that they have gotten some sleep. At 112 hours 21 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
112:23:45|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by.
112:24:08|T|LMP|The CMP is dotting across there. You'd be amazed at how proficient you get at transfering to the tunnel after the first 1000 times.
112:24:31|C|Lousma|I didn't get your last there, Freddo. We'd like you to verify that your POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker is open. .
112:24:44|T|LMP|Okay. That's verified. POWER AMPL breaker is open.
112:24:48|C|Lousma|Roger.
112:25:00|T|LMP|Okay, Jack; we've 34.6 volts and just a little skooch under 2.5 amps.
112:25:08|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. I copied 2.5 amps. Say again the volts, please.
112:25:15|T|LMP|34.3 and that was just a little bit below 2.5.
112:25:21|C|Lousma|34.3; thank you.
112:25:33|T|LMP|Okay, Jack. Vots were 34 point 6.
112:26:06|C|Lousma|Freddo, I didn't copy the last. Say again the voltage, please.
112:26:17|T|LMP|Okay, and the voltage is 34.6 - 34.6, amps slightly less than 2.5.
112:26:26|C|Lousma|34.6 and a little below 2.5. Thank you.
112:26:34|T|LMP|We're - the way we are torquing around to the side here, Jack - We are getting some intervals where I can't hardly get to it with either of the OMNIs.
112:32:52|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
112:32:54|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Hous - Aquarius.
112:32:59|T|LMP|Okay. Jack reports from upstairs that he can see stars and constellations out of the optics but the Sun angle is such that it is reflecting off the LM - portion of the LM quad and other thruster that happen to be in the field of view right now. ... really moving around ...
112:33:29|C|Lousma|Okay. The part I got was that he can see stars and constellations and there is some sunlight reflected off the quads. That's all I got.
112:33:41|T|LMP|Yes. The point being that, at least in the present orientation, you have to kind of wait until Sun isn't reflected off the LM to see them.
112:33:59|C|Lousma|Okay. What you're saying is you kind of have to wait until the - there is no Sun reflection on the LM to see the stars. Is that right?
112:34:08|T|LMP|Yes. That's for the present orientation, of course.
112:34:25|T|LMP|But later on, you can probably move it around and ... pick up stars.
112:34:35|C|Lousma|Okay  -
112:34:36|T|LMP|...
112:34:42|C|Lousma|Okay, Freddo. And we need a volts and amps reading.
112:34:56|T|LMP|Okay. And bring it back upstairs.
112:35:36|T|LMP|Okay. The volts, 35.0; amps, 2.4.
112:35:42|C|Lousma|Okay. 35.0 and 2.4. Thanks, Fred.
112:38:39|C|Lousma|The weather prediction for your landing area is still good; 2000 scattered, high scattered; 4-foot seas, 15-knots wind. There's a hurricane 500 miles to the west, which doesn't pose a problem.
112:39:02|C|LMP|A hurricane or a typhoon?
112:41:24|C|Lousma|Belay my last. It's degraded to a tropical storm.
112:47:17|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We need another readout amps and volts, and that will be our last one for a half hour. Over.
112:48:33|T|LMP|Okay. The reading is 37.8 volts, 2.3 amps.
112:48:40|C|Lousma|Say again, Fred.
112:48:43|T|LMP|37.8 volts, 2.3 amps.
112:48:49|C|Lousma|37.8 and 2.3. And that will be our last one for a half hour. Thank you. And I'm about to exercise my fifth general order here, and pass it along to Joe.
112:49:07|T|LMP|Yes. It must be getting around a mealtime.
112:49:39|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 112 hours, 50 minutes. We're in the process of a shift handover at the present time in Mission Control. Flight director Glynn Lunney is replacing Flight Director Milton Windler. The capsule communicator on the upcoming shift will be astronaut Joe Kerwin. At the present time Apollo 13 is 131,712 nautical miles from Earth. The spacecraft velocity is up now to 4,928 feet per second.
112:50:18|P|PAO|Repeating a figure passed on a little while ago, the flight dynamics officer reports that as a result of the midcourse correction the flight path angle at entry is within the entry corridor. The flight path angle currently appears to be minus 6.24 degrees at entry interface. The nominal flight path angle is 6.5 and that is what the midcourse correction was targeted for 6.24, a negative 6.24 degrees is within the entry corridor and a descision has not been at this time as to whether any subsequent midcourse corrections will be required. At 112 hours, 51 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
112:55:18|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 112 hours, 55 minutes. EECOM, the command module electrical and environmental control engineer reported that the power transfer to the command module main bus B is continuing to function smoothly and the battery charging operation also progressing well at this time. Battery A, one of three entry batteries aboard the command module, is being recharged, and EECOM reports that it appears to be taking a charge well. At 112 hours, 56 minutes Apollo 13 is 131,426 nautical miles from Earth and travelling at a speed of 4,935 feet per second. We're now 29 hours 44 minutes from reentry.
113:13:46|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
113:13:53|T|LMP|Go ahead, Joe.
113:13:55|C|Kerwin|Okay. This is your friendly do-it-yourself kit COMM with a suggested procedure in the lithium hydroxide situation. You're looking good. We read 1.8 millimeters, and you do have sufficient LM ... to last you the rest of the flight. However, being on the conservative side, we would like to use one more set of command module canisters to guard against some possible problems with the LM, primary canister. And I have a simplified procedure for doing that, if you want to listen to it now. Over.
113:15:15|C|Kerwin|Okay. I think I read that you were ready. Tome for the earphones ... This simply consists of getting a second pair of cartridges out of the command module, putting one band of sticky tape, that is the gray tape, with the sticky side out, around the sides of each new canister near the top, taking a piece of EVA cue card and cutting it into four squares about 2 or 3 inches on a side, bending those at a right angle to form corner supports, attaching them to the sticky tape, so that they'll stick up and overlap the old canister, and then simply putting the old canister next to the new canister and taping it up real good so it sticks together. The only other procedure is to remove the towel plug from the old cartridges and put it in the bottom of the new cartridge. And that's it. Over.
113:16:29|T|LMP|Okay. As I read you, we get the gray tape and fold it so that we get - the back sticks around the outside of the canisters, then we mount to that four sides of our stiff cards like our EVA cue cards; then we overlap those cards down around the base of the canister. Then we - then we ... over the ... at the top. ... Then we take the towel from the old ones and put them in the bottom of the new ones. ... ...
113:17:35|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. I think you got it. I didn't completely copy your readback, but it's just that simple. We're just putting the new cartridge - the top of the new cartridge against the bottom of the old one, moving that towel plug, using the cue cards as little corner stiffeners, and taping her up.
113:17:59|T|LMP|Okay. The top of the new against the bottom of the old.
113:18:03|C|Kerwin|Roger that. That way you don't have to touch the hose.
113:20:08|T|LMP|Hey, for a change, I can see a few land masses down there this morning, Joe.
113:20:16|C|Kerwin|Okay. Go ahead.
113:20:20|T|LMP|I got all ... looks ...
113:20:46|C|Kerwin|I'm afraid I didn't copy that, Fred, and while I was listening, EECOM told me that he'd like another battery charging readout.
113:22:31|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
113:22:34|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go.
113:22:38|T|LMP|You want us to start on this lithium right now, Joe, or is it necessary?
113:22:45|C|Kerwin|It's not time-critical, Fred, but if you have the people awake now, you might go ahead and do it. Incidentally, you probably know this, but the next several hours are going to be pretty quiet from our point of view. We're working on the entry procedures and should be ready to read them up to you in about 8 hours; and between now and then there's not an awful lot going to be going on, so you guys could be catching up on your sleep schedule. Over.
113:23:22|T|LMP|Okay, Joe.
113:23:24|C|Kerwin|And we would like another readout on the amps and volts.
113:23:31|T|LMP|Roger.
113:24:53|T|LMP|Okay. The volts, Joe, are 38.9 and the amps are 1.9.
113:25:01|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that, Fred. Thank you very much; 38.9 and 1.9. And EECOM is simply making as smooth a plot as he can to verify the amount of amps we're putting back into the battery. That's why he wants it at half-hour intervals. If that schedule begins to interfere seriously with your rest cycle or so, give us a call. Over.
113:25:34|T|LMP|Okay.
113:25:55|T|LMP|Yes. Jim's sleeping now, and Jack and I are awake and I just finished sleeping around, I guess, about another 5 or 6 hours, so I'm not particularly inclined to go back to sleep right now.
113:26:09|C|Kerwin|Okay.
113:28:46|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 113 hours 28 minutes ground elapse time. The Black Team of flight controllers is presently taking over here in the Mission Control Center. We're estimating about 15 minutes for the Change of Shift Press Briefing with Maroon Team Flight Director Milton Windler in the MSC main autorium. It appears that the shift will be primarily a sleep shift with a few minor items to be taken care of by the crew such as attaching additional lithium hydroxide canisters to the devices that were fabricated on board the spacecraft yesterday. Instead of taking the canisters out, they will simply attach another one in parallel with the canisters that are in the plastic bags attached to the SUIT hoses. Presently, Apollo 13 129,791 nautical miles out from Earth. Approaching at a velocity of 4,977 feet per second. At 113 hours 30 minutes ground elapse time and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
113:38:29|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
113:38:32|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
113:38:37|T|LMP|Okay. We've got one of them ready to go, and it looks like we could do a pretty good job just using the tape strips. First combining them together and then just using a piece of paper and the bag, get a pretty good seal that way, without using the card pieces.
113:38:54|C|Kerwin|Hey; okay, Fred. We suspected that you'd gotten at least one on. We've noticed a partial pressure drop from the 1.8 to 0.8, which is real good.
113:39:10|T|LMP|Okay. You might run that by the CPCB and see if they approve our in-house mods.
113:39:17|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
113:39:35|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
113:40:22|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
113:40:26|T|LMP|Go ahead, Joe.
113:40:28|C|Kerwin|Roger. We're convening the CPCB on that change, Fred, but FLIGHT has given you an interim go ahead. Over.
113:40:38|T|LMP|Okay.
113:45:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Participants in today's, this morning's change of shift press conference, Milton Windler, Maroon team flight director, is now en route to the main auditorium, should be starting within the next few minutes and this is Apollo Control.
113:55:51|T|LMP|And, how do you read now?
113:55:55|C|Kerwin|Not too bad, Fred..
113:55:59|T|LMP|Okay. We've got both canisters completed now.
113:56:03|C|Kerwin|Okay. Roger that, Fred. And you're reading 0.1 again on the CO2. Incidentally, are you guys having good luck getting water out of the command module?
113:56:17|T|LMP|We - We haven't tried that yet today.
113:56:20|C|Kerwin|Okay.
113:56:27|T|LMP|Yes. This is quite an apparatus hanging on to these hoses now. And that ECS design engineer looked at it, he'd ... because it sure seems to work.
113:56:42|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
113:57:27|C|Kerwin|And, Aquarius, Houston. At your convenience, we'd like another volts and amps readout.
113:57:36|T|LMP|Okay.
113:59:08|T|LMP|How do you read, Joe?
113:59:11|C|Kerwin|Pretty good, Fred.
113:59:14|T|LMP|Okay. Volts, 39.0; amps, 1.7.
113:59:21|C|Kerwin|39.0, 1.7. Thank you.
114:05:24|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead. You're pretty weak.
114:05:30|T|CMP|I didn't call you, Joe.
114:05:35|C|Kerwin|Say again.
114:05:39|T|CMP|I didn't call.
114:05:41|C|Kerwin|Oh, sorry about that. Incidentally, Fred, if switching OMNIs every couple of minutes bugs you, you can skip it for now. We can always wait until you come around.
114:05:54|T|CMP|No, it doesn't. This is Jack, Joe. Fred is upstairs. It doesn't bother me at all.
114:06:02|C|Kerwin|Okay.
114:06:03|T|CMP|Just happy to know that you're standing by.
114:06:06|C|Kerwin|Roger that. Except I'm sitting by.
114:06:19|T|CMP|Did that PCO<sub>2</sub> drop?
114:18:30|T|CMP|Joe, how far out are we now and how fast are we closing?
114:18:35|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. The plot shows you about 130 000 miles out, which is about, gee, 10 000 closer than you were when I came on a couple of hours ago. And let me check with FIDO for your rate of closure.
114:19:23|C|Kerwin|Hey, Jack. Over.
114:19:29|T|CMP|Go ahead.
114:19:30|C|Kerwin|Your smiling FIDO says you're making 5040 in a 5000-mile zone.
114:19:39|T|CMP|I can't ... I ...
114:29:41|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
114:29:46|T|CMP|Go ahead, Joe.
114:29:48|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jack. Hate to keep bugging you, but we would like another volts and amps reading. Over.
114:29:56|T|CMP|Okay. We'll get it for you.
114:29:58|C|Kerwin|Good show.
114:30:59|T|CMP|Joe, did our sticky MOD on that - those CO2 canisters work? ...
114:31:07|C|Kerwin|Jack, I think you asked if the canister MOD was working and the answer is, it sure as hell is.
114:31:49|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. I got the voltage, it's 39.0 amps 1.75.
114:31:58|C|Kerwin|Copy 39.0 and 1.75.
114:46:55|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 114 hours 46 minutes ground elapsed time. Rather quiet at the present time, very little communications with the spacecraft, which now is 126,029 nautical miles out from Earth, approach velocity 5,076 feet per second, electrical power usage hovering around 12, 13 amps, partial pressure carbon dioxide in the lunar module cabin 1/10th of a millimeter of mercury. The addition of the 2 command module lithium hydroxide scrubber canisters to the homemade device rigged up yesterday by the crew of Apollo 13 has reduced this quantity of carbon dioxide from slightly over 1 millimeter piped down to 1/10th. Apollo 13 total weight standing at 87,740 pounds. There goes a call I believe to the spacecraft.
114:48:57|P|PAO|Apparently it was an accidental nudge of the king switch at the capsule communicator's console causing the familiar beep beep sound. In some other spacecraft onboard readings we're showing now 33.17 pounds of oxygen in the descent stage, 2.25 pounds is ascent tank 1, 2.67 pounds ascent tank 2. Water quantities: Descent 51.9 pounds; ascent tank 1, 42.1; ascent tank 2, 42.1 pounds; cabin pressure, 4.98 pounds per square inch, showing a temperature of 51 degrees, which is - the measurement is taken at the outlet and does not represent the free air temperature in the cabin, which is probably up around 70.
114:50:18|P|PAO|As mentioned earlier, Apollo 13 gross weight of both vehicles is now 87,740 pounds. Of this weight 58,728 pounds are rocket propellant, about 29 tons. This computes out to 67 percent of the total vehicle weight in propellants. Apollo 13 is the fifth time that a manned spacecraft has made the return from the Moon. Apollo 8 back in December of 68 was a somewhat conservative approach using the command and service module only, and going into lunar orbit, having quite a large margin of propellant available to go into lunar orbit and to make transearth injection out of lunar orbit back toward Earth. Apollo 10, the all up spacecraft, went into lunar orbit, did everything but the actual landing, including the descent orbit down to about 8 miles above the Moon, stopped short of making the descent and here again there were adequate margins of propellant and with Apollo 11 the landing was made. And Apollo 12 was essentially a repeat as far as the amount of propellants and the spacecraft performance were concerned. At any rate, all of these had smaller amounts or smaller quantities of propellant available than Apollo 13 does at the present time. The service propulsion system propellant on Apollo 13 stand untapped at 40,796 pounds. This was for planned total DELTA-V or velocity change of some 6,975 feet per second with various vehicle combinations, not just command/service module alone, but in some cases, such as lunar orbit insertion and DOI where you have the total LM and command module combination, and others, the transearth injection where only the command and service module would use up some 3,147 feet per second. There are 11,093 pounds of descent propulsion propellant remaining. However, not all of this is available since the supercritical helium burst disc relief valve blew during the night. There's about 800 feet per second blow down or ullage volume in the descent propulsion tanks so not all of this 11,000 pounds are available. In the untapped ascent propellant tanks we have 5,242 pounds loaded. Service Module reaction control system 1342 pounds are still relatively untapped except for the small attitude usage that was made during the translunar coast prior to the time that the fuel cells gave up the ghost. In the Command Module reaction control system this is still a sealed dual ring system in the Command Module for attitude control during entry. There are 245 pounds of propellant available there. When the service module and lunar module are jettisoned prior to entry approximately 29 tons of what is jettisoned to enter the atmosphere and burn up will be propellant.
114:55:11|P|PAO|The spaceflight meteorology group of the weather bureau said this morning that weather conditions would be acceptable for Apollo 13's landing in the Pacific Ocean, Friday, April 17, and the planned recovery area which is centered about 560 miles Southeast of Samoa, skys will be partly cloudly with widely scattered showers. Easterly winds at 15 knots and seas about 4 feet are expected with 75 degree temperature. Helen a small, weak, tropical storm is predicted to be about 500 miles west of the recovery area and should not affect the landing or recovery of Apollo 13. Conversation underway with Apollo 13, let's join in.
114:55:46|T|CMP|Houston, do you read Aquarius?
114:55:51|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. That's affirmative.
114:55:55|T|CMP|Okay. We had a dropout there for a few minutes. ... on either antenna.
114:56:04|C|Kerwin|Gee whiz, Jack, I - when did it happen? Over.
114:56:13|T|CMP|Just now. I just got you back.
114:56:16|C|Kerwin|Okay. We had a handover, but that was about a half an hour ago, and I didn't call you on it. Let me check with INCO and see if he thinks everything's okay. Your COMM sounds just as good as it's ever been.
114:56:31|T|CMP|Yes. I'm in real good shape here.
114:56:54|C|Kerwin|Jack, Houston. Over.
114:56:58|T|CMP|Go ahead.
114:57:00|C|Kerwin|Roger. We're checking into it. We think we lost lock in Madrid for a while, and we've got it back now.
114:57:07|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine. ...
114:57:11|C|Kerwin|Okay.
114:57:13|T|CMP|You might also check with FIDO whether we hit that 19.8 perigee ...
114:57:23|C|Kerwin|You're getting a little weak. Did you say you wanted to verify what - what your vacuum perigee is? Over.
114:58:35|C|Kerwin|Jack, Houston. Over.
114:58:39|T|CMP|Go ahead.
114:58:41|C|Kerwin|Okay. The good FIDO gives us a vacuum perigee at the present time of 23.6 with a flight path angle of minus 6.25 degrees. That's without a midcourse. He's kind of tossing around the idea of doing a midcourse-7 maneuver at 5 hours before entry. If we do it, it looks like it won't be more than 2 feet per second. Over.
114:59:15|T|CMP|Okay.
114:59:50|C|Kerwin|And, Jack, Houston. We verified that that COMM problem was a ground problem.
114:59:59|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you. That FIDO is really cooking today.
115:00:03|C|Kerwin|Oh, he's having a ball.
115:00:08|T|CMP|It must be because we haven't made any waste water dumps.
115:00:11|C|Kerwin|(Laughter)
115:00:17|T|CMP|You can tell Jay and David that I went for a whole flight and didn't use the bathroom.
115:00:24|C|Kerwin|(Laughter) He copies that. David's here; he says you've kept him so busy he hasn't had time to work on his stereo all week.
115:07:54|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
115:07:59|T|CMP|Go ahead.
115:08:01|C|Kerwin|Jack, we'd like another volts and amps reading at your convenience.
115:09:25|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. It's 39.2 volts; 1.6 amps.
115:09:34|C|Kerwin|Okay. Thank you. We copy; 39.2 volts, and 1.6 amps.
115:09:42|T|LMP|Right.
115:14:36|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 115 hours, 14 minutes ground elapsed time. Some of the other clocks in the mission control operations room here showing time to entry, 27 hours, 25 minutes, time to ignition on midcourse correction number 7, I suppose, 9 hours, 56 minutes, this would be if done, it would be about 2 feet per second to lower the vacuum perigee from its present 23.6 miles to around 20 nautical miles. Apollo 13 now 124,626 miles out from Earth, approaching at 5,114 feet per second. Predicted velocity at 400 000 feet, or entry innerface, 36,210 feet per second; velocity would build up at the time of perigee of 23 miles to 36,431 feet per second. The prime recovery vessel Iwo Jima is steaming toward the aiming point in the Southcentral Pacific and its estimated arrival time at the aiming point is at 9 AM Central Time on the 17th. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide still holding at 1/10th of a millimeter of mercury in the lunar module cabin; cabin pressure 4.98 pounds. Holding steady. At 115 hours, 16 minutes, 115 hours, 17 minutes ground elapsed time, and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
115:28:53|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 115 hours 28 minutes ground elapsed time. To correct an earlier error regarding mid-course correction burn number 7, the clock at that time was showing 9 hours to ignition. Now it's showing the correct value of 22 hours 11 minutes, which is entry interface minus 5 hours. At 115 hours 29 minutes, this is Apollo Control standing by.
115:38:41|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
115:38:46|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go.
115:38:50|T|CDR|I just relieved the watch; just thought I'd find out how things are going.
115:38:56|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. Good morning; and understand you relieved the watch, and the rest was kind of blurry. Did you have any questions?
115:39:09|T|CDR|No questions, Joe. Just one of those establish communications.
115:39:10|C|Kerwin|Okay. That was - That was loud and clear, that one there. Now we don't have a heck of a lot going on as you know we're working on the entry procedures. I've got preliminary copies, but we're not ready to pass - to pass it up to you. Looks like you're about 125,000 miles out, starting to - starting to really pick up speed, and the Astros won last night, and that's about all I've got. Over.
115:42:21|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
115:42:26|T|CDR|Go ahead.
115:42:29|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. It's about time, at your convenience, for another volts and amps reading on the command module. For your information, we put 6 amp-hours back in the battery already and we've got about 14 to go. It's looking real good, and I also just got the word that the entry weather tomorrow is looking better all the time. Really looks great.
115:42:55|T|CDR|That's good. When I went to bed last night, we were talking about a hurricane.
115:43:04|C|Kerwin|Didn't copy that, Jim. Sorry.
115:44:11|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
115:44:14|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
115:44:17|T|CDR|Roger. 39.2 on the volts; 1.4 on the amps.
115:44:23|C|Kerwin|39.2 and 1.4. Thank you.
115:44:54|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
115:45:00|T|CDR|Go ahead, Joe.
115:45:01|C|Kerwin|Roger. Just for your information, in case it happened when you were off watch, the master caution circuit breaker is still pulled, and we're seeing the - the malfunction indication on the descent battery now, but all the parameters still look just as good as ever, and that's just for information.
115:45:28|T|CDR|Okay. I see the battery light flickering now.
115:45:33|C|Kerwin|Okay. Recommend you ignore it.
115:45:37|T|CDR|Okay.
116:26:40|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
116:26:44|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
116:26:46|C|Kerwin|Jim, it's volts and amps time again, at your convenience.
116:26:53|T|CDR|Okay.
116:28:31|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
116:28:35|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, Aquarius.
116:29:27|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. If you gave me those readings, I didn't copy them. Over.
116:29:51|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. Do you read?
116:29:53|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Okay; go ahead.
116:29:58|T|CDR|Volts, 39.3; amps, 1.25.
116:30:06|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copied 39.3 and 1.25. Jim, did Jack tell you what your trajectory looks like? Over.
116:30:18|T|CDR|Haven't got up to speed on it. How about giving me a rundown?
116:30:21|C|Kerwin|Okay. We are looking at a vacuum perigee right now of 23.6; flight path angle of minus 6.25; and if we decide we want to trim that up, we're looking at a midcourse of about 2 feet per second. Your consumables, of course, are getting better all the time; we've got 163 hours of water, 230 hours of oxygen, and 172 hours worth of electrical power. Over.
116:30:55|T|CDR|That sounds good.
116:30:56|C|Kerwin|Roger.
116:35:50|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 116 hours 35 minutes ground elapsed time, the spacecraft position now 120,598 nautical miles out from Earth, approach velocity 5,227 feet per second, countdown clocks now showing 26 hours 4 minutes to entry interface or 400,000 feet above the surface of the Earth. Time to ignition or mid-course correction burn number 7 now tentatively 21 hours 4 minutes. This is entry interface minus 5 hours. Cabin pressure still holding at 4.78 in the lunar module, average voltage or amperage usage still hovering around 12, 13, 14 amps in the lunar module, vehicle weight still 87,740 pounds. At 116 hours 37 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.
116:46:13|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. An advisory to newsmen in the Houston News Center. Donald K. (Deke) Slayton, Flight Crew Operations Director at Manned Spacecraft Center is now enroute to the main auditorium for the 10:00 briefing. Should arrive there within about 5 minutes. This is Apollo Control.
117:00:36|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
117:00:40|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
117:00:42|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We would like to get another check from you on the propellant tank temperatures, as we did yesterday. And the procedure is to, on panel 16, circuit breaker PROPELLANT, DISPLAY/ENGINE, OVERRIDE/LOGIC to close. Then go to your display and read the tank 1 and tank 2 temperatures for us, and then open the circuit breaker again. Over.
117:01:14|T|CDR|Okay. I'm closing now - the DISPLAY/ENGINE, OVERRIDE/LOGIC.
117:01:18|C|Kerwin|Roger.
117:01:26|T|CDR|Okay. And the reaction control temperatures are 65 in A and 65 in B.
117:01:34|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We'd like the descent tank temperatures, too. Over.
117:01:59|T|CDR|67; oxidizer is 63; descent tank 1 fuel is 64; the oxidizer is ... Did you copy? Over.
117:02:22|T|CDR|Hello, Houston. Did you copy the - the DPS display temperatures?
117:02:27|C|Kerwin|Jim, I copied 63 and 64, which I think were the descent 1 temps, and that's all I got.
117:02:37|T|CDR|Okay. I'll go over it again. I'm on descent 1, now and fuel is about 64, and oxidizer is 65, and I'll go to descent 2  -
117:02:47|C|Kerwin|Okay. Thank you very much  -
117:02:48|T|CDR|-  our descent 2. Okay. I've got descent 2 now right up on 67 and 66.
117:02:55|C|Kerwin|Roger. We copy that, and once again we'd like to get the volts and amps check in the command module. Over.
117:03:07|T|CDR|Okay. I'm going to go up there and get it. Jack is - and Fred are asleep, so I'll be off the air a minute.
117:03:12|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real good.
117:05:31|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
117:05:33|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go.
117:05:37|T|CDR|Volts, 39.3; amps, 1.26.
117:05:45|C|Kerwin|Okay. We copy 39.3 and 1.20. And, Jim, I've got one more item for information for you. At - In about 45 minutes or so, you will get an H2O quantity caution light on the descent tank. We expect this. It occurs at 16 percent. And it's no problem, because we intend to run the tank dry just for drill. To reset the - the light, on panel 2, just set the O2 H2O QUANTITY MONITOR to the CAUTION/WARNING RESET position and the light will go away. Over.
117:06:26|T|CDR|Okay. I understand. We're going to get a H2O warning light here shortly, and I'll reset it.
117:06:35|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good deal.
117:30:21|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control 117 hours 30 minutes ground elapsed time. Apollo 13 now 117,810 nautical miles out from Earth. Approach velocity 5,308 feet per second.

117:34:07|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 13.
117:34:12|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston; go ahead.
117:34:16|T|CDR|Okay, Joe, we just got the WATER warning light.
117:34:20|C|Kerwin|Okay. Roger that.
117:46:57|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
117:47:02|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
117:47:04|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. The experts would like another volt and amp reading.
117:47:11|T|CDR|Okay; have them stand by.
117:47:13|C|Kerwin|Okay, no rush.
117:49:46|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
117:49:49|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston; go ahead.
117:49:53|T|CDR|Voltage is 39.3, amps 1.26.

117:51:17|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
117:51:19|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston; go.
117:51:24|T|CDR|Joe, you might pass to our friends in Crew Systems that lunar boots make great footwarmers.
117:51:31|C|Kerwin|I guess you need them up there, too. Is - is anybody sleeping in the command module right now, Jim?
117:51:39|T|CDR|Negative, Joe. It's just too cold in there. I got Fred stashed over here to my left. He's asleep and Jack's sleeping on the engine cover. 
117:51:46|C|Kerwin|Roger.
117:52:22|T|CDR|You can eliminate the chilldown procedure for reentry.
117:52:27|C|Kerwin|(Laughter) Well, we figured we were in that mode now.
117:52:56|P|PAO|Velocity now 5,342 feet per second. Henry H. Wilson, Jr., President of the Chicago Board of Trade has forwarded the following message to the Mission Control Center: "The Chicago Board of Trade will suspend trading at 11 A.M. today for a moment of tribute to the courage and gallantry of America's Astronauts and a prayer for their safe return to Earth." At 117 hours 53 minutes ground elapsed time and standing by, this is Apollo Control.
118:08:49|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 118 hours, 8 minutes ground elapsed time; at the present time in the Houston News Center main auditorium, is a briefing just beginning with Mr. Keith McClung of North American Rockwell who will discuss the various hardware aspects of the Friday morning entry of Apollo 13. This is Apollo Control, standing by.
118:25:50|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, this is Earth. Over.
118:25:55|T|CDR|Go ahead, Earth; Aquarius here.
118:25:57|C|Kerwin|Roger. Earth is here, also; and, Jim, it is time for another one of those volt/amp checks. For your information, we've got that battery back up to 30 amp-hours now. Over.
118:26:10|T|CDR|Hey, that sounds great. Jack's gone up to check it.
118:26:17|C|Kerwin|Roger.
118:26:34|T|CDR|Aquarius, Earth.
118:26:37|C|Kerwin|Go ahead.
118:26:41|T|CDR|You know, I think Aquarius is becoming a ...
118:26:49|C|Kerwin|We've got garble now, Jim; I'm sorry.
118:26:55|T|CDR|I said Aquarius ...
118:26:57|C|Kerwin|Roger.
118:27:25|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
118:27:27|C|Kerwin|Go ahead.
118:27:30|T|CDR|Voltage 39.3, amps 1.26.
118:27:36|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that, Jim.
118:27:56|C|Kerwin|Jim, Houston. Have you guys put on any extra clothes to try and ward off the nip of Jack Frost? Over.
118:28:06|T|CDR|Well, the lunar boots and two pair of underwear, and everyone is ... crawl into their sleep restraints.
118:28:14|C|Kerwin|Yes.
118:28:15|T|CDR|We're a little reluctant to break out the suits.
118:28:18|C|Kerwin|Yes, that's understandable. You can always use them if you have to. I guess it's pretty hard to get extra coveralls on, huh?
118:28:44|T|CDR|Well, Joe, I didn't think we had any extra inflight garments aboard, but we're going to check right now.
118:28:50|C|Kerwin|Well, stand by.
118:43:33|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
118:43:36|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
118:43:38|C|Kerwin|Roger. Jim, we noticed you just went to AUTO and back to CLOSE on the SUIT RELIEF valve. Is everything okay?
118:43:48|T|CDR|We didn't do that intentionally. Stand by.
118:43:54|C|Kerwin|Okay, maybe you didn't. Incidentally, you're less than 24 hours to go.
118:44:00|T|CDR|Roger. What happened was, our lithium hydroxide device here got caught in the suit relief valve. It is closed now. That's where you want it, right?
118:44:12|C|Kerwin|Okay.
118:44:30|C|Kerwin|Okay.
118:44:45|T|CDR|And, Joe, just a reminder; now that you mention it - that it's less than 24 hours to go, what I'd like to do, and I have aboard all the procedures that you are working up; so I can run through them with the crew, and make sure that we get all our signals straight.
118:45:05|C|Kerwin|Roger that, Jim. We are trying to get the procedures finished and up to you as quickly as we can. They exist. What's going on now is the guys are running them in the CMS/LMS, integrated, to make darn sure that the attitudes are correct and the time line is nice and relaxed and all that good stuff. And they won't be finished that run for another few hours. However, we expect to have an overall time line and a sequence of events for you before that time, and we'll start with the procedures as soon as they get ready. Over.
118:45:50|T|CDR|Okay. That's good. I think that perhaps we ought to go back to the original procedures we have on board and modify them as we have the time to.
118:46:10|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. Roger. We're going to do that to the maximum extent possible. And it looks reasonably feasible. To begin with in the command module we're going to have to send you some separate sequences for powering it up a little bit at a time. The closer we get to entry the more we get on the checklist. By the time we're about at EI minus 45 we're on the checklist all the way.
118:46:39|T|CDR|Okay.
118:46:49|T|CDR|And just as a reminder, don't forget our stowage problem. We - We still have to do quite a bit of stowage of the drogue and probe in the LM, and, et cetera.
118:46:59|C|Kerwin|Roger that. We've got a team working on that, and incidentally, one of the information items that they want to know is which lithium hydroxide containers in the command module are empty. They just want to know that for weight and balance - and there's no rush about it  -
118:47:18|T|CDR|...
118:56:43|T|CDR|Aquarius, Houston.
118:56:46|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, Aquarius.
118:56:50|T|CDR|Another note of interest to the crew systems people - Tell them that they don't have to bother putting the refrigerator onboard. I just brought out some hot dogs, and they're practically frozen.
118:57:05|C|Kerwin|(Laughter) Okay. We copy that, Jim.
119:11:05|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
119:11:10|T|CDR|Go ahead.
119:11:11|C|Kerwin|Okay. We'd like another volt, amp reading, Jim.
119:11:16|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by, Joe.
119:11:18|C|Kerwin|Roger.
119:12:40|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
119:12:41|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, Jim.
119:12:44|T|CDR|Volt 39.4, amp 1.26.
119:12:49|C|Kerwin|Okay. Roger that. And, Jim, we ought to have a - an entry time line to discuss with you in one hour.
119:12:49|P|PAO|"This is Apollo Control 119 hours 17 minutes ground elapsed time. Spacecraft position 112,224 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity continuing to build up. Now 5,478 feet per second. Looking now at entry interface time of 142 hours 40 minutes 42 seconds which according to the count down clock is some 23 hours 22 minutes from now. Got a midcourse correction burn something less than 2 feet per second which may or may not be done some 18 hours 22 minutes from now which is entry minus 5 hours. Cabin pressure aboard Aquarius holding around 4.7 pounds. Communication still rather scratchy, from time to time spacecraft Communicator Joe Kerwin requests the crew to give amp pressure and voltage readouts on the battery charge going on and has been underway since about 112 hours. At 119 hours 19 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control."

119:59:38|C|Kerwin|Guess what.
119:59:42|T|CDR|What?
119:59:43|C|Kerwin|Your volts and amps time, Jim.
119:59:48|T|CDR|That goes like the Amos and Andy show.

120:01:01|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. What? Over.
120:01:06|T|CDR|39.4, 1.26.
120:01:12|C|Kerwin|Are you really going up there, and looking at them?
120:01:17|T|CDR|That's what the meters say.
120:01:18|C|Kerwin|Okay. We copy, Jim.
120:17:26|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
120:17:30|T|CDR|Go ahead.
120:17:32|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We show the SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF valve is back in the AUTO position, and we'd like to have it off for good scrubbing. Over.
120:17:50|T|CDR|Have you seen it CLOSED down there?
120:17:58|C|Kerwin|Okay. Thank you, Jim.
120:18:02|T|CDR|The corner of our - of our  ... of the scrubbers ...
120:18:08|C|Kerwin|Roger. No sweat. Jim, in a few minutes I'm going to be coming at you with the - with the overall time line for tomorrow morning. You might want to think about taking a few notes, although we don't have detailed procedures for you at this time. Maybe you want to have Fred or Jack listen. Over.
120:18:33|T|CDR|Right. We're all set to copy.
120:18:35|C|Kerwin|Okay.

120:21:00|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
120:21:03|T|CDR|Go ahead.
120:21:05|C|Kerwin|For our benefit while we do this briefing, Jim, we'd like to have the, the COMM better, and we can sure spare the power; so we'd like you on panel 16 to close the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker, and on panel 12 we'd like you to move the VOICE FUNCTION switch to VOICE. Over.
120:22:22|C|Kerwin|Okay, Aquarius; Houston. How do you read?
120:22:26|T|CDR|Reading you loud and clear.
120:22:27|C|Kerwin|Okay, and you're real good. It's a - It's a pleasure not to have all that noise. Let me tell you what I want to do, Jim. As I said, we're not going to give you detailed procedures, now. What we expect to have for you shortly are procedures which we'll try and get up to you in the following form. First, we'll have a timeline, sort of a flight plan thing, which will have the times of all the major events and any configurations, switch settings, and so forth which are peculiar to our configuration and which, therefore, you won't find in the checklist. This, for instance, will be true of the way we power up the command module; and second, of course, we'll have any redlines to the checklist so that you can enter the checklist where possible to - to perform functions, and the timeline will simply refer you to the checklist when that's appropriate. Okay?
120:23:32|T|CDR|Okay. Sounds good. You're going to give me an overall time line now, I take it; is that right?
120:23:36|C|Kerwin|That's affirm. I'm going to first of all just quickly run through the times of the major events, and then we'll go back and fill in some of the details. Okay. Entry interface is at 142 hours 40 minutes; 6-1/2 hours, roughly prior to that or at about 136:10, we'll start this whole thing going by applying IMU HEATER POWER, by checking the CM/RCS temperatures and preheating the CM/RCS if required, and we suspect we'll probably want to do that. We'll have detailed procedures up for it later. At about 6 hours prior to EI or about 136:40, we will commence powering up the LM, powering up the AGS, using the modified LM/DPS RCS 30-minute checklist, which you have used for the previous midcourse. Then shortly, just before 5 hours, prior to EI or at about 137:40, we'll want you in the attitude for a LM AGS body axis alignment, using the Earth terminator like we did before; and as soon as we have that, we'll perform MCC-7, which looks like, now, about a 2-foot-per-second burn or about 15 seconds of RCS. And I'm told that it's down to 1-1/2 now, so it's comfortably within the RCS margin. Okay. When we do that, we'll immediately start the maneuver to the service module jettison attitude, which will be in plane since we're jettisoning it earlier than we usually do. We don't need, and don't want, the out-of plane component. So it'll be in plane with the service module pointed back out along the radius vector. We will then commence to get the command module ready for service module SEP, including command module RCS checkout and hot fire, and at approximately 4 hours and 30 minutes prior to EI or 138:10, we'll jettison the service module. We'll pitch the LM up until we acquire the service module in the ... and try and get some photographs, but we're not going to fool around with LM translation maneuvers for pictures because we don't want to screw up - foul up your flight path angle at that time. Okay. That gives us 2 hours to - of more or less open time here to finish up, if we're late on that, to go on over to checklist and prepare for powering up the command module. We're going to start the command module full powerup at EI minus 2 hours and 30 minutes or 140:10 GET. We'll get the computer on the line, we'll get the IMU up, we'll start uplinking your state vectors, and so forth, and aligning the command module platform. At about 1 hour and 30 minutes at the latest, giving us an hour to do this command module stuff, we will start the maneuver to the LM jettison attitude. You'll then start to close out the LM. Of course, we going to have our stowage all configured way before this. We'll close the hatch, do a pressure integrity check, and at EI minus 1 hour, or 141 hoars and 40 minutes, we'll jettison the LM. As soon as we do that, you can start the maneuver to the entry attitude. When you're there, do a sextant star check, take down the optics, and at that point we'll be giving you your final entry PAD. You can initialize the EMS, and you'll essentially be right back on the checklist at that point. There's one - one little difference from your nominal entry. You're a little bit earlier in the morning, so it going - it's going to be nighttime when you get to EI. However, we're fortunate enough to have the Moon in a perfect position for a horizon check. We'll give you a Moon check instead of a horizon check, and you can track it right down to moonset, which is going to be at EI roughly minus 3 minutes. And that's it for the quick time line. Do you have any questions right now?
120:28:11|T|CDR|I don't believe so, Joe, right now. We'll have to look at those time lines, and think about it for a little bit.
120:28:18|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real fine. We're ready to talk in some more detail about the alignment procedures, the CM powerup procedures, and so forth, but why don't we give you a few minutes to digest what you've already heard.
120:29:44|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
120:29:47|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, Aquarius.
120:29:50|T|CDR|Two question so far on heating up the CM/RCS. We assume that's LM power, and we assume that we're goin to have to power up both CM buses, right?
120:30:00|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. I didn't want to talk about that because we're not quite ready to recommend a procedure. We can't power up the CM/RCS per the normal checklist on the LM power because we haven't got quite enough amps. It may be that we'll want you to heat - to do the preheat one ring at a time and we're looking at that. Another possibility' is that we may want to take down LM power at that, time, do the preheat, and then go back to LM power until we have to take it down finally. Over.
120:30:38|T|CDR|Okay. Understand. Second question: when we finish MCC-7, that maneuver to SM JETT attitude will be angles given to us, by you, using the AGS align ball, right?
120:30:52|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative. Once we get that AGS aligned and get a time hack on it, the good people down here will be able to give us AGS - AGS, 8-ball attitudes for the service module separation attitude, for the command module alignment attitude, which we are going to pass you up the - a Moon/Sun P52-type aligment. We'll have AGS 8-ball attitudes for those, and we'll be able to uplink through the command module once we get the computer up a preferred REFSMMAT, which will be identical to the LM attitude at the time of the burn. And we'll go into details on that later.
120:31:43|T|CDR|Okay. Just stand by 1. I'll ...
120:31:48|C|Kerwin|Will do.
120:32:49|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
120:32:51|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, Jim.
120:32:54|T|CDR|We would like to have somebody look in to the control characteristics are of the LM/command module, and whether we can use the attitude control - control only to maneuver the combination to photograph the Service Module at 4 plus 30.
120:33:12|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good thinking. We are - it's - There has been a lot of consideration of what kind of maneuvers to let you do to photograph the LM, I mean the service module. We consider it quite low priority; the feeling is that it will be real nice to get pictures of the service module, but they are not required for our troubleshooting program. As far as the - the attitude control authority, and so forth, we will get you more detailed word on that later; we are working it. It appears that using the ACA instead of the TTCA after service module JETT will give you excellent attitude control authority, and that's what we recommend.
120:34:02|T|CDR|Okay. And I'm ... - also use an AGS ATT HOLD configuration to keep the attitudes - turn the LM JETT attitudes.
120:34:14|C|Kerwin|That's affirm. We are - We are probably going to recommend a tight deadband AGS attitude hold for that.
120:34:22|T|CDR|Okay.
120:34:45|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
120:34:47|C|Kerwin|Go ahead.
120:34:49|T|CDR|Okay. The star check at the entry attitude, is it a sextant star check or a COAS star check?
120:34:59|C|Kerwin|It'll probably be a sexant star check, Jim. It really depends on how good that platform is that we get. And we expect it to be plenty good enough for a sextant star check.
120:35:14|T|CDR|Okay.
120:35:15|C|Kerwin|While we are on that subject, Jim, I want to mention one thing to Jack. As I said, this CSM alignment procedure we are going to recommend is a Moon/Sun, and there are Sun filters stowed; they are stowed in compartment R-1; however, they are for the telescope only, of course, not the sextant. One is for the long eye-relief piece, the other for the normal eyepiece. And if he has any questions about that, we'll be glad to talk about it.
120:35:53|T|CDR|Okay.
120:36:07|T|CDR|And because it will be too late to do much about a hatch integrity check if it fails, you want us to have our suits on sometime during this period?
120:36:20|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We are laying for you on that one; it is a subject that we wanted to - to bring up with you. We have been considering it, and our feelings are - Of course, it is up to you, but as we see the pros and cons, you just put your finger on the pro. We do a hatch integrity check shortly before EI minus 1 hours, and if we bust it, you would have a hard time scrambling into the suits. On the other hand, the disadvantages of wearing the suits are that they might slow you down considerably, not even counting the time to don them, and someone is even very concerned that after such and such a period of time in the suits, you might get warm, and we might have to power up the SUIT LOOP to ventilate the suits and we don't particularly want to do that because it cost quite a bit of power. Consequently, our recommendation was going to be that you not wear the suit, since we have no reason to believe that the integrity check will show us anything but a slightly increased leak rate, and we can certainly hack that. What do you think? Over.
120:37:38|T|CDR|Well, I have confidence in the hatch, as long as it goes in and locks in smoothly; I see no reason why we need the suits, and one thing we are going to do during our spare time is to practice putting that hatch on, make sure we get it on and locked.
120:37:55|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real good. And with that precaution, think we can concur on that decision.
120:38:11|T|CDR|And that's all the questions we had about the time line you gave us.
120:38:14|C|Kerwin|Okay. Let me take a check here and see if there is anything anybody else wants to input to you, right now.
120:38:54|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
120:38:58|T|CDR|Go ahead.
120:38:59|C|Kerwin|Roger. One detail that I thought you ought to know about the service module JETT is that we're going to recommend a push-pull maneuver, that is in the attitude I described. We'll want you to go half a foot per second plus-X on the LM, then jettison the service module, then go half a foot per second minus-X, which will be less time because you're suddenly a heck of a lot lighter. Over.
120:39:33|T|CDR|Okay. Understand. You want me to go a half a foot per second plus-X, JETT the service module, and go a half a foot per second minus-X.
120:39:45|C|Kerwin|That's affirm. We think that will give you plenty of separation, and also will be a slow enough rate so you'll have a chance to get some photos.
120:41:06|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
120:41:08|T|CDR|Go ahead.
120:41:10|C|Kerwin|Okay. One more thing we want to update you on with a little detail. As we told you, the SM SEP attitude was in plane and the LM JETT attitude will be more similar to a normal service module SEP attitude, that is it will be LM up, out the radius vector and 45 degrees right, out of plane toward the south. We are going to recommend that prior to JETT, the configuration be with the LM overhead hatch closed, with the vent valve open, and we'll JETT with the tunnel pressurized. Over.
120:42:10|T|CDR|Okay, Joe. Understand that the LM JETT attitude will be similar to service module normal jettison, which will be up and out of plane, and as soon as I finish maneuvering to left JETT attitude, I'll scramble up and close the LM hatch, making sure the vent valve is open, and then we'll vent it - or jettison it with the tunnel pressurized.
120:42:36|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative. And Deke says don't forget to close the command module hatch on your way in.
120:42:45|T|CDR|I'm only scared that Jack will have it closed before I get up there.
120:42:49|C|Kerwin|(Laughter)
120:43:08|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. I think that's about all we have for you right now. Whenever you feel like you don't have any more questions at the moment, we'd like you to reconfigure for down voice backup and we'd like you to do that to move the VOICE FUNCTION switch to DOWNVOICE BACKUP as usual, but instead of pulling the circuit breaker, we'd like you to throw the POWER AMP switch to OFF, this time. Over.
120:44:00|T|CDR|Okay, Joe. I have one more question, here. If we get a little bit ahead of time on the command module full powerup after we jettison the service module, I'd like to go to LM JETT attitude early, and make sure we get that part squared away and sit there for a while before LM JETT of 1 hour. Now, will we be using LM power up to that time? There's two cables which we'll probably have to disconnect on the way up through the tunnel if we're still going to use LM power?
120:44:30|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative. Let me get word on when we expect to go off LM power.
120:44:54|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
120:44:58|T|CDR|Go ahead.
120:44:59|C|Kerwin|Roger. We expect to go off LM power at the time we start powering up the CSM or about minus 2-1/2 hours. That is not a hard number, and we'll be updating you on it. As far as going to the LM JETT attitude, that's completely permissible as soon as you have a powered up command module and a satisfactory platform, you can go there immediately. We're giving you a maximum of 1 hour just for grins. Over.
120:45:34|T|CDR|Okay. Fine. And that will be a LM maneuver, I assume, because we lost the service module, so no strain there.
120:45:42|C|Kerwin|Affirm.
120:45:49|T|CDR|And, Jack, would like to know what entry angle the mdcourse-7 will give us?
120:45:58|C|Kerwin|Oh, it'll put us right in the middle of the corridor, Jim.
120:46:04|T|CDR|Okay.
120:46:05|C|Kerwin|6.50 degrees. And, Jim, Houston. I guess, as a last item we expect that it will take us about an hour to update your checklist and your time lines sometime later on today, and we'd just like you to consider that. I expect it'll be 3 or 4 hours before we have all that stuff ready.
120:46:32|T|CDR|Okay. We'll be standing by for that, and now POWER AMPLIFIER switch is going to go off, and then we'll be going to DOWN VOICE BACKUP.
120:46:39|C|Kerwin|Okay.
120:46:39|P|PAO|"This is Apollo Control at 120 hours 47 minutes. Flight Director, Glynn Lunney, of the Black Team is on his way to the MSC Auditorium for a change of shift news conference. Glynn Lunney is on his way to the MSC Auditorium for a news conference."

120:57:28|C|Brand|Roger, Jim. We're receiving you now. Go ahead.
120:57:34|T|CDR|Okay. I thought you were calling, but I guess we had a ground switching problem down there.
120:57:40|C|Brand|Yes. We lost the lock for a little while there, Jim. Well, good day. Could you give us battery A voltage ... reading, please, and battery charger current, as you have been doing.
120:57:54|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. Stand by.
120:57:56|C|Brand|Okay.
120:59:11|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
120:59:13|C|Brand|Go ahead, Jim.
120:59:16|T|CDR|Okay. Volts are 39.5; amps, 1.25.
120:59:23|C|Brand|Roger. Copy 39.5 and 1.25. Thank you.
120:59:23|P|PAO|"This is Apollo Control, the Neil Armstrong News Conference will begin momentarily in the MSC auditorium."
121:47:31|C|Brand|Aqurius, Houston. Over.
121:47:37|T|CDR|Aquarius, here. Go ahead Houston.
121:47:40|C|Brand|Say, Jim, could you give us another reading on the Battery A voltage and bat charger current on the CSM please.
121:47:49|T|CDR|Bat amps coming up.
121:47:51|C|Brand|Okay. And sometime when you have some time to copy I have an entry stowage list to give you which specifies which equipment will be moved between vehicles before splash down.
121:48:13|T|CDR|Okay. I'll be able to copy that.
121:49:21|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
121:49:23|C|Brand|Go ahead, Aquarius.
121:49:25|T|CDR|Volts, 39.4; amps, 1.25.
121:49:30|C|Brand|39.4, and say again amps.
121:49:36|T|CDR|1.25.
121:49:38|C|Brand|Roger. Copy. Thank you.
121:50:49|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. We're ready to cover - to copy the stowage list.
121:50:55|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. Now, I'll give it to you in two parts. The first is LM to command module equipment transfer. The second part will be the reverse, command module to LM equipment transfer. And both parts represent Deltas from the launch stowage, and here comes the first list, LM to command module equipment transfer. First, DSEA, and I'll give you the stowage location, too. That goes in R-13.
121:51:42|T|CDR|Vance, what was that again?
121:51:46|C|Brand|DSEA; that's recorder in - will go in the command module; it's recommended you stow it in R-13. Over.
121:52:02|T|CDR|Okay, the DSEA - that's the recorder - will be stowed in R-13.
121:52:07|C|Brand|That's affirm. Next. LM flight data file. That will go in R-1, R-2, and R-3. Next. Three PPKs in A-8.
121:52:43|T|CDR|Okay.
121:52:44|C|Brand|Okay. 16-millimeter and 70-millimeter exposed film in R-13. Okay, next. O2 hose screen caps on the O2 hoses. Next: two 70-millimeter Hasselblad cameras, and stow these in B-6 in the empty LiOH volume.
121:53:45|C|Brand|Okay, next. Black-and-white TV camera, and recommend stow that on top of A-7 and A-11 in decontamination bag. Next: flag kit, stowage location A-8. Next: LM fecal bags, used, R-9, waste management system chute.
121:54:51|C|Brand|Okay, that's the first list, Jim.
121:54:58|T|CDR|Okay.
121:55:10|C|Brand|And, if you want to read that one back, why then I'll - I'll give you the second one.
121:55:22|T|CDR|This is the LM to command module transfer, and this is the Delta from the launch stowage. Number 1: DSEA ...; number 2: LM flight data file in R-1, R-2, R-3; three PPKs in A-8 ...
121:56:15|T|CDR|... A-8; and used LM fecal bags in R-9.
121:56:23|C|Brand|Okay, that's affirm, Jim. We had a lot of noise, and we didn't get the middle part, but I think that's fairly - should be fairly clear to you, and don't bother with the readback of that that we missed, unless you have any doubts. And then I'll, if you're ready to copy, I'll give you the second list.
121:56:47|T|CDR|Okay.
121:56:49|C|Brand|Okay. This is CM to LM equipment transfer. Cabin fan filter and bag, and that, in the LM, should go in the ISA. Okay, next: decontamination bags, except for the ones used to wrap camera, should go in the ISA.
121:57:33|C|Brand|Okay. Two LCGs, if you don't have them on already, to the IS - ISA. I realize you wouldn't have them on, because you're cold enough already.
121:57:57|T|CDR|That's right.
121:57:59|C|Brand|Okay, and finally, four LiOH cans, the ones used in the LM, and those can go in the jettison bag in the LM. Okay, a couple of notes. After loading the ISA, recommend secure it to the righthand restraint system.
121:58:40|C|Brand|And secure the jettison bag to the PLSS on the floor. And that's all.
121:59:07|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. This is command module to LM: cabin fan filter and bag in the ISA; decontamination bags, except for the ones we use for the TV camera, in the ISA; two LCGs in the ISA; four LiOH [sic] cans in the JETT bag; and we'll secure the ISA on the right-hand side - on the right-hand restraint system, and we'll secure the JETT bags to the PLSS on the floor.
121:59:36|C|Brand|Roger. That's it.
122:13:01|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
122:13:42|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
122:13:48|T|CDR|Go ahead.
122:13:49|C|Brand|Jim, would you give us PCM to HI bit rate. We think maybe we might be able to lock up on your high bit rate now. Over.
122:15:11|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
122:15:16|T|CDR|Go ahead.
122:15:17|C|Brand|Okay, Jim. We're getting it intermittently. We think we might get it steady and improve circuit margins if you would, in addition, on panel 16, open the PRIMARY POWER AMPL circuit breaker, and I'll give you next step in a minute.
122:15:39|T|CDR|Okay. PRIMARY POWER AMPL is opened.
122:15:41|C|Brand|Okay. And on panel 12, POWER AMPL to PRIMARY.
122:15:50|T|CDR|POWER AMPL to PRIMARY.
122:15:52|C|Brand|Roger.
122:17:57|C|Brand|Aquarius, 13.
122:18:02|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
122:18:04|C|Brand|Or rather, Houston. Jim, it looks like we got a lockon, which is going to improve our data flow here. Only thing is, we'll probably lose data and probably voice, too, during a portion of each roll. So you might expect that. The other thing is, if anyone has on any BIOMED, would you switch your switch to - your BIOMED switch to that position.
122:18:37|T|CDR|Understand the first, Vance, and no one has on any BIOMED  -
122:18:44|C|Brand|Okay.
122:18:45|T|CDR|-  Fred and Jack are maneuvering things around right now, and mine is long since departed the scene.
122:18:51|C|Brand|Okay. Copy.
122:19:30|T|CDR|Vance, you might be interested - the way we're - the way we got this thing arranged, we have one helmet attached to the COMM lines attached to the LM hoses, and the guy that's got the duty wears the helmet, so the other people are free to maneuver.
122:19:48|C|Brand|Right. That's understandable. One guy's on the leash, huh?
122:19:58|T|CDR|Yes. ...
122:19:58|P|PAO|"This is Apollo Control at 122 hours, 24 minutes. We plan to take another telemetered look at the command module before too long. Readout the thermo parameters. Apollo 13 is 102,019 nautical miles from Earth; velocity 5,819 feet per second. Current load now is about 19 amps. Cabin pressure is 4.98 pounds per square inch. Temperature 52 degrees."
122:25:10|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
122:25:15|T|CDR|Go ahead.
122:25:17|C|Brand|Jim, when you get finished moving your stowage around and it's convenient, we'd like to terminate the battery charge for a little while to bring up the CM TM so we can take a look at the temperatures again, like we did yesterday. Advise that right now on your batteries, you have 111 amp-hours; and, eventually, we hope to have them up - peaked up to about 116. One other point, we - we can either read that procedure up again which involves cranking up the telemetry, or, if Jack still has it, we can use his notes and - but I have one or two changes to - to make on them. Over.
122:26:11|T|CDR|Okay, understand that you'll want us to terminate battery charge for a while, and crank up the CM TM to read out temperatures. And you have a few changes to Jack's checklist, and I'll turn the COMM over here to Jack shortly, as soon as he's finished, and we'll get along with it.
122:26:33|C|Brand|Okay, we'll be standing by for - there's no hurry on it.
122:38:10|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
122:38:15|C|Brand|Go ahead, Jim.
122:38:18|T|CDR|Just out of curiosity, Vance, what's our distance and velocity now?
122:38:24|C|Brand|Hey, stand by 1. You're speeding up, I think.
122:38:47|C|Brand|Jim, we have you 101,000 miles out, and your velocity is 5,848. Starting to speed up.
122:38:56|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you.
122:38:58|C|Brand|Sure enough.
122:41:59|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
122:42:03|C|Brand|Go ahead, Jack.
122:42:06|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. Jim said that you want to terminate battery charge on battery A.
122:42:13|C|Brand|That's affirm, Jack. Request to - Before you terminate it, get the usual readout on voltage and current; and we'd also like a time of termination, and understand you have the termination procedures. Is that affirm?
122:42:35|T|CMP|Okay. That's affirm. Stand by. Let me just make sure I've got everything here before I go off on a tangent.
122:42:43|C|Brand|Okay, Jack, and your battery-charge termination procedure remains unchanged, but when we go to power up the CM and look at your TM, we have a couple of additional steps.
122:43:23|T|CMP|Okay. Vance, I do have the procedure for stopping the battery charge. And do you want me to copy this procedure now, or do you want me to come back and give you the volt, amps, and time and - after I complete this termination?
122:43:47|C|Brand|Okay. Just - just give us the volts and amps just before you start the termination of the procedure, and understand you say you have the charge - the procedure for taking the charge off. Is that affirm?
122:44:09|T|CMP|That's affirm.
122:44:11|C|Brand|Okay. And just give us a hack on the time  -
122:44:13|T|CMP|And you want to - you want to review it at all?
122:44:19|C|Brand|Negative. Unless you want me to. I'll tell you what; I could run through it very quickly just to verify that we're getting started off on the correct path here.
122:44:31|T|CMP|Yes. Okay, the first four or five things that I have is panel BAT CHARGE to OFF on panel 3; AC INVERTER 2, OFF; panel 5: MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C ON; panel 250: CB BAT A POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, open; panel 275: INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, open; and then, the - just to go ahead and reverse the position of the switches and circuit breakers that I started out with, and these don't have to be in reverse order. Is that Charlie?
122:45:12|C|Brand|Roger, that's - that's Charlie. Have at it.
122:45:17|T|CMP|Okay, we'll get a volts and amps right now.
122:45:20|C|Brand|Okay.
122:46:12|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. The volts and amps: 39.4; amps, 1.25.
122:46:22|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. We copy that. Incidentally  -
122:46:27|T|CMP|Okay. We're going up to termin - Go ahead, Vance.
122:46:33|C|Brand|Never mind, Jack. I'll bring this up later when you've finished the procedure.
122:46:47|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going off the air; I'll put Freddo on. I'm going to stop the battery charge.
122:46:55|C|Brand|Okay.
122:47:30|T|LMP|Now, how do you read, Vance?
122:47:32|C|Brand|Hey, loud and clear, Fred. Understand you've been doing some spring housecleaning, moving stowage around up there.
122:47:40|T|LMP|Boy, you wouldn't believe this LM right now; it's nothing but bags from floor to ceiling.
122:47:46|C|Brand|Hey, that brings up a question. We were wondering where you guys plan to stow the probe and drogue? It occurred to us that one possibility was to stow it in the LM, down about where the LMP normally stands, underneath the IS - ISAer. Perhaps you have a better idea. Over.
122:48:12|T|LMP|Yes, I do, Vance. Yes, it would go in the LM, but I thought maybe we ought to stow it where the CDR stands. How's that?
122:48:22|C|Brand|Okay. I can tell that you're just getting - getting that one over because Jim just got off the loop.
122:48:33|T|LMP|Yes, he's sleeping. No, that's - that's actually where we normally had been stowing it for normal LM JETTs.
122:48:44|C|Brand|Okay, and - Hey, we just - we'll record that, and figure that you'll stow the probe and drogue over in the - where the CDR stands. We have a - a change to this - equipment transfer list that I just read up to Jim. Why don't you make a note of this one item? Forget about the LM  -
122:49:07|T|LMP|Stand by; stand by 1.
122:49:08|C|Brand|Okay.
122:49:14|T|LMP|I think Jack hauled off the piece of paper with that - all that on it. Why don't you hold it until Jack gets done securing the battery charge?
122:49:24|C|Brand|Okay.
122:49:39|C|Brand|And, Fred, request PCM on LO bit rate, now.
122:49:44|T|LMP|Okay. And there was one piece of flight data that we needed that we didn't bring along this time.
122:50:00|C|Brand|What was that?
122:50:04|T|LMP|That's a big book with a lot of just plain old blank pages in it.
122:50:10|C|Brand|Yes, when you - when you get off nominal, why you just need scratch paper, don't you?
122:50:17|T|LMP|Yes.
122:51:28|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. I got the stowage list now.
122:51:32|C|Brand|Okay, I gave you two lists  -
122:51:33|T|LMP|And Jack's got - and Jack said he's completed - the - secured the battery charge now.
122:51:44|C|Brand|Okay, and we're recording the time that that was complete. You have two lists there, one is LM to CM equipment transfer and the second list is the reverse. Request you scratch the last item on the first list, which is returning used bags to the CM.
122:52:11|T|LMP|Okay. We didn't have any of those, so that didn't pose any problem anyway.
122:52:20|C|Brand|Okay.
122:53:28|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
122:53:29|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. Aquarius is back on.
122:53:32|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. Understand you completed securing the battery charge. Now if you are ready to copy, Jack, I would like to give you the two changes that we have to the powerup for the TM procedure. Over.
122:53:55|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by 1.
122:53:56|C|Brand|Okay.
122:54:59|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. You say you have some changes in the procedures that I used before to get telemetry and to check out the CSM system?
122:55:07|C|Brand|Yes, that's correct, Jack; they're pretty simple. About halfway through the procedure, we have a step on panel 3, which is POWER AMPL, HIGH; we'd like to change that to POWER AMPL, LOW.
122:55:29|T|CMP|Okay. Copy. POWER AMPL, LOW.
122:55:33|C|Brand|And the next change, Jack, is panel 275. Scratch the step "CB MAIN B, BAT B, close - BAT BUS B, close."
122:55:50|T|CMP|Okay. You want to delete the step "CB MAIN B, BAT BUS B, close."
122:55:55|C|Brand|Roger. As you know, we're going to do this on LM power, so this reflects that.
122:56:04|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine.
122:56:07|C|Brand|Okay, and have at it. We - we'd like to have the TM up for about 5 or 10 minutes to look at the data from the CM; look at your temperatures, et cetera. And after that, we'll go back to charging the battery again, and the charge will probably go until around GET 126.
122:56:27|T|CMP|Okay. Do you want the same readouts from me that I gave you before?
122:56:34|C|Brand|That's affirmative, Jack. And just to make sure that there is no mistaking the procedure, it starts out for the backout part: panel 3, POWER AMPL, OFF; TRANSPONDER, OFF; AC INVERTER 2, OFF; then goes to panel 250, et cetera.
122:57:07|T|CMP|That's - that's the way I read it.
122:57:09|C|Brand|Okay.
122:57:13|T|CMP|Okay; going back up into the refrigerator.
122:57:17|C|Brand|Hey, I thought it was the bedroom.
122:57:22|T|CMP|Well, it's got a new name now, because it is about 30 degrees cooler.
122:57:30|C|Brand|Roger. Returning to the deep freeze  -
122:57:31|T|CMP|-  Hey, Vance. One thing that I wanted to ask you - is on the stowage list where you have us putting the black-and-white TV camera on top of A-7 in an A-8 ... decontamination bag, I was wondering if it would be possible or if you - there would be any problem in putting it into B-6 along with the two 70-millimeter Hasselblad cameras?
122:58:02|C|Brand|Jack, I don't think there'll be any problem, if you can get it in, but let us get - work that and get back with you. Okay?
122:58:10|T|CMP|All right. I was just thinking. I'm trying to get as much weight as possible down there in that LEB. We have no SRCs and then our waste tank is - you know - rather depleted. I think it's about down to 40 percent or so. So I'm trying to get as much L over D as I can, and any heavy items we can get down there, I'd be greatly appreciative of you bringing it to our attention.
122:58:39|C|Brand|Okay. We copy that, and we owe you an answer on your last question.
122:58:46|T|CMP|Okay. And I'm in work, going to give you some telemetry.
122:58:51|C|Brand|Okay.
122:58:51|P|PAO|"This is Apollo Control at 123 hours, 2 minutes. Apollo 13 is less than 100,000 miles from Earth now, 99,868 nautical miles. Velocity 5,897 feet per second."
123:06:21|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. We're receiving CSM data now.
123:06:27|T|LMP|Roger.
123:09:08|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
123:09:15|T|LMP|Say again, Vance.
123:09:17|C|Brand|Fred, we just lost data on Aquar - on Jack. Would you have him select best OMNI, please?
123:09:27|T|LMP|Okay.
123:09:27|P|PAO|"This is Apollo Control at 123 hours 9 minutes. We are using LM power for this Command and Service Module telemetry check. The current is up now to 24 amps."
123:11:34|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
123:11:39|T|LMP|Go ahead, Houston.
123:11:41|C|Brand|Fred, we have enough data; recommend that Jack take off the TM and power back down again, using his backout procedure. Just let us know when he does it.
123:11:56|T|LMP|Okay.
123:11:59|C|Brand|And, after that, we'll start the battery charge, and we'll have to know when he starts that.
123:12:07|T|LMP|Okay. He's starting to back out now. Just out of curiosity, what - did you all get a readout on what the cabin temp was up there?
123:12:20|C|Brand|Yes, we're getting 45 to 46 degrees.
123:12:31|T|LMP|Now you see why we call it the refrigerator.
123:12:35|C|Brand|Yes, it's kind of a cold winter day up there, isn't it? Is it snowing in the command module yet?
123:12:50|T|LMP|Is it what, Vance?
123:12:52|C|Brand|Is it snowing in there yet?
123:12:59|T|LMP|Oh, snowing. No - no, not quite. The windows are in pretty bad shape, and I guess the service module - we'll be trying to shoot out of the LM windows, because every window in the command module is just covered with water droplets. It's going to take a lot of scrubbing to get those cleared off.
123:13:21|C|Brand|Roger. Understand. Pete says to tell you that you'll have some time on the beach in Samoa to thaw out after this cold experience.
123:13:37|T|LMP|Hey, that sounds great.
123:14:01|T|LMP|Vance, have you all thought about what cameras you wanted to use? Right now, we've got configured a Hasselblad with a 250, and I've got the lunar-surface number 1 Hasselblad, and I've got the lunar surface sequence camera, also, rigged and ready to go. Did you have any other druthers about other options.
123:14:26|C|Brand|You are referring to the photography of the service module, is that right?
123:14:32|T|LMP|That's right.
123:14:33|C|Brand|We have some procedures in work, and I've seen them, Fred. I think pretty soon we'll be shooting them up to you to specify which cameras and settings. But that - that sounds pretty close.
123:14:50|T|LMP|Okay, you might let them know that, if they hadn't thought of it, that we got this lunar-surface sequence camera on board which has its own battery pack setup, and to shoot quite a few pictures with, and that could also be used for this.
123:15:04|C|Brand|Roger. I know we are planning to use that camera, among others.
123:15:11|T|LMP|Okay.
123:18:11|T|LMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. Jack has backed out of powering up the CM, and now he's proceeding to restart battery charge on BAT A.
123:18:25|C|Brand|Okay. Real good, Fred. We copy.
123:21:32|T|LMP|Okay. And we are charging battery A now.
123:21:37|C|Brand|Roger. Charging battery A, Fred.
123:22:03|C|Brand|And, Fred, request now first reading of voltage - BAT A voltage and charger current. Over.
123:22:17|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. I can give it to you. I read it right after I started it. BAT A voltage was 39.4 and the current had jumped up to 1.4.
123:22:32|C|Brand|Okay. 39.4 and 1.4. Thanks, Jack.
123:22:37|T|CMP|Okay. How about - You ready for some other readouts, that you wanted there?
123:22:40|C|Brand|Ready to copy.
123:22:44|T|CMP|Okay. BAT B, 37.0; pyro A, 37.0; pyro B, 37.0; SPS helium pressure, 3400; and nitrogen A and B - just for throwing it in for kicks, 2200 and 2400, respectively; and the injector temperatures - stand by - The Sun went down. Okay. The injector temperatures, 5 Charlie, 3.9; 5 Dog, 3.2; 6 Alfa, 3.6; 6 Baker, 3.9; 6 Charlie, 3.5; 6 Dog, 3.4; the battery manifold pressure, 1.4.
123:24:01|C|Brand|Okay. We copy all that, Jack. Thank you.
123:24:04|T|CMP|Okay.
123:24:20|T|CMP|You say, you figure you are going to be charging BAT A until about 126?
123:24:32|C|Brand|Roger. About 126:30 is an estimate, Jack.
123:24:40|T|CMP|Okay. You figure it will be fully charged then, huh?
123:24:43|C|Brand|Yes. That's right. We'll have all the batteries up to about 116 amps-hours.
123:24:55|T|CMP|That's good news.
123:24:58|C|Brand|That's better than 99, huh?
123:25:05|T|CMP|You're right.
123:25:38|T|CMP|How did all our systems look on telemetry, Vance?
123:25:44|C|Brand|I didn't hear any complaints, but just a minute; let me make a detailed check.
123:26:42|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
123:26:47|T|CMP|Go ahead.
123:26:48|C|Brand|Jack, it's a general statement. It looks like temperatures have cooled off in the ballpark of 6 to 8 degrees cooler than what they were yesterday. Looks like everything is still within tolerance, but we're working up a detailed sheet of temperatures to send up to you, for your interest.
123:27:16|T|CMP|Okay. That sounds good.
123:29:33|T|CMP|Houston, Aquarius.
123:29:42|C|Brand|Go ahead, Aquarius.
123:29:45|T|CMP|Vance, Joe brought up the alignment at EI minus 2 plus 30. Were you going to send up or have a discussion about that later on.
123:30:00|C|Brand|That's correct, Jack. We just about have procedures in hand detail checklist-type procedures to send to you. In other words, a time line with reference to entry checklist and any changes in the entry checklist. So, if you have a few pages of scratch paper, why, I think we'll have that to you within an hour.
123:30:26|T|CMP|Okay. I'll be standing by.
123:30:38|C|Brand|One other thing, Jack - You still with me?
123:30:44|T|CMP|Yes, go ahead.
123:30:45|C|Brand|The stowage people have tried out this black-and-white TV camera into B-6 idea and they say even with the lens off, they can't get it in. So, I still recommend that it be stowed where we had it on the list. That's A-7.
123:31:05|T|CMP|No problem.
123:32:16|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
123:32:21|T|CMP|All right, go ahead.
123:32:22|C|Brand|Jack, request another voltage readout on BAT A and current on BAT CHARGER
123:34:30|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. The volt 39.3, amp 1.3.
123:34:39|C|Brand|Roger. Copy 39.3 and 1.3.
123:38:57|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
123:39:02|T|CMP|Go ahead, Vance.
123:39:03|C|Brand|Jack, looks like the LM suit release valve has been bumped to AUTO again; request it  -
123:39:12|T|CMP|Okay.
123:39:13|C|Brand|-  closed. Over.
123:39:14|T|CMP|In work.
123:39:15|C|Brand|Okay.
123:39:27|T|CMP|How's that right there?
123:39:30|C|Brand|Okay. They say it looks good.
123:39:34|T|CMP|Okay.
123:43:43|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
123:43:49|T|CMP|Go ahead.
123:43:50|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. We need another one of those voltage amps readouts and then maybe we will get off of your back for a little while.
123:43:57|T|CMP|Oh, don't worry about it. I'd like to have you talk with us. Volts and amps coming up.
123:44:02|C|Brand|Okay.
123:45:29|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. Volts 39.4, amps 1.25.
123:45:38|C|Brand|Okay. EECOM's got it duly recorded.
123:45:45|T|CMP|Is John Aaron on?
123:45:53|C|Brand|No. Gee, I don't know what shift he is on. But he comes in later, I guess.
123:46:13|T|CMP|Actually, all the shifts are morning shifts to us.
123:46:19|C|Brand|Say that one again  -
123:46:20|T|CMP|The Sun is always shining - All of the shifts are morning shifts to us, because the Sun is always shining.
123:46:28|C|Brand|That was a short night.
123:46:39|T|CMP|Just for curiosity's sake, are we still holding entry angle at 6.25?
123:46:59|C|Brand|Okay. Jack, right now we're told that it's closer to 6, and - But they would like to track it some more. Looks like your next midcourse will be in the order of 2 to 3 foot per second.
123:47:16|T|CMP|Okay.
123:47:16|P|PAO|"This is Apollo Control at 123 hours 48 minutes. Apollo 13 is 97,232 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 5,996 feet per second. We are 18 hours 52 minutes away from entry at 400,000 feet. And if the crew is satisfied with the integrity of the Command Module tunnel hatch, they will make this reentry unsuited."
123:54:03|T|CMP|I just got a good view of the Southern Cross, Alpha and Beta Centauri, and Atria.
123:56:40|T|CMP|Houston, 13.
123:56:45|C|Brand|Go ahead, Jack.
123:56:49|T|CMP|Okay. We're still in good shape as far as water goes in the LM?
123:56:56|C|Brand|Okay. We copy.
123:57:11|T|CMP|The reason I ask is I'm assuming that we are, and I have no idea each time I pressurise the surge tank to get water out of the command module, how much I drop that surge tank and if we are in good shape as far as water goes in the LM, we'd like to fill a couple of drink bags to get some water for drinking purposes.
123:57:37|C|Brand|Okay. Have you run out of CM drinking water yet, Jack?
123:57:43|T|CMP|Oh, no, we've got plenty of drinking water. I think the - I don't have any idea what the surge tank pressure is.
123:57:57|C|Brand|Okay. It's 750  -
123:57:58|T|CMP|-  and I don't have any  -
123:57:59|C|Brand|It's 750, Jack.
123:58:02|T|CMP|Okay. 750.
123:58:33|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
123:58:38|T|CMP|Go ahead, Vance.
123:58:40|C|Brand|Okay. Stand by 1, Jack, and we'll give you an indication of how that water situation on the LM is - which is your question. Right?
123:58:51|T|CMP|Okay. But I guess what I was really asking is, if you'd have any violent objections if we filled two drink bags from LM water rather than repressurizing the surge tank.
123:59:03|C|Brand|Okay. Stand by on that.
123:59:04|T|CMP|Also, Jim - also, Jim is asleep up there and we didn't want to bother him, either.
123:59:10|C|Brand|Okay. We understand.
123:59:18|C|Brand|And, Jack, we'll be changing stations in 1 minute; so, we may have a temporary dropout in COMM.
123:59:26|T|CMP|Okay.
124:02:09|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
124:02:18|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. Go ahead. Loud and clear.
124:02:20|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. We're going to bargain with you on this one. Instead of two, would - wish that you would just get just one bag full. That shouldn't do any harm; however  -
124:02:32|T|CMP|Okay.
124:02:33|C|Brand|-  we are not all that fat on water that we want to do any drinking out of the LM as a regular thing after this one bag. So would you let us know when you get the water out and give us a mark on it so we can watch the TM. Over.
124:02:53|T|CMP|Okay. Fredo is about to withdraw the water now.
124:06:01|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. We've withdrawn - oh, about 8 ounces of water.
124:06:09|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. How's it taste?
124:06:18|T|CMP|It's - good. It's not quite as gaseous as that in the command module.
124:06:18|P|PAO|"This is Apollo Control at 124 hours 15 minutes. Apollo 13 now 95,638 nautical miles from Earth; velocity 6,057 feet per second. The temperature in the LM cabin now reading 51 degrees, pressure 4.98 pounds per square inch; carbon dioxide partial pressure 2/10ths of a millimeter of mercury."
124:17:16|C|Brand|Apollo 13, Houston - or rather, Aquarius, Houston. Over.
124:17:23|T|CMP|Go ahead.
124:17:25|C|Brand|Hey, Jack, we need another reading. Volts and amps.
124:17:29|T|CMP|Okay. They're coming up.
124:20:10|T|CMP|Vance, you won't believe this, but Freddo says it's 39.4 and 1.245.
124:20:19|C|Brand|Okay. Our EECOM is recording those numbers. Charlie Dumas, this time.
124:20:27|T|CMP|Oh.
124:20:36|C|Brand|Not changing very fast, is it?
124:20:42|T|CMP|How far out are we?
124:20:55|C|Brand|Okay. 95 3 and 6068 on velocity, per FIDO.
124:21:02|T|CMP|Okay.
124:21:03|C|Brand|Bill Stoval.
124:21:04|T|CMP|Thank you.
124:38:32|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. Over
124:38:38|C|Brand|Go ahead, Aquarius.
124:38:42|T|CDR|Are the flowers in bloom in Houston?
124:38:45|C|Brand|No, not yet. Still must be winter.
124:38:52|T|CDR|Suspicions confirmed.
124:38:57|C|Brand|Yes, I doubt if they will be blooming even Saturday, when you return.
124:39:05|T|CDR|I concur.
124:39:07|C|Brand|Hey, Jim, we have some photo information to pass up to you. Discussed this briefly with Fred earlier. It's instructions or suggestions for which photos - which cameras and lenses to use during your service module photography. Over.
124:39:31|T|CDR|Understand. Stand by 1.
124:39:33|C|Brand|Okay.
124:39:57|T|CDR|Go ahead.
124:39:59|C|Brand|Okay. We have three cameras here, two of them to be used for picture taking from the LM, one to be used from the number 5 window of the CSM. First, I'll hit the LM cameras. And this camera that I mention now has first priority. It's considered the one to give you the best results. That's the 70-millimeter DC Reseau camera, Hasselblad, that is, with the 80-millimeter lens, from box A-13. Suggest fresh magazine of 3400 black-and-white film.
124:41:02|T|CDR|Okay.
124:41:06|C|Brand|Okay. Suggest either magazine R or magazine S from A-13. Transfer all of this to the LM and recommend the following settings: LM/DC/80/BW 3400 (f:5.6 at a 250th).
124:42:00|C|Brand|And that's all for that one.
124:42:04|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. Let me see if I have it here. For the LM, want to use the 70-millimeter DC Hasselblad 80-millimeter lens in A-13, using 3400 black-and-white film MAGs R or S. Prepare to take camera to the LM, and the setting would be the LM/DC/80/BW 3400 f:5.6 at a 250th.
124:42:28|C|Brand|That's correct. Okay. Next: the next camera - Stand by 1. I've got noise here. Okay. The next LM - The next camera for the LM will be the 16-millimeter, and these photos are considered to be priority 3. Okay. One, get the 16-millimeter DAC and powerpack from A-8. Get the 10-millimeter lens, and remove it - remove the 10-millimeter lens, and take the 18-millimeter lens from B-3 and attach it to the camera. And attach the power cable transfer to the LM, set frame rate at 12 frames per second, and the same data line that I gave you before reads this way this time. LM/DAC/18/CEX, battery (f:8 and 1/250th). Okay. Now looking at these two cameras in the LM, it's recommended that you use the 16-millimeter for the first 2-1/2 minutes and then switch to the 70-millimeter. That's partly because the frame's been - or the - They've been optimized for closer and longer range. Okay. Read back, please.
124:44:59|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. Essentially, what you wanted to use as far as the movie camera in the LM goes, is our lunar sequence camera which is attached to the powerpack. We use the 18-millimeter lens, set it at 12 frames per second, CEX film, f:8 at 250th of a second.
124:45:22|C|Brand|Roger. f:8 at 250th.
124:45:30|T|CDR|Right; f:8 at 250th.
124:45:35|C|Brand|Okay. Would you believe that we have a correction now to the last camera I gave you? Correct that 18-millimeter lens to 75-millimeter lens.
124:45:52|T|CDR|Okay. The 18-millimeter to the 75-millimeter lens. Okay.
124:45:57|C|Brand|Right. Okay. Next for the command module pictures, it may be a little hard to see the service module from the command module, but if you can see it, it will be through window 5, people down here think. Recommend for that the CM 70-millimeter. These photos have priority 2. So this is 70-millimeter EL, with - which has the 80-millimeter attached, and this is all in B-3. Take off the 80-millimeter lens and attach the 250-millimeter lens. And the 250-millimeter lens can be found in U-4. Use CEX film from A-13. Ring sight from A-7, and these pictures will be f:8 at a 250th. And I think probably by now you probably all have - already have these cameras configured, and this may be redundant information, but here it is anyway. Over.
124:47:26|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. You're right. We do have cameras almost configured like you said. For the command module, you think that the EL with the 250 lens, CEX film, f:8 at one 250th is the best bet, and you're saying now that where you think you'll see it is out window 5? Is that it?
124:47:48|C|Brand|That's right, Jim.
124:47:52|T|CDR|Okay. My procedure, now, after service module JETT is going to be to pitch up, in order to try to get the service module into the - to get the center window in view of the service module, which we are going to have somebody there - to photograph. Why do you think window 5 will be it?
124:48:35|C|Brand|Okay. Stand by on that one. This is a question of geometry, and I'll get right back.
124:48:35|P|PAO|"This is Apollo Control at 124 hours 55 minutes. Apollo 13 now 93,329 nautical miles from Earth, velocity 6,148 feet per second. We're 12 hours 45 minutes away from the planned last midcourse correction. Tracking to date indicates that would be about a 3.4 feet per second DELTA-V. If it stays around that number, it will probably be done with the reaction control system, it would be a 25 second duration burn with reaction control system. Capcom Vance Brand will pass up more information here shortly on the photography task as the Service Module separates and we will stand by for that."
124:58:10|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
124:58:14|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
124:58:16|C|Brand|Jim, regarding window 5, I have a drawing here; and, when you're docked, you have approximately a 60-degree angle between the Z-axes of the two spacecraft. It appears that peering out window 5, you would be looking at the rendezvous radar on top of the LM which would, if you pitched, more or less give you a view of the service module. That is, if you pitched, so - from - and I think that this has been run by quite a few folks here; so, offhand, I can't see where any other window would be as good or perhaps even possible.
124:59:12|T|CDR|Okay. I understand. Yes, you're right. When we look out window 5, we can see rendezvous radar, and we'll try - We'll try window 5.
124:59:21|C|Brand|Roger. It presumes, though, that there has to be a pitch to be able to see it. You guys sound a lot more rested today.
124:59:33|T|CDR|Well, I just went back and sacked out for an hour or so and didn't get back up.
124:59:40|C|Brand|Very good.
125:00:51|C|Brand|And, Jim, Houston. We really are going to get those checklists up to you.
125:00:57|T|CDR|Okay.
125:15:07|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
125:16:27|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
125:16:32|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
125:16:33|C|Brand|Jim, it's time for readings on the battery charging again. Request the BAT A voltage and the charger amps. Over.
125:16:43|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by, Vance.
125:19:07|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
125:19:09|C|Brand|Go ahead, Jim.
125:19:12|T|CDR|Okay. We have no more water in the potable tank. We tried to get some more out a few minutes ago, and there isn't any.
125:19:21|C|Brand|Okay. Understand you ran out of water in the CM potable tank.
125:19:27|T|CDR|Affirmative.
125:24:28|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 125 hours, 24 minutes. We have an update now on the lunar module consumables lifetime. These figures include powering up the LM at 136 hours, 15 minutes elapse time. Including that power up we have enough water for 30.7 more hours. The - enough oxygen for 140 -
125:25:17|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
125:25:38|P|PAO| - enough oxygen for 146 hours, and - 
125:25:50|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
125:25:54|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
125:25:56|C|Brand|Jim, we - you were able to get those voltage - BAT A voltage and current readings?
125:26:02|T|CDR|Oh, yes just a minute. Fred's - Fred's up there now.
125:26:05|C|Brand|Okay. And we're ready to read you the first checklist installment. This will - What we're going to readup is going to be a LM time line, a CSM time line, and checklist changes to conform with these. And right now I have the first installment of the CSM time line ready to read up. Over.
125:26:37|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. I'm going to get - Vance, I'm going to get Jack on the line for that; and so stand by.
125:26:43|C|Brand|Okay. And he'll need a lot of paper.
125:26:49|T|CDR|Okay. Volts are 39.5; amps, 1.24. Stand by.
125:27:01|C|Brand|Okay. We got it.
125:27:20|P|PAO|Time remaining on the electrical power at 22 and 1/2 hours, which would bring us to an elapsed time of 100 -
125:27:27|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
125:27:39|P|PAO|- would bring us to an elapsed time on the electrical power of 147 hours 30 minutes. The water remaining would bring us to elapsed time of 155 hours 42 minutes.
125:27:50|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. I'm on and ready to copy.
125:27:54|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. Wait 1. We want to get one into the hands of FLIGHT and EECOM, and it'll take about a minute or 2. Sorry to wake you up for this, but take about a minute, and then we'll read it up to you.
125:28:24|P|PAO|And we have about 137 hours worth of lithium hydroxide left. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the lunar module now, is at 3 tenths of a milimeter of mecury. The 146 hours of oxygen left in the lunar module would bring us to an elapsed time of 271 hours. We're at 17 hours 11 minutes away from entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Jim Lovell reported a short time ago, that the portable water tank in the command module has gone dry. There is enough of a pad in lunar module water, though that the crew would not have to go thirsty.
125:30:07|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
125:30:12|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. Go ahead.
125:30:14|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. Do you have any of that CM water - bagged water, left? Over.
125:30:22|T|CMP|Negative. I went up and tried to repressurize the surge tank and get another shot of water, and was able to repressurize the surge tank okay, but there was no water that came out of the water tank.
125:30:36|C|Brand|Yes. We understand that there isn't any more in the potable tank, but we understood that you had put some water from that tank into bags, and I wondered if any of the bags were left.
125:30:48|T|CMP|Negative.
125:30:50|C|Brand|Okay.
125:33:42|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. Ready to copy?
125:33:49|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. Ready to copy.
125:33:51|C|Brand|Okay. Start at EI minus 6-1/2 hours. You're going to re - get LM PADs and CSM PADs, and I don't know if you want to copy them or not. This is something I can just read off to you. Over. Without you copying unless you especially want it.
125:34:17|T|CMP|Okay.
125:34:19|C|Brand|Okay. LM pad, SM jettison  -
125:34:25|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead, read which ones we're going to get.
125:34:28|C|Brand|Okay. I'll read them fast first here so you get a general idea. LM PAD, service module JETT attitude, Moon viewing attitude, Sun viewing attitude, and LM JETT attitude. The CM PADs are coarse align angles for LM attitudes during Moon and Sun sightings, coarse align angles for entry REFSMMAT, and CMC angles on entry REFSMMAT for LM JETT. Moon viewing, and entry. Okay. That - That's general PAD information. If you want, I'll read it slowly so you can copy it all down; otherwise, I'll go ahead.
125:35:30|T|CMP|I got - I was trying to copy it as you were reading it, Vance. The LM PAD are service module jettison attitude, Moon viewing attitude, Sun viewing attitude, and LM jettison attitude. Is that correct?
125:35:44|C|Brand|That's correct. Okay. I'll read the CM PADs now, slowly. Coarse align angles for LM attitudes during Moon and Sun sightings.
125:36:21|C|Brand|Okay. The next coarse align angles for entry REFSMMAT. Okay. The next, CMC angles on entry REFSMMAT for (1) LM JETT, (2) Moon viewing, (3) entry. Okay. I'll stand by until you read that back.
125:37:37|T|CMP|Okay. The CSM pads will be coarse align angles for LM attitudes during Moon and Sun sightings. Coarse align angles for entry REFSMMAT. CMC - CMC angles on entry REFSMMAT for (1) LM Jettison, (2) Moon viewing, (3) entry.
125:38:07|C|Brand|Okay. That's correct.
125:38:43|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. Going to hold up 1. All the hordes of people that devised this procedure are going to be coming into the room in a minute, and they'd like to hold up until everybody can listen in.
125:39:24|C|Brand|Get that, Jack?
125:39:50|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. We're ready to go.
125:39:54|C|Brand|Okay. We lost you there briefly while you were in an attitude where we couldn't receive you. Jack, we'd like to hold off for about 5 minutes. We have some more people coming in to listen to this, and it took a lot of people to devise this procedure, and a few people have been testing it out, so we'd like to have them all on hand while we give you the rest.
125:40:21|T|CMP|Okay.
125:40:28|C|Slayton|How's the temperature up there, Jack? You guys chopping wood to keep warm?
125:40:34|T|CMP|Deke, it's about 51, I think, or 50 in the LM, and it's about - I don't know - 45 or little bit less in the command module.
125:40:49|C|Slayton|Oh, it's a nice fall day, huh?
125:40:54|T|CMP|Yes, I tell you, we don't have to worry about chilldown.
125:43:30|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. While we're waiting, do you have there also what I can expect ground to uplink me?
125:43:44|C|Brand|We'll have that, Jack, but - Stand by for that.
125:43:52|T|CMP|Okay.
125:44:08|C|Brand|Jack, probably - probably the thing to do is to give you all of the checklist, and it will include things like this. Then we'll have a big question and answer session afterwards, if that's okay by you.
125:44:24|T|CMP|Okay. That sounds good.
125:46:52|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. While we're waiting, just for your information, the command module has been stowed per your checklist with the exception of the two Hasselblad cameras.
125:47:10|C|Slayton|Roger. Got that, Jack.
125:47:22|T|CMP|And the LM is pretty well stowed with the exception when we have yet to bring in the probe and the drogue.
125:47:31|C|Slayton|Roger. Got that.
125:47:40|P|PAO|That's Deke Slayton talking to Jack Swigert.
125:47:55|C|Slayton|Relative to your water situation, Jack, we're going to have a pretty good hack on the LM here in the next few hours, and we anticipate letting you fill your own tanks before we transfer over, so you should be in reasonably good shape there.
125:48:12|T|CMP|Okay. We have a number of juice bags all cut and ready to go, and we tried to get the water out of the command module about 20 minutes ago and found out that the command module's potable tank was empty. So we have no bags made up now, so we're dependent on LM water, PLSS water.
125:48:39|C|Slayton|Roger. If you feel like trying the PLSS, that's all excess, and you might want to try that at any time. I'm sure it'll taste like PLSS but you might as well try it.
125:48:57|T|CMP|Okay.
125:50:28|T|CMP|Okay, Deke. All the windows in the command module are heavily coated with water right now. So I don't know what kind of pictures we'll get out of them, but I'm going to try and clean them off and do the best I can with the 250-millimeter lens on the Hasselblad.
125:50:47|C|Slayton|Roger. That's why we have the top priority stuff in the LM. We figure you've got a much better chance of getting it through there.
125:50:55|T|CMP|Okay.
125:53:24|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
125:53:29|T|CMP|Are you ready to send it up, Vance?
125:53:31|C|Brand|Jack, before we start reading the procedure, we'd like - We find that BAT A is topped off and in great shape. Like to switch over and top off BAT B some more. Give it 2 more hours of charging. Have about a seven- or eight-step procedure here to give you, if you want to copy that. We're switching before we start recording the entry procedures.
125:53:58|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by and let me get out my other checklist.
125:54:14|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. Ready to copy.
125:54:19|C|Brand|Okay. Panel 3: switch BATTERY CHARGE to OFF. Panel 5; MAIN BUS TIE BAT A/C to BAT A/C; CB BATTERY CHARGER, BAT A CHARGE to open; CB BATTERY CHARGER, BAT B CHARGE, close. Next, panel 250; CB BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING to close. Panel 5; MAIN BUS TIE, BAT B/C, off. Panel 3; BATTERY CHARGE to B. Advise; well, stand by. Jack, advise that we have a backout procedure for this, but we'll read that up to you later, in about 2 hours. And, also, that this procedure is a DELTA to your - the first battery charging procedure that we gave you. In other words, it's a DELTA from where you are right now.
125:57:10|T|CMP|Okay. This is the procedure for charging BAT Baker. Panel 3; BAT CHARGE, OFF; panel 5; MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C to A/C; CB BAT CHARGER, BAT A CHARGE, open; CB BAT CHARGER, BAT B CHARGE, close. Panel 250; CB BAT B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, close. Panel 5; MAIN BUS TIE, BAT B/C, to OFF; Panel 3; BAT CHARGE to B. This is a DELTA for the first battery charging procedure; you'll give me the backout procedure in a couple hours.
125:57:47|C|Brand|That's affirm.
125:57:51|T|CMP|Okay. I'll put it in work right now, then come back and stand by to copy the rest of - well, I - not the rest - everything.
125:58:01|C|Brand|Everything is right.
125:58:13|C|Brand|You'd never believe how much this procedure's been massaged in the last day.
126:00:17|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 126 hours. Apollo 13 is 89,401 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity is 6,310 feet per second. Jack Swigert's in the process of discontinuing the charge on battery A in the command module. And then they will hook up to BATT - the command module battery B and will charge that for about 2 hours top it off.
126:02:41|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. I put BAT Baker on charge; I don't think it quite had stabilized. It was reading 1.1 amps, 39.6 volts when I left up there.
126:03:02|C|Brand|Okay. We got that.
126:03:07|T|CMP|Okay. I guess now is as good a time to start as any.
126:03:21|C|Brand|Just a second, Jack.
126:04:45|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
126:04:50|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. You're kind of weak, but readable.
126:04:54|C|Brand|Jack, we're going to need readings on the BAT volt and charger amps about every 10 or 15 minutes for a while, so is there somebody else that can be reading them out while you're copying? Over.
126:05:10|T|CMP|Yes. Jim will take a run up there. Freddo is sleeping right now. We're trying to get some sleep here, and Jim'll run up and take a look at voltage and current whenever you call.
126:05:22|C|Brand|Okay.
126:06:34|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
126:06:37|C|Brand|Go ahead, Aquarius.
126:06:40|T|CDR|Vance, we've got to realize that we've got to establish a work-rest cycle up here, so we just can't wait around here to just read procedures all the time up to the burn. We've got to get them up here, look at them, and then we've got to get the people to sleep. So take that into consideration when you get ready to uh, to send up the PADs.
126:07:01|C|Brand|I know, Jim. We're very conscious of that. We - we should be ready to go in about 5 minutes. That's all I can say. Stand by.
126:07:16|T|CDR|Okay.
126:11:48|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
126:11:53|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. We're ready to go.
126:11:56|C|Brand|Okay. We need a - Sorry (laughter). We need a readout. Volts and amps.
126:12:05|T|CMP|Okay. In work.
126:12:10|C|Brand|And, might as well bring the COMM up to a higher fidelity for this long period of checklist reading. That requires, panel 16: CB PRIMARY S-BAND POWER AMP, closed.
126:12:37|T|CMP|Okay, PRIMARY S-BAND POWER AMP closed now. How do you read?
126:12:40|C|Brand|Okay. And next step, panel 12: S-BAND FUNCTION to VOICE and RANGING FUNCTION to RANGING.
126:13:25|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. The S-BAND FUNCTION is at VOICE and the RANGING switch was at RANGING.
126:13:32|C|Brand|Okay. That makes it so we can hear you better, Jack.
126:13:41|T|CMP|Okay. Can we - Since the first part of it, you're just going to read and I'm going to copy and we're going to have a question and answer period later, can we get started?
126:13:52|C|Brand|Okay. Procedure's coming back in again. Multicopies for distribution. And Ken's back. He's a local expert on this now, so we'll turn you over to him and he'll read it off.
126:14:07|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by. I'll give you volts and amps.
126:14:12|P|PAO|Ken Mattingly will read the procedures.
126:14:14|T|CMP|Okay. The voltage is 39.1; amps, 1.75.
126:14:20|C|Brand|Okay.
126:14:43|C|Mattingly|Hello, Aquarius; Houston. How do you read?
126:14:48|T|CMP|Okay. Very good, Ken.
126:14:50|C|Mattingly|Okay. Let me take it from the top here. Just - there might be some overlap, but to make sure we're all on the same signal. We're starting off with a set of time line procedures that are going to give us - end up with the normal entry checklist. There will be some checklist changes into the book, but the bulk of what I have for you is the time line stuff. And it starts at 6 hours and 30 minutes prior to EI and assumes that we're getting LM power to MAIN B in the command module. I think you already have the numbers for the LM PADs and the command module PADs; I mean the types of PADs we'll be giving you. And if you have a question on what they'll be doing or what they're for, I can go over those now or when we get through.
126:15:42|T|CMP|Okay. Yes, I'll make a little note there, and we'll discuss it when we get everything copied, huh?
126:15:50|C|Mattingly|All right. And the first item, then, after you get ready to start this checklist, is to install lithium hydroxide canisters and to stow ORDEAL. On panel 8, we want to turn the FLOODLIGHTS to FIXED.
126:16:08|T|CMP|Okay. Wait a minute. You're going too fast, here.
126:16:11|C|Mattingly|Okay. I'll tell you. I'll go line at a time and wait for your verification before I go on to the next one. I have panel 8, FLOODLIGHTS, FIXED.
126:16:38|T|CMP|Okay. Install LiOH canisters, stow ORDEAL, FLOODLIGHT, FIXED.
126:16:42|C|Mattingly|Okay. That's the panel 8 floodlights. Now we're going to take panel 5 and put the FLOODLIGHT rheostat to FLOOD and the LEB, that's panel 100, FLOODLIGHTS are also going to FIXED. And the purpose of this is to balance up buses A and B.
126:17:05|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 5; FLOODLIGHTS; you want the rheostat on. Panel 100, FLOODLIGHTS; you want FIXED.
126:17:14|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative. Okay. On panel 8: circuit breakers EMS, MAIN A and MAIN B, that's two, open.
126:17:47|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 8: EMS MAIN A and MAIN B, open.
126:17:51|C|Mattingly|Okay. On panel 250: circuit breaker BATTERY A POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.
126:18:14|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 250: CB BAT A POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.
126:18:20|C|Mattingly|Okay. The same for circuit breaker BATTERY B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING.
126:18:39|T|CMP|Okay. BATTERY B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.
126:18:42|C|Mattingly|Okay. And add BATTERY C POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING.
126:19:00|T|CMP|BATTERY C POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.
126:19:03|C|Mattingly|Okay. That's correct. On panel 5: circuit breaker BAT CHARGE, BATTERY A CHARGE, closed.
126:19:27|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 5: CB BAT CHARGE, BAT A, close.
126:19:32|C|Mattingly|Okay. And the same for circuit breaker for BATTERY CHARGE, BAT B/CHARGE, closed.
126:19:52|T|CMP|Okay, BAT CHARGER, BAT B/CHARGE, closed.
126:19:56|C|Mattingly|All right. Like to take MAIN BUS TIES, two of them, on and up. That's probably a verify.
126:20:16|T|CMP|MAIN BUS TIES A/C and B/C, on, verify.
126:20:21|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Circuit breaker BATTERY RELAY BUS, BATTERY A and B, closed.
126:20:43|T|CMP|Okay. CB BAT RELAY BUS, BAT A, and BAT RELAY BUS, BAT B, closed.
126:20:49|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative. Circuit breaker EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
126:21:13|T|CMP|EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
126:21:18|C|Mattingly|Okay. On panel 275: circuit breaker MAIN A, BATTERY C, closed.
126:21:37|T|CMP|Okay, Ken. Wait on that one here. I'm just about to lose you here. Just - I've got to change OMNIs.
126:21:42|C|Mattingly|Okay.</div>
126:21:47|T|CMP|Okay. Could you give me that one again, please.
126:21:50|C|Mattingly|All right. On panel 275: circuit breaker MAIN A, BATTERY C, closed.
126:22:05|T|CMP|Okay. MAIN A, BAT B, closed on 275.
126:22:09|C|Mattingly|That's MAIN A, BATTERY C, Charlie.
126:22:15|T|CMP|MAIN A, BAT C, Charlie.
126:22:20|C|Mattingly|That's affirm. No - Negative on battery Bravo.
126:22:27|T|CMP|Okay. Negative on battery Bravo. That's MAIN A, BAT Charlie, closed.
126:22:32|C|Mattingly|Okay. Good. On panel 276: circuit breaker INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL, 3 and 4, open.
126:22:49|T|CMP|Would you say that one again, Ken?
126:22:51|C|Mattingly|All right. On panel 276: circuit breaker INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL, 3 and 4, open.
126:23:17|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 276: CB INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL, 3 and 4, open.
126:23:24|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative. Okay. Panel 5: circuit breaker ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER, MAIN B, closed.
126:23:51|T|CMP|Okay. On panel 5: Hold on, I've got to switch OMNIs.
126:23:59|C|Mattingly|Okay. I'm sorry, Jack. Would you read that again, please?
126:24:03|T|CMP|Okay. On panel 5: CB ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER, MAIN B, closed,
126:24:10|C|Mattingly|Okay. That's correct. PRIMARY EVAPORATOR WATER CONTROL valve to AUTO.
126:24:24|T|CMP|This is on 382?
126:24:27|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative.
126:24:28|T|CMP|Wha - Wha  -
126:24:30|C|Mattingly|Okay, Jack. We want to put the PRIMARY and the SECONDARY EVAPORATOR WATER CONTROL valves to AUTO.
126:24:37|T|CMP|Okay.
126:24:52|C|Mattingly|And, Jack, can you give us a readout on BAT B and the charger current?
126:25:14|T|CMP|Okay, Ken. That was the PRIMARY and SECONDARY H2O CONTROL valves to AUTO on 382.
126:25:20|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative, and did you copy about the readout on the battery and charger?
126:25:25|T|CMP|Aw, yes. Jim's on his way up.
126:25:27|C|Mattingly|Okay. Thank you. All right, the next little step after your water control valves is to perform the CSM RCS preheat. We'll do that on page E/1-5, steps 35 and 37.
126:25:53|T|CMP|Okay, Ken. We're having a problem with the COMM. You read now?
126:25:57|C|Mattingly|Yes, sir. Loud and clear.
126:26:04|T|CMP|Okay. It's perform CM - CSM RCS preheat, and could you say again all after?
126:26:11|C|Mattingly|Okay. I'm referring to the entry checklist, page E/1-5, steps 35 and 37.
126:26:33|T|CMP|Okay. Perform CSM RCS preheat per entry checklist, page 1-5, steps 35 and 37.
126:26:43|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative. Now back to panel 5: circuit breaker CAUTION AND WARNING, MAIN B, closed.
126:26:59|T|CMP|CB CAUTION AND WARNING, MAIN B, closed.
126:27:02|C|Mattingly|That's affirm. On panel 2: CAUTION AND WARNING POWER to 1.
126:27:15|T|CMP|Panel 2: CAUTION AND WARNING POWER to 1.
126:27:20|C|Mattingly|That was POWER to number 1, Jack.
126:27:26|T|CMP|CAUTION AND WARNING POWER to 1.
126:27:29|C|Mattingly|Okay. On panel 5: circuit breaker EPS SENSOR UNIT, DC BUS A and B, closed.
126:27:50|T|CMP|Okay, Ken. The COMM from you is awful weak - awful weak, I - I can't - it's CB EPS SENSOR UNIT. Say again, after that.
126:27:59|C|Mattingly|All right, Jack. That's CB EPS SENSOR UNIT, DC, that's Delta Charlie, BUS A and B, closed.
126:28:16|T|CMP|Okay. CB EPS SENSOR UNIT, DC BUS A and B, close. And I'll give you the volts and amps.
126:28:27|C|Mattingly|Okay, that's correct. Go ahead.
126:28:29|T|CMP|Okay. Volts are 39.1; amps, 1.5.
126:28:45|C|Mattingly|Okay. On panel 3: MAIN BUS A and B, go to RESET and leave it in the center.
126:29:06|T|CMP|Okay, panel 3 - Stand by; got to change OMNI's.
126:29:19|T|CMP|Okay. MAIN BUS A and B, RESET, then center.
126:29:27|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative. Okay, now we're at EI minus 5 plus 05. And, as far as you're concerned, Jack, the command module is using this for information only. This will be the LM doing an Earth terminator AGS alignment; and at the time of 5 plus 05 is the time they'll be going ahead and releasing their ball. And this will be covered in the LM checklist; it'll be uplinked after this one. At EI minus 5, we perform midcourse number 7. Over.
126:30:16|T|CMP|Okay. At EI minus 05:05, the LM is making an Earth-terminator align; and at EI minus 05:00, we perform MCC-7.
126:30:27|C|Mattingly|That's correct. At the completion of midcourse 7, the LM will maneuver to a separation attitude. And this attitude will be sent up on one of the PADs that you're going to get before all the sequence starts. And it'll be flown to the LM ball angles on that PAD.
126:30:47|T|CMP|Okay. Understand.
126:30:50|C|Mattingly|All right. At EI minus 4 plus 40, we want to perform page 1-6, step 39 of the entry checklist.
126:31:07|T|CMP|Ken, I - I didn't, get it. We had to change OMNI's again. Could you say it - the EI minus 4 dash - or 04:40, we do something.
126:31:15|C|Mattingly|Okay. And at that time, you'll want to perform step 39 of page E/1-6. Over.
126:31:31|T|CMP|Okay. Perform step 39 of entry checklist page E/1-6.
126:31:39|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Okay. The next is the command module RCS activation, and that's step 4-1 of page E/1-6.
126:32:13|T|CMP|Okay. The next is perform CSM - or CM RCS activation for step 4-1 of page E - E/1-6.
126:32:28|C|Mattingly|That's correct.
126:32:41|C|Mattingly|All right, Jack. The next is at EI minus 4 plus 30. We want to verify that the LM is configured for command module RCS hotfire.
126:33:08|T|CMP|Okay. Verify LM configure for RCS hotfire at EI minus 04:30.
126:33:16|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Now to panel 5: circuit breaker G&N IMU HEATER, MAIN B, closed.
126:33:41|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 5: CB G&N IMU HEATER, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
126:33:49|C|Mattingly|That's negative, Jack. That's MAIN B only.
126:33:59|T|CMP|Okay. MAIN B only.
126:34:02|C|Mattingly|I'm sorry, I lost you that time. Say it again.
126:34:08|T|CMP|Okay. Let's repeat it. Stand by. Cut out. We've really got a strange attitude, so this is why we are having the COMM problem. Panel 5: CB G&N IMU HEATER, MAIN B, closed.
126:34:24|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative. On panel 1: ROTATION CONTROL POWER, NORMAL. That's two of them, to AC/DC.
126:34:42|T|CMP|Okay, panel 1: RHC, NORMAL, two to AC/DC, two controllers.
126:34:48|C|Mattingly|That's correct. On panel 7: SCS, LOGIC POWER 2/3, ON.
126:35:03|T|CMP|SCS, LOGIC POWER 2/3, ON, panel 7.
126:35:09|C|Mattingly|That's affirm. Back to panel 2: RCS COMMAND, ON.
126:35:20|T|CMP|Panel 2: RCS COMMAND, ON.
126:35:25|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Now the command module RCS check per step 4 of page E/2-1.
126:35:44|T|CMP|Okay. Perform the command module RCS check per step 4, page 2-1.
126:35:49|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Okay, at this point, we want to lock the rotation hand controllers.
126:36:09|T|CMP|Okay. After that, lock both rotation hand controllers.
126:36:14|C|Mattingly|That's affirm. On panel 8: SEQUENTIAL, PYRO ARM, two to ARM.
126:36:37|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 8: SEQ PYRO ARM, two, to ARM. Do I get a MSFN GO for that?
126:36:43|C|Mattingly|That's negative, Jack. We haven't powered up any of the downlink at this time. You'll be doing this and the command module RCS pressurization both by yourself.
126:36:57|T|CMP|Okay.
126:37:00|C|Mattingly|Okay. Now, the next event is going to be the separation of the service module, and these are some LM steps, but so that you will know what is going on, I'll read them to you. The LM will do a LM plus-X of one-half foot per second. Then you'll be hitting the CM SM SEP on and up, on their command. As soon as we are free of the service module, the LM will do another LM minus-X for 0.5 feet per second. This is called the push-pull maneuver. I think it was described this afternoon.
126:37:46|T|CMP|Yes, Ken. It was, I heard about it.
126:37:49|C|Mattingly|Okay. I just wanted you to know that's the sequence you're in. Okay. At the completion of that, we go back to panel 8, and it's SEQUENTIAL, PYRO ARM, both of them, to SAFE.
126:38:16|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 8: SEQ PYRO ARM, two, to SAFE.
126:38:28|C|Mattingly|Okay. And following this, we take SEQUENTIAL, LOGIC, two, to OFF.
126:38:43|T|CMP|Okay. LOGIC, two, to OFF.
126:38:48|C|Mattingly|I'm sorry, Jack. I'll have to ask you to repeat that.
126:38:58|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 8: SEQ LOGIC, two, to OFF. Are they ON now, Ken? I don't remember turning them - I guess that's part of one of the other sequences, huh? That we turned them ON?
126:39:08|C|Mattingly|That's affirm. The reason we're turning the logic off, Jack, is a power savings. So we'll be turning them off, and I'll be getting them back on when we go to get off of the LM; and then turn them back off, then we'll be turning them on prior to entry. Just so you know what's coming.
126:39:25|T|CMP|Okay, real fine.
126:39:28|C|Mattingly|Okay. Then following this, the LM will pitch up to acquire the Moon - Excuse me, they're going to pitch up and acquire the service module and photograph, and they'll be using the ACA for rotations from now on. And you may see the LM out of window number 5 at the same time they pitch up to acquire it.
126:40:02|T|CMP|Okay. The LM pitches up, acquires the service module and photographs it, and I should expect to find - might possibly see the service module out of window 5.
126:40:12|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative. Okay, now we're down to EI minus 3 hours, or the next time-event, and the LM starts a maneuver to what we call the Moon-view attitude. This maneuver is designed to place the command module optics pointing with zero zero at the Moon, and it will be flown to on the LM ball angle.
126:40:57|T|CMP|Okay, the LM maneuvers to the Moon-viewing attitude which would place the Moon in the center of the command module optics with them at zero zero.
126:41:08|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative. Okay, now we're going to panel 5, and it's circuit breaker G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN B, closed.
126:41:28|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 5: CB G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN B, closed.
126:41:35|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative. Now you're going to come up with a 37 ENTER 06 ENTER most likely on the computer. And what we want to do is to put the computer to standby; if you come up with a 37 06, you'll have to do an ENTER in order to get the code 62. If it's got 62 on it, you can do a PROCEED until the DSKY blanks. You might remember that the AC is still off at this time so you won't be getting the STANDBY status light, and your cue that the computer is indeed in standby is when the DSKY goes blank.
126:42:16|T|CMP|Okay. You're saying that I will probably get a PROGRAM 06 with a VERB 37 ENTER flashing.
126:42:27|C|Mattingly|I expect that you  -
126:42:28|T|CMP|ENTER 06.
126:42:29|C|Mattingly|I expect you are  -
126:42:30|T|CMP|Say again, Ken.
126:42:32|C|Mattingly|Yes. We think that you're going to come up with a 37 06 already on the DSKY. If you do, do an ENTER and that should take you to the code 00062, which is the request for standby. And when you get that, hit PROCEED until the DSKY blanks. If you come up with something else, that's where we want to end up anyhow. With either, when you get the code 62 when it comes up, just do a PROCEED on it.
126:43:05|T|CMP|Okay. Is there anything else I could get?
126:43:12|C|Mattingly|I don't believe so, Jack. That's one that when you get to that step, if you do get something else, we will be standing by to see that you see. The whole scheme is to go to standby.
126:43:23|T|CMP|Will you be getting it on downlink?
126:43:25|C|Mattingly|No, sir. We don't have that powered up yet.
126:43:29|T|CMP|Okay. I'll yell to Jim, and Jim will give you a call.
126:43:33|C|Mattingly|Okay. The basic thing, Jack, is just to get the computer in standby to save power.
126:43:40|T|CMP|Okay.
126:43:41|C|Mattingly|And we need another battery B readout.
126:43:56|T|CMP|Okay. He is on his way. Go ahead.
126:43:58|C|Mattingly|Okay. Now, we're at EI minus 2 plus 30; we're going to panel 5: circuit breaker ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION, MAIN A, closed.
126:44:20|T|CMP|Okay, CB ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION, MAIN A, closed.
126:44:25|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Now circuit breaker G&N, IMU HEATER, MAIN A, closed.
126:44:42|T|CMP|CB G&N, IMU HEATER, MAIN A, closed.
126:44:47|C|Mattingly|That's correct. CB LM POWER-1 and -2, open.
126:45:01|T|CMP|CB LM POWER-1 and -2, open.
126:45:05|C|Mattingly|That's correct. CB G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN A, closed.
126:45:22|T|CMP|CB G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN A, closed.
126:45:26|C|Mattingly|Okay, Jack. And that's correct. I got it out of sequence. Would you put that COMPUTER, MAIN A, ahead of LM POWER?
126:45:51|T|CMP|Okay, Ken. That's CB G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN A, closed, goes before CB LM POWER-1 and -2, open.
126:45:59|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Jack, what we're doing is we've had the LM powering MAIN B, and we've had all these particular loads on it, and we're getting ready to secure LM power so we wanted to make sure that essential things like the computer, the platform, and all have dioded power supplies before we remove the LM power.
126:46:19|T|CMP|Okay. Sounds good. Volts, 39.1; amps, 1.3.
126:46:28|C|Mattingly|Okay. Thank you. All right, now panel 275: circuit breaker MAIN B, BATTERY BUS B, closed.
126:46:48|T|CMP|Panel 275: CB MAIN B, BAT BUS B, closed.
126:46:53|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Circuit breaker INVERTER POWER 1, 2, and 3, closed.

126:48:00|C|Mattingly|That's correct. On panel 3: AC INVERTER 1, MAIN A.
126:48:13|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 3: AC INVERTER 1 to MAIN A.
126:48:19|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Now, AC INVERTER 1, AC BUS 1, ON.
126:48:38|T|CMP|Okay. AC INVERTER 1 to AC BUS 1 to ON.
126:48:45|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And we're going to also put AC INVERTER 1, AC BUS 2, ON.
126:49:04|T|CMP|Okay. AC INVERTER 1 to AC BUS 2, ON.
126:49:09|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Back to panel 5. Circuit breaker EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC 1 and 2, closed.
126:49:27|T|CMP|Stand by, Ken. I'm going to switch OMNIs here. You got cut out.
126:49:30|C|Mattingly|Roger.
126:49:37|T|CMP|Okay. Could you repeat that, please?
126:49:38|C|Mattingly|Okay. On panel 5: circuit breakers EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC 1 and 2, closed.
126:49:56|T|CMP|Okay. CB EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC 1 and AC 2, closed.
126:50:04|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Circuit breaker EPS SENSOR UNIT, AC 1 and 2, closed.
126:50:21|T|CMP|Okay. CBS - CB EPS SENSOR UNIT, AC 1 and AC 2, closed.
126:50:29|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And circuit breaker CAUTION/WARNING, MAIN A, closed.
126:50:41|T|CMP|CB CAUTION/WARNING, MAIN A, closed.
126:50:45|C|Mattingly|That's correct. On panel 3: AC INVERTER, AC BUS 1 and 2, RESET and back to the center.
126:51:09|T|CMP|AC INVERTER, BUS 1 and 2, RESET then center.
126:51:15|C|Mattingly|That's correct. On panel 225: circuit breaker FLIGHT BUS, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
126:51:35|T|CMP|Okay, panel - Okay, CB, FLIGHT BUS, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
126:51:47|C|Mattingly|That's correct. CB CTE, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
126:52:05|T|CMP|CB CTE, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
126:52:10|C|Mattingly|That's correct. On panel 4: TELCOM, GROUP 1, AC1.
126:52:23|T|CMP|TELCOM, GROUP 1, to AC1.
126:52:27|C|Mattingly|And TELCOM, GROUP 2, to AC2.
126:52:38|T|CMP|TELCOM, GROUP 2, to AC2.
126:52:41|C|Mattingly|That's correct. On panel 3: S-BAND NORMAL, TRANSPONDER, to PRIMARY.
126:52:56|T|CMP|S-BAND NORMAL, TRANSPONDER, to PRIMARY.
126:53:00|C|Mattingly|That's correct. We want to take POWER, SCE, to NORMAL.
126:53:12|T|CMP|POWER, SCE, to NORMAL.
126:53:14|C|Mattingly|All right, and POWER, PMP, to NORMAL.
126:53:24|T|CMP|POWER, PMP, to NORMAL.
126:53:27|C|Mattingly|That's correct, and UP TELEMETRY, COMMAND RESET to RESET and then NORMAL.
126:53:47|T|CMP|UP TELEMETRY, COMMAND RESET to RESET, then NORMAL.
126:53:51|C|Mattingly|Okay. On panel 2: UP TELEMETRY, CMC, to ACCEPT.
126:54:05|T|CMP|UP TELEMETRY, CMC to ACCEPT.
126:54:09|C|Mattingly|On panel 275: circuit breaker FLIGHT/POSTLANDING, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
126:54:26|T|CMP|A panel 275: CB FLIGHT/POSTLANDING, MAIN A and MAIN B, close.
126:54:33|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And configure for COMM on panels 6, 9, and 10.
126:54:51|T|CMP|Okay.
126:55:04|T|CMP|Okay, are you with me.
126:55:06|C|Mattingly|All right. You got that. Panel 5: circuit breaker IMU, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
126:55:23|T|CMP|CB IMU, MAIN A and MAIN B, close.
126:55:28|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Circuit breaker OPTICS, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
126:55:41|T|CMP|Okay. CB OPTICS, MAIN A and MAIN B, close.
126:55:46|C|Mattingly|That's correct. CB G&N, POWER, AC1 and AC2, closed.
126:56:01|T|CMP|CB G&N, POWER, AC1 and AC2, close.
126:56:06|C|Mattingly|That's correct, and the G&N POWER switch to AC2.
126:56:18|T|CMP|Okay, G&N POWER switch to AC2.
126:56:22|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Now we want to perform the CMC powerup per the CSM G&C checklist, G 2-2.
126:56:44|T|CMP|Perform CMC powerup per the G&C checklist, page 2-2.
126:56:50|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Perform the EMS check, step 32 of the entry book, page 1-4.
126:57:16|T|CMP|Okay. Perform the EMS check per step 32 per the entry checklist, page 1-4.
126:57:26|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Okay, now the ground is going to give you a P27 update, at EI minus 2 plus 15. That's a - that's a time that you need to be configured to accept up telemetry. And what they're going to give you on a P27 update will be a clock increment, a state vector; they'll give you a VERB66; they'll give you two REFSMMATs, there'll be a actual and a preferred; and the entry target load. Now, if you'd like to copy those, I can take it a little slower.
126:58:13|T|CMP|No, I've got them. They are going to give me a clock DELTA, state vector, VERB 66, two REFSMMATs, and an entry target load.
126:58:20|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Okay, and then we'll do  -
126:58:24|T|CMP|There isn't much else they could give me, is there, Ken?
126:58:28|C|Mattingly|No, not very much. How about IMU powerup according to the G&C checklist, G/2-1.
126:58:50|T|CMP|Okay. Perform IMU powerup per G&C checklist, page 2-1.
126:58:58|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And while you are there, you can do the optics powerup on G/2-3.
126:59:21|T|CMP|Perform the optics powerup per page 2-3.
126:59:25|C|Mattingly|That's correct; and on panel 229: circuit breaker TIMERS, MAIN A, closed.
126:59:46|T|CMP|Okay. Panel 229: CB TIMER, MAIN A, closed.
126:59:52|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And the next thing you will do will be to set the mission timer and what we've done is to only turn on the mission timer on the MDC. And you'll probably have to wait here until they get through with the uplink so you can have the computer.
127:00:10|T|CMP|Okay. Set it from the CMC, huh?
127:00:13|C|Mattingly|That's affirm. Okay. Now, we are getting ready to start the alignment sequence, and are you familiar with the general sequence of events we're going to use, Jack?
127:00:29|T|CMP|How do you mean? We are going to make an alignment on the Moon and on the Sun; other than that - I didn't get any - I wasn't on the headset when the general information was passed up, so if there was any more than that, I didn't get it.
127:00:45|C|Mattingly|Okay. Basically, that is correct. Let me just run through it hand-waving type for a minute, and then I'll read you the steps. I think it will make more sense. The scheme is that the LM can fly to a set of ball angles that will point your optics at the Moon. Now, at any time, in any attitude that we happen to be at, if you can look in the telescope and recognize star patterns sufficient that you believe you can make an alignment all on your own, that's the place we'd like to break off and let you go ahead and take over with your own alignment. However, we are giving you a procedure which will give you things we know you can see in the telescope without worrying about any reflections or anything of that nature, and it's not intended that this procedure has to be followed past the point where you know you've got good definition of star patterns in your telescope. If you need to go on, we'll maneuver, take a look at the Moon, we'll take a mark there, and then we'll maneuver with the LM/FDAI angles again and take a look at the Sun, and get yourself another mark on the Sun and that will complete the alignment. Now, the alignment scheme is that we are going to give you a set of angles that you can coarse align the ball through when the LM is pointing you at the Moon. Now, this set of angles will agree with the REFSMMAT that you have in as a nominal REFSMMAT in your CMC. You can coarse align to that, set a drift flag and REFSMMAT flag, and you'll have a good platform and we'll be within a couple of degrees of a good alignment. And, if we have to, we could break off at this point and go ahead with an entry; however, in an attempt to get a good platform, we are going to have you then do a P52 option 1, and what you are going to find in the option 1 slots is the entry REFSMMAT. You'll come up with the NOUN 22 values, and we intend to go ahead and coarse align the ball to the entry REFSMMAT attitude, and then we'll go ahead and take marks through a normal P52 sequence. So that's the general scheme that we are going to use. If you think you have a handle on that, I will go ahead and read you the steps.
127:03:11|T|CMP|Okay. Well, let me ask a question. The LM maneuvers to a set of Moon-viewing angles. Okay, at this time, I am going to do a P52, is that right? With the planet option?
127:03:29|C|Mattingly|The first thing we are going to do is to coarse align the platform and get it inertial, based on the REFSMMAT that you have in the present slots inside the CMC. We'll then go - and do a P52, option 4 - Correction, option 1.
127:03:48|T|CMP|Okay - That's after the LM gets established at the attitude. Jim says I'm here at the Moon-viewing attitude, I do a VERB 41 NOUN 20 to the set of angles that you're going to give me in the PAD.
127:04:00|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative  -
127:04:01|T|CMP|And then I enter the P52.
127:04:03|C|Mattingly|That's correct.
127:04:04|T|CMP|Okay. Then I enter the P52 and that's an option 3, right?
127:04:11|C|Mattingly|The P52 will be done as an option 1. The only reason you have the other REFSMMAT inside the computer is that in order to set the REFSMMAT flag, you need some relative orientation.
127:04:22|T|CMP|Okay. I see. I do a P52 option 1, and when do I set the REFSMMAT flag and the drift flag?
127:04:33|C|Mattingly|That will be before entering P52. I am going to give you this procedure in detail.
127:04:38|T|CMP|Okay. All right. Let's go at it. Maybe it'll all fall out and I won't have any questions. Go ahead.
127:04:45|C|Mattingly|Okay. I'm ready to start reading again. We start with a VERB 41 NOUN 20.
127:05:08|T|CMP|Okay. When the LM is in the Moon-viewing attitude, I do a VERB 41 NOUN 20, ENTER.
127:05:14|C|Mattingly|That's right. And you'll put in the attitudes that you'll get from one of the PADs, and this will be for the coarse align angles when the LM is at the Moon-viewing attitude. Then when they're all squared away, I tell you they have the right attitude; we then pick up again with a VERB 40 NOUN 20, ENTER.
127:05:45|T|CMP|Okay. VERB 40 NOUN 20, ENTER when Moon is - the LM is satisfied that they're at the Moon-viewing attitude.
127:05:53|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Now we're going to set the REFSMMAT and drift flags according to the G&C checklist, page G/7-1, steps 3 and 4.
127:06:15|T|CMP|Okay. Set the REFSMMAT flag for G&C 7-1, steps 3 and 4.
127:06:20|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Now VERB 37, ENTER; 52, ENTER; option 1.
127:06:33|T|CMP|VERB 37, ENTER; 52, ENTER; option 1.
127:06:36|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And we'll do the coarse align.
127:06:49|T|CMP|Okay. Perform the coarse align function.
127:06:53|C|Mattingly|Okay. Now when it gets back to the mark routines, we want to take a mark on the Moon.
127:07:06|T|CMP|Okay. Mark on the Moon with the crosshairs in the center. Is that right?
127:07:10|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative. Okay. When that's complete, the LM will maneuver to the Sun-viewing angle for attitude. And when they get there, you take a mark on the Sun using the Sun filter and the telescope; and, again, we're marking on the center.
127:07:39|T|CMP|Okay. Now, let me ask you a question. Is the first mark on the Moon made with the - are all these made with the telescope and not the sextant?
127:07:49|C|Mattingly|If - I'm not sure right offhand what the angular size of the Moon is, Jack. If you can get it in the sextant; that's the best thing to do, but you may have to go into the telescope in order to define the center. Either one's acceptable.
127:08:04|T|CMP|Okay. If I can define the center through the sextant, do it that way. And if I can't, use the telescope.
127:08:10|C|Mattingly|That's affirmed. We know you're going to use the telescope on the Sun.
127:08:23|C|Mattingly|Okay. You ready to press on?
127:08:29|T|CMP|I'm ready.
127:08:30|C|Mattingly|Okay. Just reminded we owe somebody a BAT B voltage.
127:08:37|T|CMP|Okay, another volts and amps coming up.
127:08:40|C|Mattingly|All right. Thank you. And this left us in P52 with two marks, and we'll go ahead and torque the NOUN 93s.
127:09:03|T|CMP|Okay. ... torque the NOUN 93s, after the two marks.
127:09:08|C|Mattingly|Okay. So that gives us a good platform. Now the LM will maneuver to the jettison attitude, and the only thing of significance here is that you want to watch to make sure that the path they choose to go to the jettison attitude avoids gimbal lock on your own platform.
127:09:38|T|CMP|Okay. The LM maneuvers to the jettison attitude and I just monitor the maneuver and yell at Jim if he gets near a gimbal lock.
127:09:46|C|Mattingly|That's affirmed. Okay, and then the LM will go to a MAX deadband attitude hold in the jettison attitude.
127:10:04|T|CMP|Okay. The LM goes to MAX deadband attitude hold.
127:10:09|C|Mattingly|Okay. Now we're ready to go back to work. The next thing we'll do is to continue to powerup procedures. Do you have any further questions on that alignment, Jack?
127:10:18|T|CMP|No. No. I think - I think it's all self-explanatory now.
127:10:23|C|Mattingly|Okay. The one thing that everybody would like for you to understand is we certainly don't insist on using the Moon and the Earth; if you find you have good stars, why use them. However, this alignment is more than adequate to give us a good guided entry.
127:10:40|T|CMP|Okay. If I get a set of good stars, do I start right out to a basic P51 and a P52 option 1?
127:10:50|C|Mattingly|That's affirmative.
127:10:53|T|CMP|Okay.
127:10:55|C|Mattingly|Okay. Now, we're ready to go to work on panel 275. And it starts with a circuit breaker MAIN A  -
127:11:01|T|CMP|Wait - wait just a minute. Wait just a minute. I owe you some volts and amps.
127:11:06|C|Mattingly|Okay. All right.
127:11:09|T|CMP|Okay. Volts are 39.4, amps, 1.25.
127:11:15|C|Mattingly|Okay. I thought maybe your meter was stuck before.
127:11:21|T|CMP|No (laughter).
127:11:24|C|Mattingly|All right. You ready to go back to 275? Have a circuit breaker MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed.
127:11:42|T|CMP|CB MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed.
127:11:45|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And circuit breaker MAIN B, BAT C, closed.
127:11:57|T|CMP|CB MAIN Baker, BAT Charlie, closed.
127:12:00|C|Mattingly|Okay. That's correct. Now we're up to EI minus 1 plus 30. And at this time, we're going to proceed with the closeout and hatch installation.
127:12:30|T|CMP|Okay. Closeout and hatch installation at EI minus 01:30.
127:12:35|C|Mattingly|That's right, Jack, and we're going to close the LM hatch, and we'll make the dump valve in the LM hatch closed.
127:12:51|T|CMP|Understand you're going to close the dump valve, now on the LM hatch, right?
127:12:56|C|Mattingly|That's correct.
127:12:57|T|CMP|Okay. This is a change from what we had understood previously.
127:13:01|C|Mattingly|That's correct.
127:13:03|T|CMP|I'm - Personally, I'm happy to see it, but that's good.
127:13:06|C|Mattingly|Okay. That's one vote on your side. Okay; and we're going to go ahead and do the - use the decal to perform the hatch installation, and we'll start on the hatch integrity check.
127:13:39|T|CMP|Okay. Per the decal, perform the hatch installation and start on the hatch integrity check.
127:13:49|C|Mattingly|That's correct.
127:13:53|T|CMP|Okay, Ken. One thing I think that - I don't know whether anybody - the decal don't take into account the fact that we still have the umbilicals connected. At what point in time should they be removed?
127:14:10|C|Mattingly|Okay, Jack. That doesn't matter. We're going to be separating the tunnel upstream of those umbilicals, and you can leave them right there.
127:14:24|T|CMP|Okay. Does it make any difference if we disengage - the LM - We have pulled the circuit breakers LM POWER-1 and -2, so if we choose to disconnect these umbilicals, there's no harm, right?
127:14:41|C|Mattingly|That's right. No sweat. John Aaron's just saying that they may he hot. He's checking on it, so how about holding a decision on that and let me come back to you?
127:14:54|T|CMP|Okay.
127:14:59|C|Mattingly|Okay. And let me tell you what we're going to do since we told you a different story this afternoon on this tunnel. We're actually going to vent the tunnel down so that we end up with about 1-1/2 to 2 psi absolute in the tunnel. And this will give us a DELTA-P of 3. So we'll do our hatch integrity check at the same time we're venting the tunnel down.
127:15:24|T|CMP|Okay. It sounds good.
127:15:26|C|Mattingly|Okay. Now let me give you some plumbing switches here. Let's take the SURGE TANK OXYGEN valve to ON.
127:15:45|T|CMP|SURGE TANK O2 to ON.
127:15:48|C|Mattingly|All right. Take the MAIN REGs, two, OPEN.
127:15:59|T|CMP|MAIN REGs, two, to OPEN.
127:16:02|C|Mattingly|Okay. And the WATER AND GLYCOL TANK PRESSURE, the PRESSURE valve and the RELIEF valve to BOTH.
127:16:20|T|CMP|Okay, WATER AND GLYCOL TANKS PRESSURE and RELIEF valve to BOTH.
127:16:26|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE valve to BOTH.
127:16:40|T|CMP|EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE to BOTH.
127:16:43|C|Mattingly|That's correct; and the SUIT DEMAND REGs to BOTH.
127:16:55|T|CMP|SUIT DEMAND REGs to BOTH.
127:16:58|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Okay, now we're going to panel 5: circuit breaker ECS TRANSDUCERs, PRESSURE GROUP 1 and 2, MAIN A and MAIN B. That's four circuit breakers, closed.
127:17:26|T|CMP|ECS TRANSDUCERs, GROUP 1 and 2, MAIN A and MAIN B, four, to close.
127:17:32|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Okay, now. Circuit breaker ECS TRANSDUCER, TEMPERATURE, MAIN A and MAIN B, that's two of them, closed.
127:17:51|T|CMP|CB ECS TRANSDUCER, TEMPERATURE, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
127:17:57|C|Mattingly|That's correct. On panel 4: PRIMARY ECS GLYCOL PUMPS, one, to AC 1.
127:18:13|T|CMP|Primary ECS GLYCOL PUMPS to 1, AC1.
127:18:17|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Okay, then we'll finish going back to the tunnel vent, and verify the LM/CM DELTA-P and make sure it's been holding pressure. And we'll come back again and rehash all of the hatch integrity check and tunnel vent procedures with you. The next thing I want to read off is the EI minus 1 plus 20. We'll go to panel 7: BMAG number 1 POWER to WARM UP.
127:19:11|T|CMP|BMAG number 1 POWER to WARM UP.
127:19:15|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Then at EI minus 1 plus 10, we'll perform SCS powerup per checklist, page G/2-4.
127:19:35|T|CMP|Okay. Perform SCS powerup per G&C checklist, page 2-4.
127:19:42|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Okay, on panel 4: SUIT COMPRESSOR NUMBER 2 to AC1.
127:19:58|T|CMP|SUIT COMPRESSOR 2 to AC1.
127:20:01|C|Mattingly|That's correct. SPACECRAFT CONTROL to SCS.
127:20:20|T|CMP|SPACECRAFT CONTROL to SCS.
127:20:23|C|Mattingly|Okay. And your MANUAL ATTITUDE switches, as you desire. We're coming up on jettison of the LM, so that's just like separation.
127:20:42|T|CMP|Okay.
127:20:44|C|Mattingly|Okay. And we'll do a GDC align.
127:21:01|T|CMP|Okay. Perform a GDC align.
127:21:03|C|Mattingly|Okay. On panel 8: ROTATION CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, 1 and 2, MAIN A/MAIN B.
127:21:29|T|CMP|Okay. These are circuit breakers, ROTATION CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, 1 and 2, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed?
127:21:42|C|Mattingly|Okay, Jack. I wasn't thinking switch. Let me verify that's a circuit breaker, too. I think we have to get both of them.
127:21:52|T|CMP|Okay, there's those four circuit breakers over there, Ken. When you said panel 8, that's what I thought you were talking about. I don't think the circuit breakers are out right now, but why don't we just put - verify the circuit breakers and put the switches to MAIN A/MAIN B.
127:22:17|C|Mattingly|Okay, that's correct, Jack. Okay, at EI minus 1 hour, we're going to be doing the LM jettison; so just prior to that, we want to do a P47.
127:22:47|T|CMP|Okay, say at about 1 minute prior to LM jettison, huh?
127:22:55|C|Mattingly|Yes, just something that's comfortable for you.
127:23:07|T|CMP|Okay.
127:23:08|C|Mattingly|All right, after we've done that, we want to get panel 8, SEQUENTIAL, PYRO ARM, two of them, ON.
127:23:25|T|CMP|Okay. I get a GO fron MSFN for this?
127:23:32|C|Mattingly|Okay, John says we can watch it.
127:23:43|T|CMP|Okay.
127:23:44|C|Mattingly|All right; the next thing is CSM/LM FINAL SEP, two of them, ON, up.
127:23:59|T|CMP|CSM/LM FINAL SEP, two, ON.
127:24:02|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Now we're going back to panel 8, and it's SEQUENTIAL, PYRO ARM, two of them, to SAFE.
127:24:28|T|CMP|Okay. SEQ PYRO ARM, two, to SAFE.
127:24:31|C|Mattingly|That's correct, and go back to P00.
127:24:42|T|CMP|Okay. Go to P00.
127:24:44|C|Mattingly|All right. And now it's time to configure for single ring.
127:25:00|T|CMP|Okay. Configure for single ring RCS.
127:25:03|C|Mattingly|That's right, and since you're still an hour from EI, I guess it wouldn't hurt to use MINIMUM IMPULSE or something like that rather than the DAP, at least not until you get closer down. We'll have the DAP loads for you later.
127:25:25|T|CMP|... - Okay.
127:25:26|C|Mattingly|Okay. And as soon as you've gotten yourself all set up with a good control mode, you want to maneuver to the entry attitude.
127:25:45|T|CMP|Maneuver to entry attitude per the PAD.
127:25:47|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And we show EI minus 55, which really means when you get to the entry attitude, we have a sextant star check for you. And that will be on the PAD.
127:26:11|T|CMP|Okay. Perform a sextant star check.
127:26:14|C|Mattingly|Okay. And I want to remind you to park the optics at 90 degrees of shaft.
127:26:26|T|CMP|Okay. Say again why, Ken. I didn't understand that.
127:26:31|C|Mattingly|Okay, this is just a precaution, Jack. If we park the optics with a 90-degree shaft angle, that will line up the slit's so it gives you the best airflow over that part of the heat shield and avoids a hot spot. If you don't remember it, I don't think it makes much difference. It's just good procedure.
127:26:52|T|CMP|Okay.
127:26:55|C|Mattingly|Okay. And after you've got it parked wherever you want it, well, turn the OPTICS POWER OFF and stow the optics.
127:27:14|T|CMP|Okay. OPTICS POWER, OFF; stow the optics.
127:27:17|C|Mattingly|Okay, that's good, Okay. The next thing we'll do is to initialize the EMS and that's on entry checklist page 2-1, step number 2.
127:27:40|T|CMP|Okay, perform EMS initialization per entry checklist page 2-1, step 2.
127:27:46|C|Mattingly|Okay, that's correct. Now we're coming up on EI minus 45 minutes, and we'll give you an entry PAD and a final state vector.
127:28:12|T|CMP|Okay, at minus 45, entry PAD and final state vector from MSFN.
127:28:17|C|Mattingly|Okay. Now we're going to perform what we call the Moon check. Rather than go into detail, if you alredy know what we're doing just say so; otherwise, I'll describe the use of the Moon-attitude set.
127:28:38|T|CMP|Maybe you better describe it.
127:28:41|C|Mattingly|Okay, Jack. You remember everybody in the past has commented on seeing Moonset just a couple minutes prior to EI, and your horizon will probably be dark at the time that you get there; you're having an early morning entry; and coming in from the west, you'll still be looking at a dark horizon. So, just as a backup technique, just like you would track the horizon, we're going to give you an attitude which will be on the PAD so that you can look directly at the Moon. This is an inertial attitude; it won't be changing, if you'll put the 36-degree window line on the Moon, and then just sit there and watch it. And just prior to EI, the Earth will come up and occult it, and you will then have a good horizon check. And I have some times, and I'll give you that later. And if you just look at this thing now, at that point you can set the GDC or whatever you desire. And you will have a known attitude reference. It's just like a horizon check.
127:29:47|T|CMP|Okay, I maneuver to the Moon check attitude; at which time I put the 36 window line on the Moon, and just prior to EI, the Earth will occult the Moon.
127:30:03|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And that corresponds to the same inertial attitude that you'd have on the back of your entry card where it shows the horizon attitude several minutes prior to EI; it's the same thing.
127:30:21|T|CMP|Yes, that's that one at 17 minutes prior. Okay.
127:30:24|C|Mattingly|Okay, and we're just getting it in a little closer. Okay, the next item on the check - checklist here is an EI minus 40; we're going to panel 7, and it's BMAG NUMBER 2 POWER to WARM UP.
127:30:49|T|CMP|Okay, panel 7: BMAG NUMBER 2 POWER to WARM UP.
127:30:52|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Now, I'd like to verify the SURGE TANK and REPRESS PACKAGES are ON.
127:31:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 127 hours, 31 minutes. We've completed the shift handover in Mission Control. A change of shift briefing is scheduled to begin in about 15 minutes at 9 P.M. in the main News Center Auditorium, in Building 1 -
127:31:13|T|CMP|Verify SURGE TANK and REPRESS PACKAGE are ON.
127:31:16|C|Mattingly|That's correct. On panel 5: circuit breaker ENVIRONMENTAL - CONTROL SYSTEM; WASTE WATER/URINE DUMP HEATER, two of them, closed.
127:31:44|T|CMP|Panel 5: CB ECS, WASTE H2O/URINE DUMP HEATERS, two, to close.
127:31:51|C|Mattingly|That's correct. SUIT COMPRESSOR number 2 to OFF.
127:32:07|T|CMP|SUIT COMPRESSOR 2 to OFF.
127:32:09|C|Mattingly|That's right, Jack, and what this - what we're planning to do in order to conserve power is we're going to run the suit compressor from an hour to this point at minus 40. And we'll be watching the PCO<sub>2</sub>; if that thing's working, we'll turn it off at the earliest time that we have a good cabin, and then we'll just leave it off. And in the event that the PCO<sub>2</sub> gauge isn't working properly or something like that, well, we'll just go ahead and run it for this time frame.
127:32:40|T|CMP|Okay, that sounds good.
127:32:43|C|Mattingly|All right. Now we're at EI minus 30. SEQUENTIAL, LOGIC, that's two of them, to ON, up.
127:32:57|T|CMP|EI minus 30; SEQ, LOGIC, two, ON.
127:33:01|C|Mattingly|Okay, in panel 7: the BMAG number 2 POWER to ON.
127:33:13|T|CMP|Okay, we - you only gave that 10 minutes for the warmup, huh?
127:33:18|C|Mattingly|That's okay.
127:33:20|T|CMP|Okay.
127:33:22|C|Mattingly|All right, and FDAI POWER to BOTH.
127:33:33|T|CMP|FDAI POWER to BOTH.
127:33:36|C|Mattingly|Okay. And we want to activate the primary evaporator.
127:33:54|T|CMP|Okay, activate the primary evaporator. All this time, Ken, what we've been getting our cooling? Right now, I think we have the radiators at PULL TO BYPASS.
127:34:03|C|Mattingly|That's correct. We started out that way, and we turned the glycol pumps on, and we're just circulating it internally. And we're counting on the command module being a heat sink; it's pretty cold soaked, and it looks like this is good enough. You got some relatively low heat loads  -
127:34:20|T|CMP|Okay.
127:34:21|C|Mattingly|-  and we'll keep watching the temps, and if we need it, why we'll start the evaporator early.
127:34:27|T|CMP|Okay, that sounds good.
127:34:29|C|Mattingly|Do you believe it's cold up there?
127:34:33|T|CMP|Yes, and we used to call the command module the bedroom and it's now the refrigerator.
127:34:38|C|Mattingly|Okay, just don't call it the reefer. Okay. At about EI minus 19, we get back into the standard entry checklist on page 2-2, where it starts with P61.
127:35:04|T|CMP|Okay, at EI minus 19, we get back into the entry checklist at page 2-2, where we start entering P61.
127:35:14|C|Mattingly|Okay, Jack. Now that's the - those are the time-line notes I had for you. I hate to tell you this, but I also have a couple of corrections to make to the entry checklist. They aren't corrections, they just are pieces of the entry checklist which will correspond to what I've written - already read to you. And I'm ready to go on that whenever you are. And Vance tells me you can get into the descent water for drinking now.
127:35:42|T|CMP|We can get into the descent water for drinking, huh?
127:35:45|C|Mattingly|Aha.
127:35:47|T|CMP|Sounds good.
127:35:48|C|Brand|Hey, go to it.
127:35:54|T|CMP|Jim would like to know whether the descent water will be good until LM jettison?
127:36:19|C|Mattingly|Okay, Jack. Looks like we're going to go on the ascent tanks at 128:30. And it looks like  -
127:36:29|T|CMP|Okay, understand. We are going  -
127:36:30|C|Mattingly|-  you have plenty of water. I'm sorry we cut each other out; say again.
127:36:34|T|CMP|Okay, yes. I was going to say, understand we're going to go on the ascent tanks at 128:30.
127:36:40|C|Mattingly|That's right; based on the current rate, that's what they predict and you can go ahead and drink the water. No sweat.
127:36:48|T|CMP|Okay, real fine. And I've got the entry checklist out and I'm ready to copy; just give me the page.
127:36:54|C|Mattingly|Okay.
127:36:56|C|Brand|Jack, you're starting to sound like an LMP.
127:37:04|T|CMP|I think I'm probably the only CMP that's ever witnessed an - a LM burn from inside the LM in - in space flight.
127:37:14|C|Mattingly|(Laughter) I hope it stays that way. Okay, Jack, we're starting on page 1-1.
127:37:21|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
127:37:23|C|Mattingly|Okay, down in the middle of the page on line 9, we're just going to strike out the Activate VHF for COMM checks, and line 10, Verify the DSE. We're going to leave the DSE OFF, and that's to save power, as is the VHF activation.
127:37:42|T|CMP|Okay.
127:37:45|C|Mattingly|Okay, on page 1-2. At minus 2 hours, there's a title Logic sequence check; and we're deleting that entire sequence; that's included in what I read up to you.
127:38:03|T|CMP|Okay, delete the logic sequence check at minus 2 hours there.
127:38:09|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And delete lines 23, 24, and 25. That means a maneuver to SUPERCIRC entry attitude. Everything below that is deleted.
127:38:33|T|CMP|Okay. Delete lines 23 through 28.
127:38:38|C|Mattingly|That's correct. You got ahead of me. All right, on line 29 on page 1-3, we're going to put in a time of minus 00:55. That's the time we gave you for the boresight check.
127:38:55|T|CMP|Okay  -
127:38:56|C|Mattingly|That's your sextant check, really.
127:39:05|T|CMP|Got that.
127:39:06|C|Mattingly|Okay, on the top of page 1-4; where it said 1 hour and 15 minutes next to line 32, we're going to change that to Minus 2 hours and 30 minutes.
127:39:22|T|CMP|Okay, minus 02:30 opposite item 32.
127:39:25|C|Mattingly|Okay, down at the bottom of the EMS entry check right there where we are, the bottom line now reads, EMS MODE to STANDBY. Well, just above that - like to remind you to put a remark, Do not initialize the range to go. This is because you're going to come into the EMS entry check, you're going to run through all these things; then we're going to remove power from the EMS. And just didn't want you to get ahead of yourself and initialize the entry parameters, because you'll lose them when we power up.
127:39:59|T|CMP|Okay.
127:40:00|C|Mattingly|And, after we go EMS MODE to STANDBY, like for you to add Circuit breaker EMS, two, to open.
127:40:19|T|CMP|Okay, CB EMS, two, to open.
127:40:21|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And we want to delete this Set up camera that's listed on the bottom of the page. We're deleting that for power reasons. That's line 33 Alfa.
127:40:34|T|CMP|Okay, we're way ahead of you. We already got it stowed.
127:40:39|C|Mattingly|Okay. On the top of the next page where it says Secondary water EVAP, just keep in mind we don't plan to use the secondary evaporators unless the primary fails. On line 35 on page 1-5, next to Command module RCS preheat," the time is now "Minus 06:30.
127:41:14|T|CMP|Okay, minus 06:30, and the voltage reading 3.9 still is good, right?
127:41:21|C|Mattingly|Okay, very good. Under Final stowage, the first thing that's listed on line 36, page 1-5, is Optics. And if you want to get started on your stowage, we'd like to leave the optics out, because we'll have the star check coming up quite a bit after this. The rest of that stuff can be taken care of at your convenience.
127:41:47|T|CMP|Okay.
127:41:48|C|Mattingly|All right, still on page 1-5, line 37; the time is now Minus 06:10.
127:42:03|T|CMP|Got that.
127:42:05|C|Mattingly|Okay, and this is one time it looks like we might actually do the preheat, so that's the reason we want to make sure that we know that not more than 20 minutes of time on the preheat. We may not be able to watch it at that time because you aren't powered up.
127:42:34|T|CMP|Okay. Either 20 minutes or until 3.9 volts DC.
127:42:38|C|Mattingly|That's correct, Jack. And now let's go to page 1-6. And about one-third of the way down, it shows Panel 275 CB MAIN A, BAT C, closed, we want to strike off that line, the next two lines, and we're going to strike out MAIN A, BAT C, closed; MAIN B, BAT C, closed; and DC INDICATOR, MAIN B.
127:43:11|T|CMP|Okay. After that step on panel 275, strike out CB MAIN A, BAT C; CB MAIN B, BAT C; and DC INDICATORS to MAIN B.
127:43:22|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Now under panel 8, it tells you to Close all circuit breakers EXCEPT, and I have four additions. The first one is CB SERVICE MODULE RCS HEATERS, QUAD Charlie, MAIN B, open.
127:43:50|T|CMP|SERVICE MODULE RCS HEATERS, QUAD Charlie, MAIN Baker, open.
127:43:55|C|Mattingly|Okay. And the same thing for SERVICE MODULE RCS HEATER, QUAD Delta, MAIN A, open.
127:44:11|T|CMP|SERVICE MODULE RCS HEATERS, QUAD Delta, MAIN A, open.
127:44:15|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And Circuit breaker EMS, that's two of them, open.
127:44:34|T|CMP|CB EMS, two, to open.</div>
127:44:36|C|Mattingly|All right. And the last is the circuit breakers for SPS GAGING, four of them, open.
127:44:54|T|CMP|SPS GAGING, four to open.
127:44:58|C|Mattingly|Okay. And how about our readout on the battery and that charger?
127:45:05|T|CMP|Okay, BAT's at volts and amps.
127:45:09|C|Mattingly|That's affirmed. And let's go back to page 1-6, line 41. Let's put in a time Minus 04:40.
127:45:20|T|CMP|Minus 04:40.
127:45:22|C|Mattingly|That's correct. On page 2-1, line number 2, put in a time of Minus 55 minutes.
127:45:44|T|CMP|Okay, minus 55 minutes.
127:45:47|C|Mattingly|Okay. And the first thing you want to do under EMS initialization, is circuit breakers EMS, that's two of them, to close.
127:46:01|T|CMP|Okay. CB EMS, two, to close.
127:46:04|C|Mattingly|That's correct. All right. Line 4 or step 4, where it shows CM RCS check. That occurs at minus 04:30.
127:46:17|T|CMP|Okay. Minus 04:30.
127:46:20|C|Mattingly|All right. Under CM RCS checks, the fourth line down says MANUAL ATTITUDE, three, to MINIMUM IMPULSE.We'll have to use ACCEL COMMAND and the reason for that, Jack, is we don't have the SPS powered up so there's no minimum impulse generator.
127:46:39|T|CMP|Okay. MANUAL ATTITUDE, three, to ACCEL COMMAND.
127:46:42|C|Mattingly|That's correct. And on the same page 2-1, strike out the last three lines, starting with RCS transfer to service module.
127:46:57|T|CMP|Right. The last three lines are scratched out. We ain't got one of those things.
127:47:02|C|Mattingly|That's correct. Okay, let's flip to page 2-2 and strike out the first two lines.
127:47:11|T|CMP|Okay. Now wait a second. I need to give you volts and amps, Ken.
127:47:14|C|Mattingly|All right. Go ahead.
127:47:19|T|CMP|Okay. It's 39.6, 1.12.
127:47:25|C|Mattingly|Sounds like you're getting there. Okay. I believe we scratched out the first two lines on 2-2. Now, we're - right below that, it says Separation checklist. So we're going to just delete that whole thing; it's included in the notes I gave you.
127:47:50|T|CMP|Okay. It's included in the notations.
127:47:55|C|Mattingly|All right. Line number 7. It says Maneuver to horizon check attitude. We're going to call this the Moon-check attitude" and this is the one we discussed, Jack. The angle of 265 is not correct. I'll have one of those for you first thing in the morning.
127:48:15|T|CMP|Okay.
127:48:16|C|Mattingly|Okay. And at the bottom of the page, step number 1. That will be at EI minus 19 minutes, and we're off and running through a normal sequence of events.
127:48:32|T|CMP|Okay. That sounds good. Ken, I guess if you've read this thing - Is it a comfortable time line? Any areas where you had problems with?
127:48:42|C|Mattingly|Jack, it is very comfortable. We've run it several times now and, in fact, it's being run right now, again. And we've run it both here at Houston and at the Cape. The only place where you might find that you need to stay ahead of things is during the platform-alignment period, when you're getting ready to close out the LM and then once you get into the command module and jettison the LM, why you're back on a very comfortable time. And, of course, we'll be watching and anything we can do, like keeping track of time for you, we'll remind you of that as we go along.
127:49:16|T|CMP|Hey, that would be good - that would be good, Ken.
127:49:22|C|Mattingly|Okay. Let me emphasize, Jack, that 2-1/2 hours is the earliest time we can start in on that powerup stuff. Everything else you can do the way you normally would, where you get as far ahead of the game as you can. But the 2-1/2- hour time is based on saving command module consumables. And if you do that, why we're fat; we've got plenty of time to give you some fans on the water even. So that's the one point you don't want to start early on. I do have a couple of more lines to run through on the entry checklist and two pages in the G&C. And I think that will clean us up.
127:50:14|T|CMP|Okay, Ken. And G&C checklist now?
127:50:17|C|Mattingly|Let me finish a couple more things in the entry book. You still got that?
127:50:23|T|CMP|Yes. Go ahead.
127:50:24|C|Mattingly|Okay. On - These are just cleanup items, Jack. On page 2-3, it lists how you separate, from the CM/SM SEP and all that, so, obviously, if we're on step 5 at 43 minutes down - that's all deleted. And that gets deleted all the way over onto page 2-4, up to the line where it says 15 minutes. And at that point, we pick back up and everything. From 15 minutes down is valid.
127:51:07|T|CMP|Okay. Delete item 5 down to the point where it says Minus 15 minutes.
127:51:14|C|Mattingly|That's correct, Jack. Okay, on page 2-5. The top line where we had Horizon check, that's now the Moonset check and the time is approximately 57:37. And that's minus 02:23. And that angle that's listed in the book there - 177 - that's really a horizon time at 2 minutes; we'll have you - can look that up on the back of your entry cue card, and I'll look that number up again for you tonight.
127:52:00|T|CMP|Okay.
127:52:01|C|Mattingly|Okay. Another thing is to remember when we begin blackout, which is around 0.05 g, and you can write this in your checklist wherever it's convenient; once we've lost COMM, we're going to go ahead and power down the SCE POWER OFF and the PMP POWER OFF. And we just want to do that after you lose COMM, which comes up around EI. Any time after that, go ahead and secure the PMP and the SCE power.
127:52:42|T|CMP|Okay. When COMM is lost, SCE POWER OFF, PMP POWER OFF.
127:52:47|C|Mattingly|That's correct, Jack, and that completes the entry checklist. Let's look at the G&C book.
127:53:06|T|CMP|Okay. Ready to copy.
127:53:08|C|Mattingly|Okay. Let's go to page 2-1.
127:53:25|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
127:53:27|C|Mattingly|Okay, Jack. The second line under IMU powerup says FDAI POWER to BOTH, and we're going to make that a 1. The reason we're doing that is, again, to conserve power. There's no reason to drive the second FDAI before we get that information to put on it.
127:53:48|T|CMP|Okay. FDAI POWER to 1.
127:53:53|C|Mattingly|All right. That's correct. On page 2-2.
127:54:06|T|CMP|Go ahead.
127:54:07|C|Mattingly|Okay. Under CMC powerup, line - or step 2 says Flashing 3700, ENTER. The time we're going to use this, Jack, is going to be when you've just brought the computer up and it has a state vector in it that's way back many, many hours ago. So we want to do a VERB 96, ENTER to stop the integration to keep it from just sitting there ambling along. And when the ground gives you a new state vector, why then we can go through P00 and we'll be back in business.
127:54:43|T|CMP|Okay. You want me to go to VERB 37, ENTER; 00, ENTER; and then do VERB 96?
127:54:55|C|Mattingly|When you come up, I guess you're going to - once you get the CMC powered up, you're probably going to be going - you're going to come up in a flashing 37, and if you'll just do a VERB 96, ENTER right there, that will take care of it.
127:55:08|T|CMP|Okay.
127:55:09|C|Mattingly|All right. And the last one I have for you is on page 2-4.
127:55:23|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
127:55:24|C|Mattingly|Okay. Under the SCS powerup, the first line says AUTO RCS SELECT, 16, to OFF. Okay. You can just delete that part. On the fifth line, it says Circuit breaker SCS LOGIC POWER, that's really LOGIC BUS, four of them, to closed. The DELTA-V CG is not important since we are not burning the engine. The SIGNAL CONDITIONER/DRIVER BIAS POWER lists Two to AC 1. We are going to make that just one of them; make it SIGNAL CONDITION/DRIVER BIAS POWER, one, to AC 1. The BMAG POWER, which is the third line from the bottom, says BMAG POWER, two, ON; we are going to make that just one. We'll bring up number 1, and we'll make FDAI POWER, number 1 and the last line AUTO RCS SELECT, 16, enable, you can strike that off and replace it with BMAG MODE, three of them, to RATE 1. You want to try reading that back?
127:56:58|T|CMP|Okay. Delete AUTO RCS SELECT, 16, OFF. Change CB LOGIC POWER to LOGIC THRUST POWER - CBS CS LOGIC THRUST, four, to closed. Delete DELTA-V CG, coming down here SIGNAL CONDITIONER/DRIVER BIAS POWER, one, AC 1; BMAG POWER, one to ON, and it's the number 1 BMAG. FDAI POWER to 1; BMAG MODE, three, to RATE 1, deleting the AUTO RCS SELECT, 16, to enable.
127:57:34|C|Mattingly|That's correct. You've got them all, Jack. Very good. Thank you.
127:57:40|T|CMP|Thank you. This does it, huh?
127:57:43|C|Mattingly|Yes, sir. Let's see - just a second - let me check on this hatch and integrity check; maybe I can tell you something about that. And I do have an answer to your LM power question about the umbilicals. The umbilicals will be unpowered according to the LM procedures, so if you'd like to disconnect them, you can.
127:58:04|T|CMP|Okay. I think we will.
127:58:06|C|Mattingly|All right, sir. Okay, Jack, and they'd like us to stand by just a second.
127:58:19|C|Brand|Jack, would you get the BATTERY CHARGER, OFF, please. And we'll finish  -
127:58:24|T|CMP|Okay.
127:58:25|C|Brand|-  the rest of that procedure later.
127:58:26|T|CMP|You mean there's more? Okay, in work. BATTERY CHARGER is going OFF.
127:58:33|C|Brand|Right.
127:58:34|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. Okay - I don't think you've given me the backout procedure, have you, for the battery chargers?
127:58:43|C|Brand|That's negative. Wait. All we want to do, Jack, is say BATTERY CHARGE OFF at the moment. We'll complete that procedure as soon as you are through with Ken completely.
128:00:01|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. The BATTERY CHARGER's OFF, and I'm ready to continue with Ken.
128:00:06|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. And we'll get the backout to you after that.
128:00:13|C|Mattingly|Okay, Jack. It looks like we've closed up the loose ends here. Amazingly enough, out of all that stuff, it looks like we only generated one question on the floor, and we'll research that one. We'll even let you guess what it might have been. If you have any questions, after you mull it over, why, we're always available. Just ask us what you're thinking about.
128:00:40|T|CMP|Okay. That's what we're going to do. We're going to wait until the LM people get theirs, and then we're going to discuss it and coordinate things here, and make sure that - that we don't have any interface problems. And, if we have any more questions, we'll be coming back at you.
128:00:55|C|Mattingly|Okay. We did run the thing integrated, so we think we've got all the little surprises ironed out for you.
128:01:04|T|CMP|I hope so because tomorrow is examination time.
128:01:08|C|Mattingly|Roger.
128:01:09|T|CDR|Ken, this is Jim.
128:01:11|C|Mattingly|Yes, sir.
128:01:12|T|CDR|Appreciate the work you've done, and Jack says that it's going to be hard to beat his record about saving SM RCS fuel all the way there and back.
128:01:22|C|Mattingly|I can't do much about that.
128:01:25|C|Mattingly|Some people will do anything to set a record.
128:01:32|C|Stafford|Hey, Jim, you even did good on service module fuel this time.
128:01:40|T|CMP|Yes. We're coming back with full load almost of both RCS and SPS, that's - That's pretty much of a record.
128:01:56|T|CMP|Okay. Did you want to put Freddo on, or somebody to copy the LM - the LM side of the house.
128:02:08|C|Brand|Hey, Jack. Don't wake him up yet. Stand by 1.
128:02:13|T|CMP|He's - He's awake.
128:02:30|C|Brand|Hey, Jack. We'll give you this battery charging backout procedure, and then Deke says you ought to get some sleep. You're going to need it tomorrow.
128:02:44|T|CMP|Okay. I'm ready to copy the backout procedure.
128:02:47|C|Brand|Okay. Panel 3: BATTERY CHARGE, OFF - you've already done that, Jack - next AC INVERTOR, INVERTER 2 OFF: Panel 5: MAIN BUS TIE BAT B/C to BAT B/C. Huh? Yes, it's up - the up position. Panel 250: circuit breaker, BAT A POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING to open; circuit breaker, BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, open, Panel 5: CB BATTERY CHARGER BAT B CHARGE, open. Okay. I'll let, you read that back, Jack.
128:04:09|T|CMP|Okay. BAT CHARGE, OFF; AC INVERTER 2 to OFF; MAIN BUS TIE, BAT B/C to, on up. Panel 250: CB BAT A, POWER ENTRY AND POSTLAINDING, open. CB, BAT B, POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, open, panel 5: CB BAT CHARGER, BAT B CARDGE, open.
128:04:32|C|Brand|Okay. That's correct. Now, that gets you back to the place where you can back out of the - the big battery charging procedure, which you have. And I - I think you have the backout procedure for that, but I'd like to check with you.
128:05:00|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by here.
128:05:12|C|Brand|Okay, Jack. Do you have that backout procedure in your hand there?
128:05:20|T|CMP|Yes, I do, Vance.
128:05:22|C|Brand|Okay. Just to verify. It starts out panel 3, BATTERY CHARGE switch, OFF; AC INVERTER 2, OFF; panel 5, MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C, on, up, et cetera.
128:05:40|T|CMP|Roger. Continues CB BAT A, POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, open; INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, open; and then you reverse the steps that you had for entering the procedure.
128:05:54|C|Brand|Yes, that's fine. Okay. And we have one other comment regarding the systems checklist, and stand by 1, and that'll - that'll wrap it up for us. Oh, a new item came in, Jack. We need to switch to ascent water, and I have a three-step procedure for you, if you're ready to copy.
128:06:27|T|CMP|Okay. Jim will copy that.
128:06:32|C|Brand|Okay. DESCENT WATER valve, CLOSE. ASCENT WATER valve to CLOSE, and WATER TANK SELECT valve to ASCENT.
128:07:24|T|CDR|Okay, Vance. DESCENT WATER valve, closed; ASCENT WATER valve, closed; and WATER SELECT TANK to ASCENT. Is that correct?
128:07:34|C|Brand|WATER TANK SELECT valve, ASCENT. That's correct, Jim.
128:07:45|T|CDR|And we'll proceed with that right now, and how about still drinking descent water?
128:08:12|C|Brand|Jim, we understand that you should be able to continue drinking it.
128:08:24|T|CDR|Okay. We switched to ascent water, but we'll probably have to have the descent water valve back open up again to drink water.
128:08:34|C|Brand|That's affirm. That's the one thing you'll have to do is, whenever you want to drink out of the descent tank, is open the descent valve - the DESCENT WATER valve monentarily.
128:08:49|T|CDR|Okay. And we are now on ascent water.
128:08:53|C|Brand|Okay; okay. And I need Jack back again, please.
128:09:02|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. I'm here, and you have something in the systems checklist.
128:09:06|C|Brand|That's right. Refer to S/2-6. This - Really what we're talking about, Jack, is the hatch integrity check decal. And I think it'll be easiest, if you'll open to S/2-6 and I explain it to you.
128:09:41|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. I'm ready to copy.
128:09:44|C|Brand|Okay. This will - This just involves changes. Look down to the third line where it says TUNNEL VENT valve, TUNNEL VENT for 30 seconds; cross out 30 seconds and cross out the two lines below that. In other words, LM CSM DELTA-P. Check DELTA-P and recycle to TUNNEL VENT.
128:10:24|T|CMP|Okay. You want me to delete For 30 seconds.
128:10:34|C|Brand|That's affirm. And the two lines below "30 seconds. And actually the part of the fourth line there, which is 8-1/2 minutes.
128:10:50|T|CMP|Stand by. Can you read okay?
128:10:53|C|Brand|Yes. I hear you now.
128:10:55|T|CMP|Okay. Delete the two lines below that, or the two and a half lines below that, also.
128:11:02|C|Brand|That's affirm. And now we have an addition to put in place of what we deleted. Stand by 1; the COMM's bad. How do you read?
128:11:14|T|CMP|Roger. Loud and clear.
128:11:16|C|Brand|Okay. We want you to vent - tunnel vent until, and add the following, Until LM/CM DELTA-P is equal to 3.0 psid.
128:11:42|T|CMP|Okay. Until LM/CM DELTA-P equals 3.0.
128:11:47|C|Brand|Okay. And that means that you'll have a pressure of 1.5 to 2 in the tunnel, absolute. That's  -
128:11:57|T|CMP|Okay.
128:11:58|C|Brand|That's a note.
128:12:01|C|Slayton|Jack, that's what we want to end up with ultimately is 1-1/2 to 2 there on that tunnel and depending on the gage reading, but that should be about 3.
128:12:10|T|CMP|Okay, Deke.
128:12:12|C|Brand|Okay, then, Jack. Continuing on, everything's okay until you get down to - on the next page, you get through Verify O2 FLOW INDICATOR no increase. We would like to delete everything below that, until the last step, which is TUNNEL LIGHTS OFF. So starting with Before undocking only, delete all lines through TUNNEL VENT VALVE to TUNNEL VENT.
128:12:50|T|CMP|Okay. Delete the section that says Before undocking only down to where it says TUNNEL VENT VALVE to TUNNEL VENT.
128:12:57|C|Brand|Yes, through that.
128:13:00|T|CMP|Well, through that. Leave TUNNEL LIGHTS OFF is the only step remaining.
128:13:04|C|Brand|Roger. And just - That's a verify.
128:13:14|T|CMP|Okay. Got that.
128:13:15|C|Brand|Okay. Really what this does for you, then, is it gives you a pressure - a tunnel pressure integrity - or a hatch pressure integrity - integrity check with a DELTA-P of 3 psi between the tunnel and the cabin. And then you never go on to the steps of venting that on out. You just leave it in there for the time that you separate from the LM. And that gives you a shotgun DELTA-V effect.
128:13:52|T|CMP|Okay. Copy that.
128:13:54|C|Brand|Okay. I think that's all, but we're polling the house here to see if there's another comment for you. Stand by.
128:15:19|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
128:15:23|T|CMP|Go ahead, Vance.
128:15:24|C|Brand|Jack, that's it. Unless you have any more questions, why, everyone is hoping you'll hit the sack and get some rest.
128:15:34|T|CMP|Okay. You want that battery backout procedure now to take that - to complete the remaining steps?
128:15:50|C|Brand|That's affirm, Jack. We request that you go ahead and finish out the backout completely until you get to square 1. Over.
128:16:04|T|CMP|Okay.
128:16:24|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
128:16:26|C|Slayton|Go ahead, Jim.
128:16:29|T|CDR|Do you have any more updates for us?
128:16:32|C|Slayton|We've still got a LM update, but we strongly recommend that you and Jack work as hard as you can sleeping for about the next 5 hours. Fred can handle it.
128:16:42|T|CDR|Okay. That's what we'll do. We'll put Fred on watch here, and Jack and I will take it easy, and if Fred copies the LM update, well, then we'll all start from fresh in the morning.
128:16:56|C|Slayton|You bet.
128:23:44|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
128:23:48|T|LMP|All right, go ahead, Vance.
128:23:50|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. Two - three things. First thing is we need a docking angle check as soon as you can conveniently get it. Second point, you're free to drink all the descent stage water you want, if that wasn't clear before. And the third point, if you have a piece of paper, stand by to get writer's cramps. We have something to give you here.
128:24:21|T|LMP|Okay. You want the - again a look at the docking tunnel index?
128:24:27|C|Brand|Why don't you go ahead and look at that  -
128:24:28|T|LMP|... -
128:24:31|C|Brand|Look at that first, yes.
128:24:34|T|LMP|Okay.
128:24:43|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 128 hours -
128:25:46|T|LMP|Okay. Jim says the docking tunnel index is a plus 2.1 degrees.
128:25:52|C|Brand|Okay. Plus 2.1 degrees, docking tunnel index.
128:25:58|T|LMP|Okay. He corrects himself. He says make that sign a minus. Minus 2.1 degrees.
128:26:04|C|Brand|Okay. We just changed, plus to minus.
128:26:09|T|CMP|Okay. And your second item was, we can drink all that descent water that's left - look like about 5 percent, and I'll get book here and be ready to start writing.
128:26:23|C|Brand|Okay. Get - This won't be as long as - as the one T. K. read up, but you'll need several pages, probably.
128:26:35|T|LMP|Okay. I've got lots of pages here of Ken's photo log set to go.
128:26:41|C|Brand|Okay, Freddo. Okay. This is Entry, LM PREP. Starts EI minus 6 hours. At that time, you power up the AGS. I think I'll give you a line at a time and, when I hear you say okay on that, I'll go to the next. That sound reasonable?
128:27:11|T|LMP|Okay. I'll go hot mike briefly.
128:27:16|C|Brand|Okay. BAT 5  -
128:27:25|T|LMP|Hey, how do you read now?
128:27:27|C|Brand|Okay. I read you okay, Fred. Okay. Battery 5  -
128:27:33|T|LMP|Okay entry.
128:27:37|C|Brand|Battery 5 NORMAL FEED ON is the first step.
128:27:50|T|LMP|Okay, Vance. - Go ahead.
128:27:53|C|Brand|Okay. Use modified LM DPS/RCS 30-minute activation checklist.
128:28:22|T|LMP|Okay.
128:28:25|C|Brand|EI minus 5 hours. Midcourse-7, if required. Next: LM preentry procedure. And, Fred, the time on LM preentry procedure is just  -
128:28:59|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
128:29:00|C|Brand|Okay. The time on the LM preentry procedure is just as soon as you finish midcourse-7, or 5 hours  -
128:29:08|T|LMP|All right, go ahead, Vance.
128:29:09|C|Brand|Okay.
128:29:10|T|LMP|Okay. I've got this TEI minus 5 hours, MCC-7 if required, and now you're going to start me a new procedure called LM preentry procedure. Go ahead.
128:29:19|C|Brand|Roger. Maneuver to SM SEP attitude. Configure for CSM hotfire.
128:29:44|T|LMP|Okay.
128:29:46|C|Brand|Under that, DEADBAND, MAX; and ATTITUDE CONTROL, three, to PULSE.
128:30:04|T|LMP|Okay.
128:30:05|C|Brand|Perform CSM hotfire. Maneuver back to SM SEP attitude.
128:30:22|T|LMP|Okay.
128:30:25|C|Brand|And under that, ATTITUDE CONTROL, PITCH and ROLL, PULSE; YAW, MODE CONTROL.
128:30:51|C|Brand|Okay. Next, EI minus 4 hours, 30 minutes. Configure for CM/SM SEP.
128:31:02|T|LMP|Okay. Hold on a minute.
128:31:03|C|Brand|Okay.
128:31:04|T|LMP|That was EI - EI minus 4-1/2?
128:31:07|C|Brand|That's correct.
128:31:26|T|LMP|Okay. That's EI minus 4-1/2 hours, configure for SM SEP.

129:08:41|C|Brand|Go ahead, Jim.
129:08:43|T|CDR|Have we looked seriously now at just the essential things required to make a safe LM jettison? We're not - I don't think we have the time to really do any engineering data that people might want to look at as this thing goes into the atmosphere.
129:09:06|C|Brand|Well, Jim. I - I think that that was what everybody aimed for, and people down here feel that it's the essentials, that it's what you need.
129:09:19|T|CDR|Well, we'll do everything you think essential, but I just don't want to be throwing switches at the last minute. What we're really thinking about, getting that command module in good shape.
129:09:35|C|Stafford|Hey, Jim. This is Tom. The only reason we're bringing up the PGNS is to have another reference system just to control the LM when you jettison the thing. Over.
129:09:45|T|CDR|Okay. Okay, Tom. It's - I thought the - an AGS ATT HOLD would have been sufficient for this, when we first thought about this.
129:09:53|C|Stafford|Yes. I agree. But we decided just in case we have any glitch with the AGS, we want to make sure we get that LM off in a good shape. And I agree with you on keeping out all the garbage on it.
129:10:03|T|CDR|Okay, Tom.
129:10:05|C|Slayton|Hey, would you like to have  -
129:10:06|T|CDR|Good night.

129:13:28|C|Brand|Roger. And this activates your upfiring jets.
129:13:35|T|LMP|Say the last again, Vance.
129:13:36|C|Brand|Roger. What this does, Fred, is activate upfiring jets.
129:13:41|T|LMP|Oh, okay.
129:13:43|C|Brand|They're all - actually, all vertical jets.
129:14:00|T|LMP|Okay. I got it.
129:14:01|C|Brand|Next, the same page, under DAP set gimbal drive, go to step 2. Okay. Add in after NOUN 46, 32021.
129:14:31|T|LMP|Okay. 32021.
129:14:35|C|Brand|Okay. Proceeding on down below the NOUN 47, to the PROCEED, insert VERB 34, ENTER, after the PROCEED. And that would come before the NOUN 48.
129:14:59|T|LMP|Okay, you PRO and then do a VERB 34.
129:15:13|C|Brand|Roger. Okay. We have some noise here, Fred. Stand by a minute.
129:15:29|T|LMP|I switched OMNIs. How's that?
129:15:31|C|Brand|Hey, that helped. Okay. No changes now on 29, 30, and 31. Next page is 32.
129:15:45|T|LMP|Okay. I'm on 32.
129:15:48|C|Brand|Okay. At the very first step above GUIDANCE CONTROL, AGS, put in VERB 76, ENTER.
129:16:02|T|LMP|Okay. VERB 76, ENTER.
129:16:05|C|Brand|Okay. Below GUIDANCE CONTROL, AGS, the third step should be changed to be MODE CONTROL, both, to ATT HOLD.
129:16:18|T|LMP|Okay. You want MODE CONTROL, both, to ATT HOLD.
129:16:21|C|Brand|That's affirm.
129:16:31|T|LMP|Okay.
129:16:32|C|Brand|Okay. At minus 6 - 6 hours - or 6 minutes rather, under MODE CONTROL, PGNS, ATT HOLD, which was scratched out, insert VERB 41 NOUN 20, ENTER, and three more ENTERs. So - So it's as shown in your procedure there.
129:17:13|T|LMP|Yes.
129:17:14|C|Brand|Okay  -
129:17:15|T|LMP|Coarse aline 000.
129:17:17|C|Brand|Below that, put in DEDA, 400 plus 5.
129:17:35|T|LMP|Okay. DEDA, 400 plus 5.
129:17:38|C|Brand|Okay. Okay. We want back in again the next step which is At burn attitude: VERB 40 NOUN 20, ENTER.
129:17:56|T|LMP|Okay.
129:18:08|C|Brand|Okay. Proceeding on down, delete At burn attitude and the step above it, which is 400 plus 5.
129:18:24|T|LMP|400 plus 5 and the at burn attitude.
129:18:28|C|Brand|Correct.
129:18:39|C|Brand|Okay. That's all for page 32, Fred. Next, page 33.
129:18:46|T|LMP|Go ahead.
129:18:49|C|Brand|Okay. Under 4 minutes, minus 4 minutes, add back in MODE CONTROL, both, to ATT HOLD.
129:19:10|T|LMP|Okay. MODE CONTROL, both, to ATT HOLD.
129:19:15|C|Brand|Okay. Two steps below that, add back in TTCA COMMANDER THROTTLE MIN DPS, and add in DPS.
129:19:36|T|LMP|Wait a minute.
129:19:39|C|Brand|Stand by 1.
129:19:41|T|LMP|TTC - Yes. Seems like you should be in JETS, since this is going to be - is this going to be RCS or a DPS burn?
129:19:49|C|Brand|Okay. This will be JETS for RCS and THROTTLE for DPS.
129:20:00|T|LMP|What I don't understand is, what is this MCC likely to be? I thought it was going to be an RCS.
129:20:05|C|Brand|Well, we - We expect that, but we're remaining flexible.
129:20:11|T|LMP|(Laughter) Okay. Okay. I'll put in TTCA THROTTLE MIN for DPS, JETS for RCS.
129:20:18|C|Brand|That's correct. Okay. That'w all on the page 33. Go to page 34.
129:20:36|T|LMP|Okay; 34.
129:20:39|C|Brand|Okay. Beneath everything on that page, add in the following. Return to Entry, - LM PREP check - return to Entry, LM PREP checklist  -
129:21:00|T|LMP|Hold on, Vance; I don't understand. We want to delete everything on page 34?
129:21:07|C|Brand|No, that's not correct, Fred. What we want to do is leave everything the way it is on 34, and add this one comment I'm giving you at the - at the bottom of it.
129:21:17|T|LMP|Oh, okay. Okay. I misunderstood. Okay. Go ahead with your added comment.
129:21:22|C|Brand|Return to Entry LM PREP checklist.
129:21:35|C|Brand|Add EI  -
129:21:36|T|LMP|... turn to - return to Entry, LM checklist?
129:21:43|C|Brand|That's affirm. At EI minus 5 hours.
129:21:48|T|LMP|Okay. At EI minus 5 hours. Let me take a look and see how that flows, now.
129:22:00|C|Brand|Okay. And also you have a  -
129:22:02|T|LMP|Okay. That would be the LM - the LM preentry procedure. Yes. Okay.
129:22:08|C|Brand|That's correct, and, also on that page, you - from our last correct - or addition exercise, you have a section called "Reestablish PTC." We'd like to scratch all of that, of course.
129:22:22|T|LMP|Roger.
129:22:46|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. That's all except for one comment that we have, and - Just a second.
129:25:09|C|Brand|Stand by 1. Fred, we're polling the room for comments here, any last minute thoughts from people. We'll be right back with you.
129:25:18|T|LMP|Okay.
129:28:11|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
129:28:17|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
129:28:19|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. Just two changes, comments to what we just gave you. The first is near the front at EI - in the section under EI minus 2-1/2 hours, power removal from CM LM umbilical. We'll let you turn to that.
129:28:44|T|LMP|Okay, I'm there at EI minus 2-1/2 hours, power removal CM LM umbilicaL.
129:28:49|C|Brand|Okay. Under LM, we have a step, BAT 2, LOW VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET, than ON. Next we have a step BAT 2, HI VOLTAGE. OFF/RESET, then ON. We request that you wait in between these two steps for us to give you a GO. In other words, we'd like to look and see that all the relays closed and all that sort of thing before you throw BAT 2, HI VOLTACE, to OFF/RESET, and ON.
129:29:33|T|LMP|Okay, After BAT 2, LOW VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET, I'll - then ON, I'll wait for a MSFN GO before proceeding.
129:29:42|C|Brand|Right-o. Okay. Next, at - Under the section of EI minus 1 hour and 45 minutes - No, change that. Correction, EI minus 1 hour, 35 minutes, refer to the ECS section, and we have a change.
129:30:13|T|LMP|All right. Go ahead, Vance.
129:30:17|C|Brand|Okay, Jim's right. We should cross out all this stuff with a couple of exceptions. FORWARD DUMP valve, closed, the first step, should remain. All other steps should be scratched, except for the last one, which is OVERHEAD DUMP valve, closed. That leaves two steps.
129:30:45|T|LMP|Okay. Under ECS, we delete all except the first step, FORWARD DUMP valve, close, and step 10, which is OVERHEAD DUMP valve, closed, and leave in verify transfer list.
129:31:06|C|Brand|That's affirm. Leave in what follows, which is verify transfer list and IVT and all that.
129:31:28|C|Brand|IVT, of course, meaning CDR transferring to the CM.
129:31:38|T|LMP|We wouldn't forget it.
129:31:43|C|Brand|Okay, Freddo. That's - That's the changes. Not quite as extensive as the CSM had, but still pretty long. Any comments or questions to the house here?
129:32:02|T|LMP|No, it looks pretty good to me, Vance.
129:32:06|C|Brand|Okay. Very good. Only other comment, aside from the checklist, we've been watching your descent stage water, and it looks - or your ascent stage water, and it looks real good.
129:32:22|T|LMP|Okay.
129:32:42|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. We're going to try to refrain from calling you from now on, so that you can maybe get a couple of winks. We're getting a status around the room first, to see if anybody has any comments for you and, after that, we'll try to leave you alone for awhile.
129:33:06|T|LMP|Thank you.
129:37:36|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
129:38:00|C|Brand|Aquarius, Houston.
129:38:25|C|Brand|Hey, Freddo. Are you there?
129:38:29|T|LMP|All right, go ahead.
129:38:30|C|Brand|Okay. We polled the room. We don't have much for you. Only comments as follows: your consumables are looking good; your entry gamma right now is minus 6.01. We're expecting a midcourse of 2.81 foot per second which should be about 21 seconds of RCS.
129:38:56|T|LMP|Okay. It sounds good.
129:38:58|C|Brand|Okay, Fred. See you in the morning.
129:39:01|T|LMP|Roger.
129:40:14|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Request you open the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker and DOWN VOICE BACKUP, please.
129:40:30|T|CDR|Complete.
129:40:32|C|Lousma|Roger.
129:42:46|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 129 hours 43 minutes. Recounting events since the change of shift about 3 hours ago. We've completed passing up to the crew checklists for both the Command and Service Module and the Lunar Module - entry checklist, at about 128 hours 30 minutes, we had the crew switch over from the descent water tanks which were down to about 5 percent to the LM ascent stage water tank for cooling. We instructed the crew that they could drink all the water from the descent tank. At about 127 hours, 59 minutes, the battery charging was terminated. This had been accomplished by using power from the LM batteries and using that to charge the Command Module entry batteries two of the three CM entry batteries. At the present time, Fred Haise is on watch, and Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert are scheduled for about 5 hours rest. We're also planning to place a minimum of calls to the spacecraft to allow Fred Haise to get a bit of rest also, at this time. Flight Dynamics Officer, and the Retro Officer - the Return to Earth Officer have currently predicted that our entry interface angle will be minus 6.03 degrees without a mid-course correction. We're presently planning for a mid-course correction - Mid-course correction 7 which would be 5 hours prior to entry interface. And as it looks right now, this mid-course correction would be quite small to put us on the desired flight path angle of about 6 1/2 degrees - negative 6 1/2 degrees interface angle. To accomplish this, it looks as if we'll have about a 2.8 second - 2.8 foot per second burn with the Lunar Module reaction control system thrusters. This would require about about 21 seconds of thrusting. During the course of the evening, both Deke Slayton and Tom Stafford have been standing by the CAPCOM console. Occasionally interjecting a comment. At one point, while Fred Haise was receiving a Lunar Module entry checklist, with a hot mike, with his mike open, we heard a comment from Lovell which prompted a remark from Deke Slayton to the effect that he would play up some guitar music if they thought that would soothe Lovell into getting a bit of rest. Ken Mattingly has also been here a good part of the evening. We don't see him at the console at this time. Our Capsule Communicator up until just a few minutes ago was Astronaut Vance Brand and he has since turned over those duties to Astronaut Jack Lousma. 
129:46:10|P|PAO|At 129 hours 46 minutes, Apollo 13 is 87,684 nautical miles - correction 74,900 nautical miles from the Earth, and travelling at a speed of 6,999 feet per second. All of the consumables aboard the LM remain in good shape at this time. We had Fred Haise remove the LM power amplifier and in effect reduce the effective power output - radio frequency power output from the LM from about 20 watts to about 1 watt, which is the normal powered down configuration we've been in with the LM for communications. We expect it will as it has in the past give us periods of noisy communications as the LM antennas rotate through the so-called null areas. Where the signal to noise ratio drops off - we get a high noise level and this will persist until the spacecraft rotates through to where we have good lockup on the LM antenna, and again at 129 hours 47 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
130:36:16|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 130 hours 36 minutes. The Flight Dynamics Officer just reported that continued tracking data shows the spacecraft to be within the entry corridor still at about the same entry interface angle as previously reported. The tracking at this time shows that our entry interface angle remains at about minus 6.03 degrees. The midcourse correction plan for 5 hours prior to reentry which will be about 7 hours 3 minutes from now. It is planned at this time to be 2.81 feet per second. That would be about a 21 second burn with the spacecraft, the LM reaction control system thrusters. In about an hour, Flight Director Milton Windler plans to go over once again with the flight controllers all of the step by step procedures which the crew will be following tomorrow prior to entry while with the command and service module.
130:37:24|P|PAO|At the present time Apollo 13 is 71,483 nautical miles from the Earth. Traveling at a speed of 7,192 feet per second. All of our consumables on the LM remain unchanged. We're in good shape on water, battery power, and lithium hydroxide. The present level of carbon dioxide as measured in the spacecraft telemetered back to the ground is about 4 tenth of a millimeter of mercury which is very good. We're showing a total average current on the LM, at this time, of between 10 and 12 amps, which has been the normal amount we've been running in the powered down mode with the lunar module. At the present time, all 3 of the astronauts are apparently resting. Astronauts Lovell and Swigert were to have begun a rest period at about 128 hours 17 minutes. We did hear once or twice Jim Lovell after that period. At the 129 hours 39 minutes or about 1 hours ago, we completed passing the lunar module a preentry checklist up to Fred Haise and advised him that we would keep communications to a minimum, and hoped he would be able to get a little rest also. At 130 hours 39 minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.
131:14:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 131 hours 14 minutes. Our last conversation with the spacecraft came at about 129 hours 39 minutes, a little more than an hour and a half ago. Since that time it's been relatively quiet here in Mission Control. Within the next hour, flight director Milton Windler plans for review again the procedures to be followed during the reentry with each of the flight controllers. These entry procedures were passed up to the crew, prior to the time they began their rest period. At this time we presume that all three crewmen aboard the spacecraft are resting. At the present time we show Apollo 13 to be 68,857 nautical miles from the Earth. The velocity increase now up to 7,346 feet per second and increasing ever more rapidly as the spacecraft nears Earth. We're now 6 hours 25 minutes from the scheduled midcourse correction which will put Apollo 13 in the center of the entry corridor. And we're 11 hours 25 minutes from the beginning of reentry. At 131 hours 16 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.
131:46:49|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 131 hours 47 minutes. Apollo 13 now 66,596 nautical miles from the Earth travelling at a speed of almost 7,500 feet per second at the present time, and we're some 10 hours 53 minutes from reentry. 5 hours 53 minutes from the scheduled mid-course correction maneuver, mid-course correction 7, which is targeted to put Apollo 13 in the center of the reentry corridor. Our last communications with the spacecraft was at 129 hours 39 minutes when we completed passing up the Lunar Module preentry checklist to Fred Haise, and we presume that all three of the crewmen have been resting or at least relaxing since that time. At 128 hours 17 minutes or about 3 1/2 hours ago Fred Haise and - rather Jack Swigert and Jim Lovell were scheduled to begin a rest period. Although, we did hear from Jim Lovell once or twice, after that time, we have not heard from Jack Swigert since the rest period began. At 131 hours 49 minutes, this is Mission Control standing by.
132:28:39|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 132 hours 29 minutes.
132:28:45|C|Lousma|Fred, are you sleeping.
132:28:54|T|LMP|Go ahead.
132:28:59|C|Lousma|Fred, in a couple of minutes we're going to hand over the Honeysuckle, so there'll be - Our uplink will be terminated. We'll contact you when we get it back.
132:29:15|T|LMP|Okay.
132:29:35|C|Lousma|After that, I've got a couple minutes of work for you.
132:29:45|T|LMP|All right. Go ahead.
132:29:51|C|Lousma|Let's wait until after the handover.
132:30:21|T|LMP|Are you there, Jack?
132:30:23|C|Lousma|Yes, I'm hearing you loud and clear. How me, Fred?
132:30:28|T|LMP|...
132:30:30|C|Lousma|Okay. We want to get some ranging data on you for about 15 minutes. So close the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker and go to NORMAL VOICE, please.
132:30:40|T|LMP|Okay.
132:31:02|T|LMP|Okay. You ought to have it now, Jack.
132:31:09|C|Lousma|Okay. You're coming through good now, Fred. I've got three DELTAs to the checklist. They're minor changes. I'd like to pass them along now. One of them is to the CSM checklist. So if you'll pick that up, I'll give it to you.
132:31:25|T|LMP|Okay. Which one?
132:31:29|C|Lousma|Okay. Stand by 1.
132:31:33|T|LMP|Is it the one Jack wrote them all in? The big long readout? He also wrote something in the G&N book.
132:31:41|C|Lousma|It's in the big, long one he wrote out at about EI minus 02:30. EMS entry check.
132:31:51|T|LMP|Okay. He's coming back down with it.
132:32:37|C|Lousma|Meanwhile, Fred, I've got two for you on the LM PREP checklist.
132:32:44|T|LMP|Okay. Jack's here now. I'll hand it to him.
132:33:28|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
132:33:32|C|Lousma|Hello, Aquarius. I've got a couple of changes for you on your CSM checklist.
132:33:44|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by 1.
132:33:56|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
132:34:00|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. The time line between EI minus 02:30 and 1 hour is real crowded, so you're really going to have to hustle, and we've decided to delete the EMS entry check at minus 02:30. That'll give you a little more time in there. What we've decided to do with it is wait until after EI minus 1, just before you initialize the EMS. If you have time, and only if you have time, do the EMS entry check. Otherwise, forget it and go right on into EMS initialization. You understand?
132:34:49|T|CMP|Okay. You're going to delete - between 2 hours and 30 minutes and 02:15 there, and you're going to add it, if there is time, only if there is time, at EI minus 1 hour where the EMS initialization occurs.
132:35:11|C|Lousma|That's right. You got it correctly. Okay, Jack. One other item. Just before EI minus 2 hours and 15 minutes, we need an E-memory dump VERB 74 ENTER. Over.
132:35:40|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by 1, would you, please?
132:36:24|T|CMP|Okay. Right before 2 hours and 15 minutes, I assume that's before MSFN gives their P27 update, I do a VERB 74. Right?
132:36:34|C|Lousma|That's affirmative, Jack.
132:36:54|C|Lousma|How much sleep did you get, Jack?
132:37:01|T|CMP|Oh, I guess - Stand by. I guess maybe 2 or 3 hours. It was awful cold, and it wasn't very good sleep.
132:37:15|C|Lousma|Roger. You plan to try to get any more?
132:37:20|T|CMP|What GET do you have?
132:37:24|C|Lousma|We got 132:37.
132:37:40|T|CMP|Well, if I - If I get everything done, I'll try, but I tell you, it's almost impossible to sleep.
132:37:59|T|CMP|All of us have that same problem. It's just too cold to sleep.
132:38:07|C|Lousma|Roger. The way we're looking at it, looks like you ought to have a couple free hours here before you have to really get with it.
132:38:19|T|CMP|We'll - we'll take it easy, but I - and we'll try to sleep, but it's just awful cold.
132:38:33|C|Lousma|Present data indicates that your entry angle is minus 6.03 degrees. Your DELTA-V at the midcourse is going to 2.8 feet a second.
132:38:45|T|CMP|Okay. Copy.
132:38:54|T|CDR|Jack, this is. Jim. I understand this is going to be an RSC burn.
132:39:01|C|Lousma|That's afirmative, Jim. It's going to be an RCS burn.
132:39:05|T|CDR|Okay.
132:39:10|C|Lousma|And we need the SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF valve back to AUTO. Correction, back to CLOSE.
132:39:24|T|CMP|Hey, Jack, that's in work. And one thing, comparing Jim's checklist with my own, I find one difference there at EI minus 02:30. His checklist has me changing a - opening a EPS SENSOR SIGNAL circuit breaker right prior to turning off LM power. Is - I'd like to find out which checklist is correct.
132:41:05|C|Young|Hey, Jack. The LM checklist is just for information to Jim. It's just to tell him that - that you're changing back to command module power. Your checklist is correct. Over.
132:41:20|T|CMP|Okay. And when do you figure that you'll be sending up the PADs that you have?
132:44:02|C|Lousma|Aquarius, all of your PADs will be coming up in about 3-1/2 hours, at EI minus 06:30. And one thing we want to remind you of, when you remove power from the command module LM umbilical, is to be sure that you open the LM POWER MAIN B circuit breakers, both of them, before you start throwing switches and circuit breakers in the LM. Do it as we've outlined it in the procedure, in that order. Over.
132:44:33|T|LMP|Okay. That's the way we planned on it. We'll let Jack do his three and then he'll tell us when we're GO from there. What pages are those changes on?
132:44:48|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. The one I've got for you is at the end of power removal from the command module LM umbilical. And just for your information, after you go through that entire procedure and about the time you're ready to transfer to the command module, at that time, power will be removed from the umbilical, and it's okay to disconnect it. That is, after you've thrown the switches in the LM. Is that clear?
132:45:21|T|LMP|Roger. That's where I've got a remark here to check with you to see if it's all right to proceed.
132:45:28|C|Lousma|Roger. And that would be just after, on panel 16, you opening ASCENT ECA CONTROL breakers.
132:45:42|T|LMP|Which step number is that?
132:46:03|T|LMP|The confusing thing is, Jack, where they told me to wait for MSFN GO before proceeding was that BAT 2 LOW VOLTS OFF/RESET, then ON.
132:46:12|C|Lousma|Okay. That's still affirmative. We'll give you a go after waiting 5 seconds, and then down from there just a few steps, after you have opened the ASCENT ECA CONTROL breakers on panel 16, at that point, the umbilical is not powered, and it's okay to disconnect them should you care to do so.
132:46:35|T|LMP|Okay. After the last step then, I'm free to disconnect.
132:46:39|C|Lousma|Right. And one other change we have is, shortly after that, where we're configuring for jettison, we have closed both the FORWARD DUMP valve and the OVERHEAD DUMP valve. And we don't want to get in a locked up position like that, so one way to get around it is to - After we close the FORWARD DUMP valve, turn the DESCENT OXYGEN valve off. Over.
132:47:17|T|LMP|Okay. After the FORWARD DUMP valve, add a step in that says the DESCENT OX valve, off.
132:47:31|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. That concludes the DELTAs. And perhaps you heard that our GAMMAs are still minus 6.03 and our DELTA-V will be a 2.8 foot per second RCS burn.
132:47:46|T|LMP|Roger.
132:48:23|C|Lousma|Freddo, we've got one more change we'd like to give you to clarify a question that Jack asked earlier. At EI minus 02:30  -
132:48:35|T|LMP|Okay. Hold on a minute, Jack. I meant to call Jack back down. I'm not familiar with the previous discussion.
132:48:42|C|Lousma|Negative. This is on your checklist.
132:48:47|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
132:48:49|C|Lousma|At E mi - EI minus 02:30, during power removal from the umbilical, first thing we do is two steps with the CSM. We open the MAIN B, the LM POWER to MAIN B circuit breakers, and then there's a third step which says "Circuit breaker EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, open." Just delete that step. Over.
132:49:18|T|LMP|Okay. Delete the third step.
132:50:38|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, for your information, as far as our water supply is concerned, including our plans for powerup, we have an additional 18 hours of water remaining from this point.
132:51:01|T|LMP|Okay. Eighteen hours of water remaining from this point, Jack.
132:51:26|T|CDR|Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
132:51:29|C|Lousma|Hello, Aquarius. Go ahead.
132:51:32|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. This is Jim. I just want to make sure that you're filtering the changes to the checklist that come up to make sure that they're absolutely essential. When we learn our procedures, we can only do it one time, and we can't make changes at the last minute. We'd like to do the best, the safest way possible, but unless the changes are really essential, don't bother sending them up.
132:51:57|C|Lousma|Roger. We won't. The chairman of the CPCB is still active, and one thing we're trying to do is to save you all the time we can between EI minus 02:30 and 1 hour.
132:52:10|T|CDR|That's affirm. That's a real important time.
132:52:14|C|Slayton|Yes. For your information, Jim, I don't know whether you heard that originally, but that time from 2-1/2 to 1 in there has been run about three times, and it's pretty tight, so we've tried to weed out what we could, which isn't much, but I think the other message you might impress on Jack when you get around to aligning that platform, don't try to get it down too neat. It doesn't have to be all that good. Just do a nice quick and dirty one, and that's going to be good enough anyway.
132:52:43|T|CDR|I concur. I think for reentry we don't have to have a real accurate platform, but I have to tell Jack that.
132:52:50|C|Slayton|Roger. Hey, Jim, while you're up and things are nice and quiet, let me give you a couple of other things to think about. One specifically. I know none of you are sleeping worth a damn because it's so cold, and you might want to dig out the medical kit there around 01:35 or in that ballpark, and pull out a couple of Dexedrines apiece and try one about then, and another around 01:39 to 01:40.
132:53:15|T|CDR|Well, I hadn't brought that up. We might - We might consider it
132:53:17|C|Slayton|Okay.
132:53:30|P|PAO|That was Donald K. Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations interjecting some comments to the crew from a CAPCOM console. Also -
132:53:39|C|Slayton|Wish we could figure a way to get a hot cup of coffee up to you. It'd probably taste pretty good about now, wouldn't it?
132:53:46|T|CDR|Yes, it sure would. You don't realize how cold this thing becomes when it's in a PTC mode that's slowing down, and I just clocked the cycles on my ... And it's about 11 to 12 minutes now, and the Sun is directly overhead, so it's shining on the engine bell of the service module and not getting down to the spacecraft at all.
132:54:16|C|Lousma|Hang in there. It won't be long now.
132:54:19|T|CDR|Yes. That's right. As a matter of fact, doing this alignment on the Earth this time will be like making a landing with a fogged-up windshield.
133:11:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 133 hours 11 minutes. At 132 hours 28 minutes CAPCOM Jack Lousma put in a call to the crew. Fred Haise responded and we had him turn on the power amplifier which addition to greatly improving the quality of voice communications we get, also gives us ranging data which the Flight Dynamics Officer's using for making final computations of the midcourse correction to be performed in about 4 and a half hours. Jack Swigert reported that he received - gotten about 2 to 3 hours sleep which he said was not very good sleep due to the cold in the command module. Swigert said it is almost impossible to sleep because of the cold and Donald K. Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations, and who has been at the CAPCOM console a good part of the evening and into this morning, came on the circuit and advised Jim Lovell to consider taking Dexedrine tablets for each of the crewmen. This is a stimulant contained in the medical kit. Lovell said that they had considered that and would think about it.
133:13:01|P|PAO|At the present time Apollo 13 is 60,249 nautical miles from the Earth. The spacecraft velocity is up to 7,900 feet per second and we're some 9 hours 27 minutes until reentry. We'll continue to stand by for any further communications with the crew. We don't have any plan to pass up to them in the next few minutes or so. One of the things under discussion, however, at the present time in Mission Control are procedures which might possibly be used to increase the temperature in the Lunar Module and the LM environmental and electrical systems engineer's looking into the power status right now. As far as consumables are concerned, with the possibility in mind that perhaps bringing some additional equipment on line in the LM to bring the temperature up there.
133:14:47|P|PAO|We're presently showing the cabin temperature in the lunar module at about 54 degrees, and we although do not have a measurement on the command module we presume that it is lower than that, and we'll continue to keep you advised on the status of the discussion going on at present in Mission Control on the advisability of powering up the LM more fully to bring up the temperature.
133:21:53|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston.
133:22:06|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
133:22:08|C|Lousma|Okay, Skipper. We figured out a way for you to keep warm. We decided to start powering you up now, and what we want you to do - what we want you to do is take your entry LM PREP checklist and start at the top where it says "BAT 5 NORMAL FEED on," and then jump over as it says to your 30-minute activation, and do all of the 30-minute activation up to, but not including, the burn. You copy?
133:22:52|T|CDR|Okay. If I understand you correctly, then that gives me leeway to maneuver when we get up to activation complete, and we can be in position for the burn, but we will not burn. We don't have a PAD anyway.
133:23:15|C|Lousma|That's affirm, Jim. You could maneuver to burn attitude, or you could maneuver to an attitude which should put the Sun in the windows to warm the place up.
133:23:23|T|CDR|Sounds good, and you're sure we have plenty of electrical power to do this?
133:23:29|C|Lousma|That's affirmative. We've got plenty of power to do it. I can get you a number, though.
133:23:37|C|Slayton|Jim, you've got about 100-percent margins on everything from here on in.
133:23:45|T|CDR|That sounds encouraging.
133:23:46|C|Slayton|Roger. That's in the LM. We're not talking about the CSM right now.
133:23:52|T|CDR|I understand.
133:30:36|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
133:30:39|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
133:30:43|T|LMP|Okay. Question. This short turn on step 3 on page 24 has us only turning on the RCS SYSTEM A/B, two quads, and the breakers are still out on panel 11. Did you want those in, too, or are we just going to use one set of heaters?
133:31:02|C|Lousma|Stand by.
133:31:32|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. Go as the checklist recommends for now. When you get into the circuit breaker panel configuration, you're going to get the number 1 set of heaters on anyway.
133:31:44|T|LMP|Okay.
133:33:57|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 133 hours, 34 minutes. We're following the progress of the crew as they power up the lunar module, according to the checklist, and at the present time we show the total average current -
133:34:14|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. We'd like to get a hack to set our mission timer here, Jack.
133:34:21|C|Lousma|Okay, Freddo. Set it at 133:35 straight up. You've got about 30 seconds to set it.
133:34:49|T|LMP|Okay. Standing by.
133:34:52|C|Lousma|Okay. I'll give you the 2-second delay in there. Stand by to start.
133:34:59|C|Lousma|START.
133:35:03|T|LMP|Okay. We've got it.
133:35:05|C|Lousma|Okay. I'm counting 133:35:10.
133:35:11|T|LMP|Right on.
133:35:25|P|PAO|We're showing about 34-35 amps total current now.
133:35:41|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. One other way to warm things up in a hurry in there is when you get your AC on to turn on the window heaters.
133:35:58|T|LMP|Okay. I guess the only question I have is what it's liable to do to us with the - looks like almost a frost on it now.
133:36:25|T|LMP|Understand this, Jack. I'd like to let it maybe warm up just a little bit more before hitting it with the heat load.
133:36:33|C|Lousma|Not a bad idea.
133:38:26|T|LMP|And, as you can see, Houston, at turnon we got our old friend downlink too fast.
133:38:37|C|Lousma|Roger. We're seeing it, Fred.
133:41:08|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. It looks like you're proceeding toward the gimbal lock there. We'd like you to check that, please.
133:41:20|T|CDR|Roger. Not much we can do about it. We can't use the thrusters, Houston.
133:41:32|C|Lousma|Okay. Forget it now; we'll get it later.
133:44:44|T|LMP|And, Houston, Aquarius. I guess the next thing for the PGNS will be a coarse align 000, but I guess we ought to hold up now until we get enough time on the RCS thrusters.
133:44:57|C|Lousma|Roger. We're looking at them. We'll give you the GO on them. Okay, Aquarius. Your quads are 120 to 133 now, so you're cleared for - Cleared for thrusters.
133:47:48|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston.
133:47:52|T|CDR|Go ahead.
133:47:53|C|Lousma|Roger. Did you get my GO for RCS?
133:47:56|T|CDR|That's affirm. We're GO. What we're doing now, Jack, is letting the spacecraft drift in this mode to pick up the Earth again.
133:48:05|C|Lousma|Okay.
133:48:07|T|CDR|I don't want to just go blasting around the sky and get high rates, because I don't have anything to null the rates on until the Earth comes back up again. And - Once I get the Earth in sight, we have no strain on nulling rates. That's finding the Earth, that is.
133:53:50|T|CDR|It's going to be interesting today, Jack. The Earth's a lot bigger; the crescent is a lot more pronounced than it was yesterday.
133:54:04|C|Lousma|Well, you're going in the right direction.
133:54:10|T|CDR|That's right.
133:54:29|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 133 hour, 55 minutes. Jim Lovell has stabilized the spacecraft at this point using the LM reaction control system thrusters. We're showing a power level on the lunar module right now ranging between 45 and 50 amps. The power up procedure followed by the crew will have another effect in addition to warming up the LM, and that is they're beginning a portion of the preentry checklist that had been scheduled for 6 hours prior to entry interface, and that was begun at about 9 hours. So, they'll be getting a bit of a leg up on that portion of the time line. At the present time Apollo 13 is -
133:55:27|T|LMP|And, Jack, I guess we haven't changed our angle much with respect to the Sun 93 million miles away, so it ought to be in about the same place in the AOT, isn't that Charlie?
133:55:50|C|Lousma|Hold 1 on that, Fred. I'll get an answer for you.
133:55:54|T|LMP|Okay.
133:57:20|C|Lousma|Aquarius, your ASA is warmed up now. You can activate the AGS.
133:57:26|T|LMP|Okay.
134:00:46|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. When you look out a detent 2 in the proper burn attitude, what you ought to see is the Sun at 12 o'clock, about halfway between the top of the AOT and the center of the pipper. And you ought to see the Earth  -
134:01:03|T|LMP|Okay.
134:01:04|C|Lousma|-  at 6 o'clock.
134:01:07|T|LMP|Okay.
134:01:41|T|CDR|And, it's getting a little warmer in here now. Thank you.
134:01:58|C|Slayton|Duck blinds are always warmer, Jim, when the birds are flying.
134:02:06|T|CDR|Right.
134:04:47|T|CDR|Jack, I've gotten so used to flying attitude with the TTCA, I won't be able to do it normally.
134:04:56|C|Lousma|Say again, Jim.
134:04:59|T|CDR|I said I gotten so used to flying attitude with the translational control, I won't be able to do with the ACA.
134:06:06|C|Lousma|Aquarius, we see your glycol temperature getting up there. If you want to make it a little warmer, or you can try putting your SUIT TEMP valve to HIGH, if you haven't already got it there.
134:06:25|T|LMP|Okay.
134:10:45|C|Lousma|Aquarius, something we're thinking about right now is, if we can do it without using a lot of RCS, it would be to our advantage timewise to try to get an alignment.
134:11:00|T|CDR|Okay. You mean a P52?
134:11:05|C|Lousma|We're  -
134:11:06|T|CDR|I'll take a look around.
134:11:07|C|Lousma|A combination of 51 and 52.
134:11:15|T|CDR|I'll see what we can do, Jack.
134:11:18|C|Lousma|Okay. And we'd planned to use the Moon and the Sun for that.
134:14:46|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. On panel 16, we'd like for you to close the CROSS TIE BAL LOADS breaker, please.
134:14:57|T|LMP|Okay. it's closed.
134:15:04|C|Lousma|And it looks like we could support a - an alignment in a few minutes, if you'd be willing to go ahead with that.
134:15:13|T|CDR|Jack, it sounds good. I think from our position here, we know where the Sun and Moon are and it's strictly going to be a pitch maneuver. But I think we can save some gas. I'll see what we can do.
134:15:24|C|Lousma|Roger.
134:22:58|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
134:23:00|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Aquarius.
134:23:02|T|CDR|We're all set to go. Are you going to ship us up a REFSMMAT?
134:23:06|C|Lousma|Yes, we are. Stand by 1.
134:23:09|T|CDR|Okay.
134:23:25|T|CDR|The Sun feels wonderful. It's shining in the rendezvous window.
134:23:32|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, before we can ship you a load, we'll have to have, on panel 11, under COMM, the UPDATA LINK circuit breaker closed.
134:23:54|T|CDR|It's closed.
134:24:00|C|Lousma|Roger. It'll be a few  -
134:24:01|T|CDR|We're in P00 and DATA.
134:24:02|C|Lousma|Okay. And it'll be a few minutes yet, Jim. We're still cranking it up.
134:24:10|T|LMP|Okay. Stay with it, Jack, and I'll go back to data.
134:24:15|C|Lousma|Roger.
134:25:00|T|LMP|I got ... in about 33-1/3 percent on that uplink. Too fast alarm.
134:25:13|C|Lousma|Say again on that, Fred.
134:25:17|T|LMP|I just got another uplink too fast when I took the DATA switch back off - It's happening, I guess, about a third of the time.
134:25:25|C|Lousma|Roger.
134:28:11|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We're ready with your load if you'll give us DATA please.
134:28:16|T|CDR|Going to DATA. You got it.
134:34:42|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. After the uplink, you'll have to set the drift and the REFSMMAT flag as on page 8 of the contingency book, steps 5 and 6.
134:34:55|T|CDR|Page 8, steps 5 and 6. Roger.
134:37:21|T|LMP|Okay. Are you done with the computer now, Jack?
134:37:24|C|Lousma|Negative. We'll give you the word.
134:37:27|C|Slayton|Roger. Aquarius, we're through with it, it's your computer.
134:37:32|T|CDR|Thank you.
134:39:32|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius, Houston; take option 1 on a P52 when you get to it. And I've got some ball angles for a Sun and Moon.
134:39:46|T|LMP|Okay. We want an option 1 and you've got some ball angles for Sun and Moon. And right now, Jim has the Sun pretty well squared away right in the middle of AOT.
134:41:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 134 hours 42 minutes. The crew began powering up the Lunar Module at about 133 hours 29 minutes. A little over an hour ago, we've since seen the currents in the Lunar Module come up from about 10 to 12 amps to their present level of about 40 amps. These currents actually went to a high of about 70 amps before stablizing out at the lower level as the heaters came on line and brought the equipment up to a proper temperature and then dropped off line. The crew reported it is getting somewhat warmer within the Lunar Module at this time. The cabin temperature reading that we have on the ground is based on the temperature of the glycol and water boiler, which is related to the amount of heat being transferred into the water boiler, and is about the best indication we have of cabin temperature. And that shows that the cabin temperature now has come up from about 54 degrees to about 56 degrees. This temperature, however, does show some lag and we would expect the cabin temperature has come up propably a bit more than is indicated by the temperature we're showing on the ground.
134:43:19|T|LMP|And have you got some planet vectors for us, Jack?
134:43:37|C|Lousma|Okay, Freddo. For the Sun, I've got 246; for the Moon I've got 250.
134:43:55|T|LMP|Are you talking about ball theta angles?
134:43:59|C|Lousma|Negative. I was - I was reporting the code for NOUN 70.
134:44:07|C|Duke|They're in the computer, Fred.
134:44:10|T|LMP|Oh, Okay.
134:49:06|T|CDR|Okay , Houston. We have the Sun marks and I'll start up at pitch now to go over and pick up the Moon.
134:49:14|C|Lousma|Roger.
134:53:22|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
134:53:24|C|Lousma|Go ahead.
134:53:27|T|CDR|Just as a note of interest, in this dock configurations for P52s, the command module docking probe is right down the middle of - the docking light, rather, is right down the middle of the detent. And when the Sun flashes on it, really makes it difficult.
134:53:48|C|Lousma|Roger.
134:55:28|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 134 hours 56 minutes. In Mission Control at this time, we're in the process of handing over shifts. Flight Director, Gene Kranz is taking over from Flight Director, Milton Windler. We will not have a change of shift briefing. The Flight Director plans to remain in the Control Center through splashdown, and we therefore, as I said, will not have a change of shift briefing - news briefing for this shift. In summarizing, briefly the events during the past 8 hours, from about 127 hours until about 130 hours, we passed up the Command Module and Lunar Module preentry checklists to the crew. Following this, the crew was advised to attempt to get some rest. Fred Haise remained on watch, but we limited the number of calls to the spacecraft to allow Fred also to get some rest, and about 128 hours 17 minutes, Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert indicated that they were going to begin a rest period. Fred Haise began a rest period at about 129 hours 39 minutes. At 132 hours 28 minutes, we put in the first call to the crew after Haise began his rest period. All three crewmen responded shortly thereafter, and Jack Swigert reported that they had gotten about 2 or 3 hours of sleep. They said that it was not very good sleep, that it had been quite cold, and almost impossible to sleep. Deke Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations who has been in the Control Center during the night and early morning advised Lovell at that point to consider taking dexedrine tablet. This is a stimulate carried in the medical kit. Lovell said he would consider it. We've heard no report from the crew at this time as to whether they have or not taken any medication. In response to the crew comments on the cold, we began looking at some methods of bringing the LM temperatures up. It was decided that we had adequate power margins in the LM batteries and also adequate water margins to power up the LM early, and this had been planned to occur at 6 hours prior to reentry, and we began the procedure about 3 hours earlier than that. Beginning to power up at about 9 hours prior to entry interface. At 133 hours 29 minutes, the crew began the checklist procedures to power up the LM and the current levels in the LM came up from about 10 to 12 amps, which is the normal power down, current level to about 70 amps, and then as heaters brought equipment up to temperature, and the heaters began to drop off line, the temperature stabilized out at about 40 amps, and the crew reported the temperature is coming up within the LM and we've seen a corresponding rise in temperature on our displays here. The temperature we were reading in the cabin prior to the power up was about 54 degrees since the equipment has been turned on, we've seen the temperature come up about 2 to 3 degrees. At the present time, we're 7 hours 40 minutes 54 seconds from entry interface, and 2 hours 40 minutes 51 seconds from the mid-course correction. Correction number 7, which is planned to occur 5 hours prior to reentry. The Flight Dynamics Officer is computing final maneuver PAD for this mid-course correction. The preliminary information on it was that it would be about 2.8 feet per second using the LM ascent stage - actually the LM reaction control system thrusters, and burning them for about 21 seconds duration. We expect that we will get an update to this when the Flight Dynamics Officer completes the final computations for the maneuver.
135:01:08|P|PAO|We will also have some preliminary numbers for the entry. We suspect that these will change once the mid-course correction is completed. These are the same numbers which were passed out at the previous change of shift briefing. They are as follows: We are predicting entry interface at a point in which the spacecraft reaches the 400,000 foot level to occur at 142 hours 40 minutes 40 seconds. The drogue chutes would deploy at 142 hours 48 minutes 53 seconds, and the main chutes, the main parachutes would come out at 142 hours 49 minutes 43 seconds with splashdown at 142 hours 54 minutes 40 seconds. As I said, we expect these times will shift somewhat when the mid-course correction has been completed. We also have the times for the beginning of blackout and the end of blackout.
135:02:10|T|CDR|Just like the simulator.
135:02:15|C|Lousma|Yes. It was good training.
135:02:21|P|PAO|The time we show for the beginning of blackout is 142 hours 40 minutes 58 seconds, and time for ending of blackout is 142 hours 44 minutes 3 seconds.
135:02:35|T|CDR|Well, Jack, that's what it says the torquing angles are.
135:02:39|C|Lousma|We haven't got them yet.
135:02:51|C|Lousma|Aquarius, hold on to torquing angles, Please.
135:02:55|T|CDR|We're doing that.
135:03:18|C|Lousma|Jim, the reason for the delay is that we're not seeing the data yet. We're having a checkpoint here; and as soon as they come up, we'll let you know what to do with them.
135:03:29|T|CDR|Okay. We had a large NOUN 05 of - what - 112, and our torquing angles, Jack, are minus 01713, minus 03278, minus 01395.
135:03:53|C|Lousma|Roger. Minus 01713, and we see them now.
135:04:17|C|Lousma|Aquarius, torque them.
135:04:20|T|CDR|Okay.
135:04:28|T|CDR|At 35:04:25.
135:06:10|C|Lousma|Aquarius, do you have a star close by there you could check?
135:06:18|T|CDR|I'll - I'll look around, Jack. I was just trying to get a check on the Moon, again, to see if those angles were indeed true, and we got the Moon back again and centered.
135:06:27|C|Lousma|Roger.
135:10:09|T|CDR|Okay, Jack. What you're reading now the angles? We had the Moon centered, and it's pretty close to what we have on the 8 ball, I guess. Close enough for any entry that we'd like to do.
135:10:20|C|Lousma|Roger. And I'm told that Denubla - Denebola and Regulus are nearby if you wanted to make a star check.
135:10:35|T|CDR|Okay. I'm going to start pitching around again, and I'll see if I can pick them up. I have Orion out here to my left a little bit, but it's pretty close to the - oh, here. I've got Sirius. That's a nice one. How about that?
135:10:55|C|Lousma|Sounds good here.
135:11:22|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. 135 hours 11 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. That was Apollo 13 Commander Jim Lovell talking with capsule communicator Jack Lousma. While 13- Apollo 13 is aligning the platform in the lunar module, our digital displays now show Apollo 13 at 50,905 nautical miles away from Earth. The spacecraft velocity reads 8,670 feet per second. We're at 135 hours 12 minutes, continuing to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
135:14:44|C|Lousma|Aquarius, is Jack sitting on the rumble seat there?
135:14:48|T|LMP|He was. He just headed upstairs to take another look around.
135:14:53|C|Lousma|Okay. I got a minor addition to the entry checklist for him. This time it's in the  -
135:14:58|T|LMP|Okay. Stand  -
135:15:00|C|Lousma|-  entry book.
135:15:02|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by 1. He has that in his pocket.
135:15:54|T|CDR|What I'm doing, Jack, is just - I'm pitching over now. I'm going to pick up another star. Sirius was just too far off. I thought I was going to use too much gas getting there.
135:16:05|C|Lousma|Roger.
135:16:08|T|CDR|By the time I get aligned in the - in the AOT - be nice if we didn't, have Odyssey attached, we could just AUTO - AUTO maneuver over to these things.
135:16:28|C|Lousma|Looks to us like you've got her aligned, Jim, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.
135:16:33|T|CDR|Yeah. I'm pretty confident that the platform's fairly decent.
135:17:38|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We need an E MOD VERB 74, when you've got a chance, please.
135:17:43|T|CDR|Okay. Coming to you.
135:22:23|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. Go ahead.
135:22:35|C|Lousma|Okay, Jack. On your entry checklist, on page 2-5. Down there on step 9, where it says 152 degrees pitch at .05g, adjacent to that, so that Recovery can see you better on the way down, we want you to turn your S-BAND, POWER AMPLIFIER to HIGH. Over.
135:23:25|T|CMP|Okay. Turn S-BAND, POWER AMP to HIGH at .05g time.
135:23:36|C|Lousma|That's affirmative.
135:23:49|T|CMP|Okay. Is that it?
135:23:52|C|Lousma|That's it, Jack.
135:27:02|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. 135 hours 27 minutes now into the mission. We're 2 minutes - 2 hours 12 minutes away from scheduled time of ignition for MCC-7. And our space digitals show 13 - Apollo 13 - at a distance of 49,577 nautical miles out from Earth, travelling at a speed of 8,790 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
135:32:42|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We're considering doing the midcourse with PGNS, unless you'd rather do it in AGS.
135:32:52|T|CDR|No. PGNS is fine with me. I just align myself up with the old ball again. So I've got you boresighted again, but any way you want to do it.
135:33:02|C|Lousma|Like you say, you might as well go first class.
135:33:06|T|CDR|I guess you're right.
135:33:13|T|LMP|Now wait a minute, Jack.
135:33:22|C|Lousma|I just lost a lot of friends there.
135:35:36|T|LMP|And, Jack, you can tell Owen Morris that the RCS SYSTEM A/B 2 QUAD 1 breaker is still nicely in.
135:35:52|C|Lousma|Roger. We'll pass the word.
135:36:10|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. That was Fred Haise talking to Jack Lousma. Owen Morris referred to in that conservation, is the deputy manager for the lunar module in the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, here at the Manned Spacecarft Center. We now show Apollo 13 at 48,822 nautical miles away from Earth. And at a velocity of 8,861 feet per second. At 135 hours 37 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.
135:38:21|C|Lousma|Aquarius, Houston. We think we've figured out a way to save you some time at a very critical - very full schedule. And that's by doing a docked coarse align, since we got the LM up now. That would save you a maneuver or two.
135:39:38|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. It seemed to me a docked coarse align might be quicker for - for Jack.
135:39:45|C|Lousma|Yes. We think it would be, and it'd save quite a bit of time at a place where you're going to be pretty busy. Also save you some petrol.
135:39:56|T|CDR|Affirm.
135:40:13|C|Lousma|Okay, Jim. We're looking at doing this in the service module SEP attitude, and the optics will be pointed away from the Sun. So it should be a good attitude for a P52.
135:40:34|T|CDR|Okay. So, we'll be going to the service module SEP attitude, at which time we'll do a docked coarse align, and  -
135:40:54|T|CDR|Then you want - You want Jack then to do a P52?
135:41:20|C|Lousma|The way we'll do that in our time line Jim, is to go ahead and do the service module JETT and then we'll just stay in that attitude and when it comes time in our time line as we've outlined, to bring the platform up, we'll proceed with the P52 - coarse align, and then the P52.
135:41:40|T|CDR|Okay. Are we going to use the same techniques that we normally do for LM activation? In other words, I try to maintain an attitude, and give him some angles and then - Are you going to give him the angles? Then he does the 52.
135:41:57|C|Lousma|Basically, it's the same procedure just reversed, Jim.
135:42:01|T|CDR|Okay.
135:42:02|C|Lousma|Another nice thing about this, is it's one we've done before.
135:42:40|C|Lousma|And, Aquarius. One thing, however, that we do not plan to do is to proceed with the command module powerup prematurely.
135:42:51|T|LMP|Roger.
135:42:56|T|CDR|Understand.
135:45:27|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. This is Jack.
135:45:32|C|Lousma|Go ahead, Jack.
135:45:33|T|CMP|Okay. I just wanted to talk over with you, it looks like we've had some changes in the flight plan here, due to Jim's P52. Do you have - Can you talk over with me what your plans are?
135:45:50|C|Lousma|Roger, Jack. Since we've got the PGNS up, we plan to use that information to give the CMC a docked coarse align, and then we're in the service module jettison attitude, we'll wait until it comes time to power up the CMC, and we'll get the CMC a docked coarse align, and we'll pick some good stars to give you a fine align with, and it looks like we can pick some stars that are looking away from the Sun in which you can find in that service module jettison attitude; so, we'll save you quite a bit of gas, and save you some time in a very busy time.
135:46:36|T|CMP|Hey, that sounds good. Really fine.
135:46:40|C|Lousma|Keeping warm?
135:46:43|T|CMP|Hey, it's warmed up here now. It's almost comfortable.
135:46:52|T|CDR|I'm looking out the window now, Jack, and that Earth is whistling in like a high-speed freight train.
135:47:00|P|PAO|That's command module pilot, Jack Swigert, describing the temperature and Apollo 13, as you copied. The comfort level is going up.
135:47:12|C|Lousma|We're clocking you at 48,000 miles and coming in at about 9,000.
135:47:21|T|CDR|I don't think there's many LMs that have seen it like this. I'm still looking for Fra Mauro and Cone Crater.
135:47:38|C|Slayton|You're going the wrong way, son.
135:47:48|P|PAO|That was Donald K. Slayton who came on the CapCom line to point out to Jim Lovell that they're headed the wrong way for Fra Mauro and Cone Crater. Our displays now show Apollo 13 at 47,858 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity reading 8,956 feet per second. We're at 135 hours, 48 minutes, now into the flight of Apollo 13. This is Apollo Control Houston.
135:48:29|T|CMP|Okay, Jack. It looks - Just looking over what I may expect here, it looks like I'm just going to get three angles to do a VERB 41 NOUN 20, right?
135:48:45|C|Lousma|That's what it looks like from here, Jack. It's pretty much the opposite of the LM activation procedure where we do the docked coarse align.
135:49:05|T|CMP|Yes, except in a way we did a lot of VERB 06 NOUN 20, ENTERS, simultaneously, and then you all shipped him up post-torque values. You're not going to do anything like that are you?
135:49:20|C|Lousma|Say again, please, Jack.
135:49:23|T|CMP|Okay. During the activation part, we do a lot of VERB 06 NOUN 20, ENTERS simultaneously, reading you out the difference in the angles, and then MSFN furnishes the post-torquing angles, in order to get the platform fine aligned. Do you plan something like that or just three coarse align angles.
135:49:53|C|Lousma|Jack, we're going to give you three coarse align angles, and then you can go right to your checklist as we're giving it, and start in with the VERB 40 NOUN 20.
135:50:07|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine.
135:52:10|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston now 135 hours, 52 minutes now into the mission. Our displays in Mission Control indicate the lunar module cabin temperature now getting up to around 60 degrees. The spacecraft currently running around 40 amps. This is as compared to 10 to 12 amps when 13 was in a powered down state. As you recall, we brought the lunar module -
135:52:45|T|LMP|And, Jack, how do you read?
135:52:48|C|Lousma|Five square.
135:52:52|P|PAO|As you recall, we brought the lunar -
135:52:54|T|LMP|Okay, I was around shooting pictures of all the debris inside here, before we left, and I inadvertently changed the settings on the DC command module Reseau camera that we need for the service module pictures. I wonder if FAO can dig them out again - what we need, f-stop and speed.
135:53:18|C|Lousma|Okay, Fred. Stand by.
135:53:49|P|PAO|We brought the lunar module power up about 3 hours early this morning, because Apollo 13 now has the luxury of margins in both power and water. This does give an added bonus. It puts the 13 crew a step ahead in what could be considered a very busy time line. We're now at 135 hours, 54 minutes into the flight. We show Apollo 13 at 47,312 nautical miles away from Earth, velocity now reading 9,010 feet per second. This is Apollo Control Houston.
135:54:55|C|Lousma|Fred, in regards to the camera settings, for black-and-white 3400 film, the settings were f:5.6 at 1/250th. Over.
135:55:09|T|LMP|Okay. I'd guessed right then after all, but thank you.
136:04:59|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
136:05:03|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
136:05:04|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. I got MCC-7 PAD when you're ready to copy. Over.
136:05:09|T|CDR|Okay. Stand by.
136:05:32|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. We're standing by for -
136:05:35|T|LMP|Okay. We're in luck, I got one PAD left.
136:05:38|C|Kerwin|Okay. We'll take care not to change this one. You ready to go?
136:05:45|T|LMP|Go ahead, Joe.
136:05:46|C|Kerwin|MCC-7: 137:39:48.39, minus 0003.1, plus all zeros, plus 00001, N/A, plus 0020.5, 0003.1, 0:23, 008, 359; the rest is N/A. Remarks: plus-X, four jets, RCS; and your weights for the DAP load: LM weight, 25181; CSM weight, 62468. Over.
136:07:02|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. MCC-7: 137:39:48.39, minus 0003.1, plus all balls, plus 0000.1, N/A, plus 0020.5, plus 0003.1, 0:23, 008, 359; the rest of pad N/A. Remarks: plus-X, four jets, RCS, ullage; the LM weight, 25181; CSM weight, 62468. Over.
136:07:51|C|Kerwin|Okay. Readback correct.
136:08:22|C|Kerwin|And, Aquarius; Houston. I have a service module SEP PAD if you want to copy that, now. Over.
136:08:32|T|LMP|Say again, Joe.
136:08:34|C|Kerwin|Roger, Fred. I have a service module SEP PAD with the attitudes. You don't need a PAD sheet for it; just any old blank sheet will do.
136:08:49|T|LMP|Okay. I was going to say I don't - We don't hardly carry a service module SEP PAD.
136:08:56|C|Kerwin|Yes, we'll have to change that.
136:09:02|T|LMP|Okay. I'm using a P27 here. Go ahead.
136:09:06|C|Kerwin|Okay. The PAD reads as follows and then I'll repeat the angles for you so you can copy them. The following MCC-7, maneuver the LM to the following FDAI attitudes: roll, 000; pitch, 91.3; yaw, 000. Now do you want those attitudes repeated, Fred?
136:09:40|T|LMP|Okay. Following MCC-7 we're to maneuver to the following attitudes: roll, 000; pitch, 091.3; yaw, 000.
136:09:54|C|Kerwin|Okay. That's correct. And the last part of the PAD is at GET 138:10:00, which is EI minus 4.5 hours, execute a push of 0.5 feet per second, four jet, plus-X; perform SM SEP; then execute pull, 0.5 feet per second, four jet, minus-X. Over.
136:10:45|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. Jack's entering the command module, now.
136:10:48|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim.
136:11:14|T|LMP|Okay. That last Joe was execute at the GET at 138:10:00 which is EI minus 4-1/2 hours; execute a push of 0.5 feet per second, four-jet ullage; then execute SM SEP followed by a pull of 0.5 feet per second, with respect to a nomenclature on the TTCA; I think we really meaning an up of 0.5 and then a down of 0.5.
136:11:46|C|Kerwin|That's correct, Fred.
136:12:02|C|Kerwin|Okay, Aquarius. The last PAD I had for you right now is the LM jettison PAD. Similar to the - Stand by 1, Aquarius.
136:12:22|C|Kerwin|Okay, Aquarius; Houston. Request P00 and DATA for a data load. Over.
136:12:28|T|LMP|You got it.
136:12:30|C|Kerwin|Okay. And I was about to say the LM jettison PAD is similar to the SM SEP PAD, Fred, when you're ready to copy.
136:12:42|T|LMP|Just about the same number of lines?
136:12:44|C|Kerwin|Yes.
136:13:09|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead, Joe.
136:13:11|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. Prior to 141:40:00, which is EI minus 1 hour, maneuver the LM to the following FDAI angles: roll, 130; pitch, 125; yaw, 012.4. The corresponding CSM gimbal angles will be roll, 291; pitch, 196; yaw, 045, and that's the PAD. Over. And the computer is yours, Aquarius.
136:14:14|T|CDR|Thank you.
136:14:23|T|LMP|Okay. A LM SEP PAD prior to 141:40:00, EI minus 1 hour, maneuver to following attitudes: roll, 130; pitch, 125; yaw, 012.4. The corresponding CSM gimbal angles are roll, 291; pitch, 196; yaw, 045.
136:14:49|C|Kerwin|Readback correct.
136:15:15|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. Now 136 hours 15 minutes now into the flight. That maneuver PAD for midcourse 7 it was passed up. Shows that the time of igition of 137 hours 39 minutes 48.39 seconds, with a DELTA-V of 3.1 feet per second, and a burn duration of 23 seconds. Jim Lovell reported Jack Swigert entering the command module, and we copied that time.
136:15:57|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
136:16:01|T|LMP|Go ahead, Joe.
136:16:02|C|Kerwin|Okay. We're so efficient down here that we got an entry PAD ready, Fred. Do you want to copy that for Jack? Over.
136:16:10|T|LMP|Stand by. I'll have to try to borrow his book from him.
136:16:14|C|Kerwin|Roger.
136:16:17|T|CDR|Can we hold off on that a little bit, Joe?
136:16:19|C|Kerwin|Oh, absolutely, Jim. We're well ahead. I just wanted to let you know that we had it.
136:16:25|T|CDR|Okay. I hope that when you send up all those uplinks to Jack that you could get them up to him quickly.
136:16:33|C|Kerwin|We're shooting for less than 5 minutes.
136:16:38|T|CDR|Sounds good.
136:16:41|P|PAO|We copied Jack Swigert -
136:16:43|T|LMP|And are you still using the computer?
136:16:46|C|Kerwin|That's a negative, Fred. The computer is yours.
136:16:54|P|PAO|We copied Swigert entering the command module at 136 hours 10 minutes 49 seconds -
136:16:58|C|Kerwin|And, Fred, the computer has your target load in.
136:17:04|T|LMP|Okay.
136:17:13|P|PAO|Joe Kerwin, by the way, is taking over the position as capsule communicator in the Mission Control Center. Well, in the command module Swigert will be warming up some of the systems. Throwing the circuit breakers and main bus B and some of the heaters for equipment onboard the command module. Almost at the same time as Swigert entered the command module, Ken Mattingly came in the control center still in an apparently spotless condition. We're at 136 hours 18 minutes into the flight. We show Apollo 13 at an altitude of 45,255 nautical miles, traveling at a speed of 9,222 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
136:18:56|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
136:18:59|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, Aquarius.
136:19:01|T|CDR|Okay. I just want to clarify one thing on the LM SEP PAD. It appears to me that in my configuration, I could probably use a VERB 49 loading in 622, yaw, pitch, and roll, in that order; and then being able to fly out at 5018 in roll, pitch, and yaw. Is that correct?
136:19:24|C|Kerwin|Stand by; I'll verify it, Jim.
136:19:29|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. And while you're doing that I've got a question about the command module checklist
136:19:32|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. Go ahead with your question.
136:19:37|T|CMP|Okay. Either I copied the circuit breaker wrong, or - I can't read it. Comes down just about the - oh, about the 20th one down, after panel 276, where it says CB INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL 3 and 4, open. The next circuit breaker on panel 5 - I - Would you give that to me again?
136:20:02|C|Kerwin|Roger. That's CB ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER, MAIN B. Over. And it's, closed.
136:20:16|T|CMP|Okay. I just can't, right - I just can't read my writing, ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER MAIN B, closed.
136:20:20|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative.
136:21:39|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
136:21:45|T|LMP|Go ahead, Joe.
136:21:46|C|Kerwin|Roger. The word we have is that you can't make a VERB 49 maneuver to the LM jettison attitude because those are FDAI angles we gave you, they don't correspond to the gimbal angles for the load; it'll have to be a manual maneuver. Over.
136:22:05|T|LMP|Okay.
136:22:06|C|Kerwin|And mind out for gimbal lock.
136:22:12|T|LMP|We will.
136:25:49|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston at 136 hours 26 minutes now into the flight. Our clock in Mission Control shows the time of ignition for the midcourse burn at 1 hour 14 minutes from this time. 30 minutes after the midcourse, or 4-1/2 hours prior to time entry interface, the service module is scheduled to be jettisoned. At that time Jack Swigert will be in the command module. Jim Lovell and Fred Haise in the lunar module. Lovell will fire the lunar module thrust to push the service module about 1/2 foot per second. Swigert, then, activates the pyros with a switch in the command module. After separation, Apollo 13 will back off with the lunar module reaction control system at 1/2 foot per second providing a separation DELTA velocity of 1 foot per second. All three crewmen will be trying to take pictures of the service module at that time. Swigert out of window number 5 in the command module. Lovell and Haise out of the lunar module. For separation, Apollo 13 will pitch about 90 degrees along the radial axis. That would be 90 degrees off the flight path angle. And at time of entry interface, or entry into the Earth's atmosphere, the command module and service module should be more than 16,000 feet apart. We're at 136 hour 28 minutes into the flight. We show Apollo 13 at a distance of 44,395 nautical miles, and a velocity of 9,312 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
136:42:01|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
136:42:05|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
136:42:07|C|Kerwin|Roger. We're looking at LM current, to see if Jack has started his preheat, and we haven't seen it yet. Is he doing okay down there?
136:42:24|T|CDR|Houston, Jack said he's already started it, and he said that in 1 more minute, he'll be up to 20 minutes.
136:42:31|C|Kerwin|Oh. Roger that.
136:42:42|C|Kerwin|Jim, Houston. Have him let us know what his test meter reads when he's done.
136:42:51|T|CDR|He says that he had a Battery A voltage drop of 2 volts, and he'll try to look at the test meter for you right now.
136:42:55|C|Kerwin|Okay.
136:42:58|T|CDR|He's been looking at, them, but they haven't been coming up, so far.
136:43:02|C|Kerwin|We copy.
136:44:22|T|CDR|Do you see a current now, Houston?
136:44:28|C|Kerwin|Stand by 1 on that, Jim. That's affirmative, Jim; it looks like we are seeing one now.
136:44:43|T|CDR|Okay. And thanks for keeping us honest.
136:44:51|C|Kerwin|Okay.
136:46:43|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
136:46:46|T|CDR|Go ahead.
136:46:47|C|Kerwin|Roger. Reminder P41 for the RCS burn.
136:46:54|T|CDR|Thanks for keeping us honest.
136:46:57|C|Kerwin|We got to protect our jobs, Jim.
136:47:08|T|CDR|We've been DPS-ing so long here.
136:47:12|C|Kerwin|Yes.
136:47:20|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. 136 hours 47 minutes. The Flight Control team here in Mission Control monitoring the display noted that Jim Lovell had punched his onboard computer into program 40 which is the thrusting program for the descent propulsion system. Then came the reminder to go to program 41 for a reaction control system of mid-course burn. We show that we're 51 minutes 50 seconds from time of ignition, with Apollo 13 at a distance of 42,599 nautical miles away from Earth with a velocity of 9,515 feet per second. That's 51 minutes 30 seconds now from time of ignition for mid-course - for the mid-course burn. This is Apollo Control, Houston at 136 hours 49 minutes now into the flight.
136:54:30|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I finished up the maneuvers, the AUTO maneuver in 41; but my roll and yaw needles seem to be offset. Pitch is okay.
136:54:41|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We copy. Stand by.
136:54:41|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We copy. Stand by.
136:55:01|T|CDR|Okay.
137:04:39|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
137:04:53|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Did you call?
137:04:57|T|LMP|Roger, Joe. Figured, if we're going to do this burn in PGNS now, I ought to give you an update on the contingency book pages 32, 33, and 34, because the last time we went through this portion, we were burning it in AGS.
137:05:22|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. Stand by. We've been talking about possibly having you do it in AGS. We recommend at this time that you do an AGS to PGNS align, the 400 plus 3 procedure only. Over.
137:05:44|T|LMP|Okay.
137:06:19|C|Kerwin|And, Aquarius, Houston
137:06:23|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
137:06:24|C|Kerwin|Roger. We recommend that you perform this burn in AGS, as you did the last midcourse maneuver; we think it will save gas. Over.
137:06:36|T|CDR|Okay. Joe, do you want me to line up the same way we did the last one, too?
137:06:42|C|Kerwin|Stand by on that.
137:06:47|P|PAO|That was capsule communicator Joe Kerwin, passing along to Jim Lovell the recommendation to perform the midcourse burn with the abort guidance system.
137:06:57|T|LMP|And, Joe, Jack just handed me some injector temperatures, if you want a reading on those, I can plug them in.
137:07:05|C|Kerwin|Roger. Go ahead with those.
137:07:07|T|LMP|Okay. 5 Charlie, 4.0; 5 Dogs, 3.7; 6 Able, 3.5; 6 Bravo, 4.1; 6 Charlie, 4.2; 6 Delta, 3.8.
137:07:21|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy those, Fred.
137:09:09|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
137:09:11|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
137:09:13|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. Our recommendation on this burn is that you maneuver to the burn attitude, in PGNS MIN IMPULSE, then do a body-axis align, 400 plus 5, followed by 400 plus 0, and then do the burn in AGS. Over.
137:09:34|T|CDR|Okay. Now we're spinning it with the PGNS, what you gave us for a PGNS attitude. Is this the wrong one? Do you want me to just to align up the Earth as I did before in the last midcourse?
137:09:46|C|Kerwin|No. We don't want you to do that. Read me your FDAI angles, and let's compare them with what we have down here.
137:09:55|T|CDR|Okay. You're looking at them in the DSKY. I've got roll of 8.47; pitch of about 0.51; and yaw looking at about 3.750.
137:10:18|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. Those are very close - I guess all you need to do is trim them up a bit.
137:10:26|T|CDR|I plan to do a final trim - AUTO trim, and then a four-jet translation.
137:10:40|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. For fuel conservation, we'd prefer you to trim it up MIN IMPULSE, and there's really very little trim required; and then go ahead and do it AGS. We're on the expected fuel usage, but we're just being old ladies about it.
137:10:58|T|CDR|Okay. Understand. My only question, Joe, is the fact that both the roll and the yaw needles did not go to null when I did an AUTO maneuver. I'd tried to go manually to the attitude; and then went to AUTO, but the roll and the yaw do not come in at all.
137:11:14|C|Kerwin|Roger. I haven't got an answer on that yet, but your attitude looks very close.
137:11:19|T|CDR|Okay. I can take it out in pitch.
137:12:45|T|CDR|And, Houston, Aquarius. I'm not sure that if I follow and null the needles, that will be the proper attitude.
137:13:02|C|Kerwin|Okay. Stand by 1, Jim. We're talking about it. It's going to be very close; in any event, close enough.
137:13:10|T|CDR|Okay.
137:13:16|C|Kerwin|And, Jim, just for your information, I have the entry PAD. I have the landing area weather summary, which you probably don't even have to copy, but which I'll read up to you when you're ready; and some stars for Jack that I'm holding for him for later on.
137:13:31|T|CDR|Okay.
137:13:42|T|LMP|And, Joe, Jack says all the injector temperatures, he just checked them again, and they're all over 3.9  -
137:13:50|C|Kerwin|Understand, that they're all over 3.9 now. Thanks a lot.
137:13:58|C|Kerwin|You can tell him that it's looking good to us. They were even happy with the previous ones.
137:14:05|T|LMP|Okay.
137:14:27|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 137 hours 15 minutes now into the flight. We show a time of ignition of - for the midcourse burn a little over 25 minutes away now. This will be a burn with a DELTA V of 3.1 feet per second. Duration of the burn 23 seconds. It will be done retrograde. It's a relatively long duration on the burn.
137:15:02|T|CDR|And, my only question, Houston, is do you want me to null the PGNS needle manually?
137:15:08|C|Kerwin|Okay. Stand by 1 more minute, Jim.
137:15:16|P|PAO|-  relatively long duration on the burn because of the large spacecraft weight at this time. We show the spacecraft weight at 87,649 pounds at the present. Again the midcourse burn will be done retrograde. We're at 137 hours 16 minutes into the flight. We show Apollo 13 at 40,081 nautical miles away from the Earth and travelling at a speed of 9,814 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
137:16:47|T|LMP|Houston, Aquarius.
137:16:49|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, Aquarius.
137:16:51|T|LMP|Yes. I guess the basic question is comparing the balls here and out the window it doesn't look too unreasonable, and I guess Jim says the COAS is yawed and rolled slightly off from what he might eyeball; but yet, the FDAI error needles for PGNS are showing a full scale left in roll and full scale left in yaw. It appears with those -
137:17:17|C|Kerwin|Okay. Go ahead.
137:17:23|T|LMP|Yes. It appears if we track those we, obviously, aren't going to be on the attitude that we burned the last midcourse.
137:17:30|C|Kerwin|Okay. Well, this attitude we passed you is not quite aligned to the terminator, and stand by on this.
137:19:33|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, 137 hours 20 minutes into the flight. A goodly gathering of the astronaut corp in the Mission Control Center now, Donald K. Slayton is here, as is Tom Stafford, Chief of the Astronaut Office. Charlie Duke is here, Ken Mattingly, Gene Cernan in addition to Joe Kerwin, immediately around the CapCom console. On the first row is Ron Evans and Tony England. Meanwhile, in the back is Jim McDivitt, manning one of the positions at the management console. Jim McDivitt, as you recall, is the manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office at present. We're at a distance now of 39,635 nautical miles away from Earth.
137:20:34|T|CDR|How you doing, there, Houston?
137:20:37|C|Kerwin|Oh, we're getting there, Jim. We're - we're all agreed that you're almost, but not quite, in the proper attitude, and we're just trying to get you one firm recommendation on how to proceed from here.
137:20:48|T|CDR|Okay. I have nulled the null - roll needle and the pitch needle now and I'm yawed - rolled left now. I'm rolled left about 9 degrees.
137:20:59|C|Kerwin|Okay. Understand the needles are nulled
137:21:03|T|CDR|The yaw isn't, but the pitch and roll are.
137:21:07|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
137:23:50|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
137:23:52|T|CDR|Go ahead.
137:23:53|C|Kerwin|Okay. Here's the big story. Your attitude really looks quite good except in roll, and we'd like you to do the following. In MIN impulse PGNS, we'd like you to trim to zero pitch, which is about where you are now; to 008 degrees in roll, which is about 16 degrees from your present roll attitude; and to zero degrees in yaw, which is about where you are now. Then we'd like you to do the body-axis align 400 plus 5, 400 plus 0. PITCH and ROLL to PULSE, select AGS, do the burn in AGS. How does that sound? Over.
137:24:33|T|CDR|Okay. I'm rolled the wrong way; that is what you're saying, right?
137:24:37|C|Kerwin|That's right.
137:24:46|P|PAO|Apollo Control at Houston. We're 15 minutes away now -
137:24:49|T|CDR|And you know I can't roll in minimum impulse. I've got to use TTCAs.
137:24:56|C|Kerwin|That's right, Jim. Sorry.
137:25:00|P|PAO|Less than 15 minutes away now from the scheduled time of the midcourse burn. 137 hours 25 minutes into the flight and Apollo 13 now 39,206 nautical miles away from Earth with a speed of 9,927 feet per second.
137:26:26|T|CDR|And you don't want me to automatically trim 5018, I take it.
137:26:42|C|Kerwin|That's affirm, Jim. Don't trim 5018.
137:26:46|T|CDR|Okay.
137:26:53|C|Kerwin|We just want you to cycle on through P41 to get the AVERAGE G and burn it out.
137:25:59|T|CDR|Okay.
137:27:51|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
137:27:53|T|CDR|Go ahead.
137:27:54|C|Kerwin|Just for your information, we see 3.0 in register 1. We read you up 3.1 on the PAD. The actual DELTA-V was 3.05, and they warned me that it might come out 3.0.
137:28:11|T|CDR|Okay. That's a little burn.
137:28:13|C|Kerwin|Right.
137:29:36|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Your attitude looks real good. We will give you a mark at 10 minutes to the burn, which is in 28 seconds.
137:29:46|T|CDR|Okay. We'll burn it in AGS and use the AGS ball.
137:29:54|C|Kerwin|Right. I was looking at the wrong clock, and we're a little under 10 minutes now. I'll give you a mark at 9 minutes. Okay?
137:30:05|T|CDR|That's fine.
137:30:07|P|PAO|Apollo Control. That was Joe Kerwin confirming to Jim Lovell, Spacecraft Commander, that spacecraft attitude for the burn does look good. We're at 137 hours 30 minutes into the flight. Now showing, Apollo 13 at 38,700 nautical miles away from Earth, current speed 9,990 feet per second.
137:30:36|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. We have 10 seconds until 9 minutes to the burn. 3, 2, 1  -
137:30:49|C|Kerwin|MARK.
137:30:50|C|Kerwin|Nine minutes.
137:30:53|T|CDR|Very well. That agrees with our event timer.
137:30:56|C|Kerwin|Okay.
137:33:45|P|PAO|Apollo Control coming up on 6 minutes to time of the midcourse burn. This burn performed will be a backup guiding system aboard Aquarius. The burn retrograde will provide a delta velocity of 3 feet per second and with a predicted burn duration of 21 seconds. We're at 137 hours 34 minutes into the flight, and this is Apollo Control, Houston. One correction. That burn duration is 23 seconds not 21 seconds. We're at 137 hours 35 minutes into the Flight. We show Apollo 13 at 38,303 nautical miles away from Earth, and with a velocity of 10,045 feet per second. Less than 5 minutes now away from scheduled time of ignition.
137:36:57|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. About 3 minutes to go, and we're all squared away.
137:37:14|C|Kerwin|And, Aquarius; Houston. Roger that. And we're standing by for your body-axis align and your zeroing 404, 405, 406, going to 470.
137:37:27|T|LMP|Okay. You'd asked - you'd asked me before, Joe, to go 400 plus 3, which I did. I assume you've changed the script again.
137:37:52|P|PAO|Less than 2 minutes away now from scheduled time of ignition. We're at 137 hours, 38 minutes in the flight.
137:38:08|C|Kerwin|Okay, Fred. We did tell you to do that awhile ago, and it doesn't matter; you're looking good.
137:38:15|T|LMP|Okay.
137:38:47|P|PAO|One minute away now.
137:39:37|P|PAO|Ten seconds away now.
137:39:50|T|LMP|Yes. It looks like we had a minus 0.2 bias for 470. We're burning.
137:39:54|C|Kerwin|Copy that, Fred.
137:40:01|P|PAO|Fred Haise reporting that the burn is underway. We're at 137 hours, 40 minutes into the flight.
137:40:24|C|Kerwin|Good show, Aquarius.
137:40:28|P|PAO|We've shut down.
137:40:29|T|CDR|We're tweaking now, Joe.
137:40:31|C|Kerwin|Roger. Aquarius, Houston. You're good right where you are.
137:40:40|T|CDR|Okay. That's it.
137:40:49|T|LMP|Okay. If you're happy, can we maneuver to service module SEP attitude now?
137:40:57|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative, Aquarius.
137:41:01|P|PAO|That was Fred Haise requesting that 13 maneuver to service module separation attitude following this - this burn which went right on the money. We're at 137 hours, 41 minutes.
137:41:19|T|CDR|And I'm pitching up to the proper attitude.
137:41:23|C|Kerwin|Okay. We're looking at it.
137:41:26|T|CDR|And it's again necessary to use the TTCA to pitch.
137:41:30|C|Kerwin|Okay. Affirmative.
137:41:57|P|PAO|For the Service Module separation, Apollo 13 will pitch about 90 degrees along the radial axis. That's 90 degrees off the flight path angle. We show 13 at the present time at a distance of 37,581 nautical miles away with a velocity of 10,138 feet per second. We're now at 137 hours, 42 minutes into the mission. This is Apollo Control Houston.
137:43:55|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
137:43:58|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
137:43:59|C|Kerwin|Okay. Recommend you terminate P41.
137:44:08|T|CDR|Okay.
137:47:38|C|Slayton|Hey, Jim, have you broken into the medical kit per my recommendation a few hours ago?
137:47:46|T|CDR|Yes. Everything is taken care of, Deke.
137:47:49|C|Slayton|Okay, fine. You might hit it again in about 2 hours.
137:47:55|T|CDR|Okay.
137:48:09|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston, 137 hours, 48 minutes. That was Donald K. Slayton on the line talking to Jim Lovell; the recommendation he referred to was the recommendation he made earlier in the morning that the Apollo 13 crew take Dexedrine tablets. We now show Apollo 13 in an altitude of 36,969 nautical miles.
137:50:13|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. The guidance and control officer for the lunar module here in mission control confirms they are moving in an attitude now for separation.
137:50:37|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. AFT OMNI.
137:50:41|T|CDR|I beat you to it, Houston.
137:50:43|C|Kerwin|Yes. I thought you did, but I thought I'd say it anyway.
137:50:57|P|PAO|Our count down clock shows that we are 19 minutes away now from time of separation; service module jettison; for this Jack Swigert is in the command module; Jim Lovell and Fred Haise in the lunar module; Commander Lovell will fire the thruster, or fire the thrust, LM thrust to push the service module at one half foot per second; Swigert activates the PYROS with a switch in the command module. After separation, 13 will back off with the lunar module RCS at one half foot per second, providing the separation delta velocity of one foot per second. We are 137 hours, 52 minutes into the flight and Apollo 13 now 36,616 nautical miles away; this is Apollo Control Houston.
137:55:52|C|Kerwin|Okay, Aquarius; Houston. That attitude looks pretty good. How's Jack getting along?
137:55:58|T|CDR|He's getting along, all set to go. And I'm going to go into PGNS ATT HOLD.
137:56:02|C|Kerwin|Roger.
137:57:06|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
137:57:10|T|CDR|Go ahead.
137:57:11|C|Kerwin|Roger. Again for fuel-consumption reasons, we'd like you to go back to the AGS mode you were in rather than PGNS ATT HOLD. Over.
137:57:20|T|CDR|Okay. I'm in PGNS MINIMUM IMPULSE right now while we're firing. And I'll go back to the AGS mode.
137:57:31|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. PGNS MIN IMPULSE is okay; AGS is okay too. It's your choice.
137:57:37|T|CDR|Soon as we get rid of the service module, Joe, I think I'll be able to maneuver a lot better.
137:57:42|C|Kerwin|Sure thing.
137:57:48|T|CDR|Okay, Jack just reported that all thrusters fired on both rings.
137:57:53|C|Kerwin|Real fine. Real fine.
137:58:12|P|PAO|That was the test of the thrusters on the command module, and as you heard, they all fired - we are at 137 hours, 58 minutes into the flight, and this is Apollo Control Houston.
137:58:32|T|CDR|And SM JETT at 138:12.
137:58:43|C|Kerwin|Roger. Understand; that's SM JETT, 138:12. It's not that time critical, Jim.
137:58:52|T|CDR|Can we do it at any time, Joe?
137:58:55|C|Kerwin|I think so, but let me check. Aquarius, Houston. That's affirmative. You can jettison the service module when you are ready; no big rush, but any time.
137:59:14|T|CDR|Okay. Sounds good.
138:00:41|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
138:00:44|T|CDR|Go ahead.
138:00:45|C|Kerwin|Roger. We recommend that you use the AGS for the separation maneuver, because we'd like to get the proper weight in for the DAP before we use the PGNS again.
138:00:59|T|CDR|Roger. We will. Stand by.
138:01:05|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston, 138 hours, 1 minutes into the flight; as you heard earlier, Joe Kerwin told Apollo 13 that they could separate at their convenience, that followed a time identified by Jim Lovell, which would be some 2 minutes after what we had earlier carried on the ground, we now show Apollo 13 at a distance of 35,729 nautical miles away from Earth, traveling at a speed of 10,400 feet per second. At 138 hours, 2 minutes, into the flight, this is Apollo Control Houston.
138:02:06|T|CDR|SM SEP.
138:02:09|C|Kerwin|Copy that.
138:02:20|P|PAO|We copied that report from Jim Lovell, of service module separation at 138 hours, 2 minutes, 8 seconds.
138:02:35|P|PAO|And as you heard, that was ahead of schedule. We presently show Apollo 13 at 35,611 nautical miles away from Earth.
138:03:53|T|CDR|Do you see it, Jack?
138:04:26|C|Kerwin|Okay, Aquarius; Houston. I recommend you terminate AVERAGE G. Over.
138:04:33|T|CDR|Okay, I've got her, Houston.
138:04:36|C|Kerwin|Beautiful, beautiful. And for you information, Jim, you'll be coming up on an RCS caution light for helium. No sweat. Over.
138:04:46|T|CDR|And there's one whole side of that spacecraft missing.
138:04:50|C|Kerwin|Is that right?
138:04:57|T|CDR|Right by the - Look out there, will you? Right by the high gain antenna, the whole panel is blown out, almost from the base to the engine.
138:05:09|C|Kerwin|Copy that.
138:05:22|T|LMP|Yes, it looks like it got to the SPS bell, too, Houston.
138:05:28|C|Kerwin|Think it zinged the SPS engine bell, huh?
138:05:31|T|LMP|That's the way it looks; unless that's just a dark brown streak. It's really a mess.
138:05:39|P|PAO|You heard that report from Jim Lovell, as Aquarius is moving away from the service module at the present time.
138:05:51|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We'd like you to get some pictures, but we want you to conserve RCS. Don't make unnecessary maneuvers.
138:06:08|C|Kerwin|And, Jim; Houston. In particular, of course, we don't want any translation maneuvers.
138:06:16|T|CDR|Right on that. Joe, you realize that when I went up to the SM SEP attitude, I had to use TTCA to do it.
138:06:25|C|Kerwin|That's affirm. We know that. That's okay.
138:06:32|P|PAO|Fred Haise followed Jim's remark with the comment that it got through the service propulsion system bell too. That it was really a mess. We're at 138 hours 7 minutes into the flight. Apollo 13 now 35,200 nautical miles -
138:06:50|T|CDR|All right. She's drifting right down in front of our windows now, Houston.
138:06:55|C|Kerwin|Okay.
138:08:12|T|LMP|Okay, Joe, I'm now looking down the SPS bell, and it looks - looks okay on the inside; maybe it is just a streak.
138:08:19|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that, Fred. Was the bell deformed on the outside or just nicked or what?
138:08:33|T|CDR|I think the explosion, from what I could see, Joe, had - had stained it. I don't know whether it did any actual deformation or not.
138:08:41|C|Kerwin|Okay.
138:09:09|T|LMP|Man, that's unbelievable!
138:09:38|T|CDR|And, Joe, looks like a lot of - a lot of debris is just hanging out the side near the S-band antenna.
138:09:47|C|Kerwin|Roger, Jim.
138:10:43|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
138:10:46|T|CDR|Go ahead.
138:10:47|C|Kerwin|I know you're busy, but when Jack gets a chance, we'd like BAT C current and MAIN A voltage in the command module.
138:12:19|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
138:12:20|C|Kerwin|Go ahead,  Aquarius.
138:12:23|T|CDR|Okay. I've pitched up to about 180 degrees now, and do you want me to go to the LM SEP attitude for his alignment?
138:12:30|C|Kerwin|Stand by on that, Jim.
138:12:46|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
138:12:48|T|CDR|Go ahead.
138:12:49|C|Kerwin|Roger. We want you to go to the service module SEP attitude.
138:12:54|T|CDR|Okay.
138:12:58|C|Kerwin|And, Jim, when you have leisure to copy, I have your NOUN 46 and NOUN 47 DAP data load numbers.
138:13:08|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.
138:13:10|C|Kerwin|Okay. NOUN 46, 31021; NOUN 47, plus 25248 and plus 09050. Over.
138:13:33|T|CDR|Roger; 31021, plus 25248, plus 09050.
138:13:40|C|Kerwin|That's correct.
138:14:27|T|CDR|And now, Houston, do you still think that AGS is going to be less expensive than PGNS mode?
138:14:33|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative, Jim.
138:14:36|T|CDR|Okay. I'm in AGS pulse right now. It's the pulse ...
138:14:40|C|Kerwin|Okay. We concur.
138:14:48|T|CDR|Going back to LM SEP attitude - or CSM SEP attitude.
138:14:53|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
138:15:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston at 138 hours 15 minutes now into the mission. Apollo 13 presently 34,350 nautical miles out from Earth traveling at a speed of 10,607 feet per second. Meanwhile, in the Mission Control Center, the crowd is beginning to increase. Already here are Dr. Thomas Paine, NASA Administrator, Mr. George Low, a NASA Deputy Administrator, Representative George Miller from California and Chairman of the House Space Committee, Representative Olin Teague of Texas.
138:16:09|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
138:16:13|T|CDR|Stand by. Jack's on the line and he says that he can't get the computer to go into standby.
138:16:20|C|Kerwin|Okay. Have him tell us what he's - what he looks at. And remind him that he won't see the light. He won't see the STANDBY light  -
138:16:31|T|CMP|Okay  -
138:16:32|C|Kerwin|-  because it's not powered  -
138:16:33|T|CMP|-  Okay, Joe  -
138:16:34|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, Jack.
138:16:35|T|CMP|Joe. Okay, I get a flashing 37, I am in PROGRAM 06. There is no STANDBY light, but when I ENTER, I don't get the three balls 62 displayed like I'm supposed to.
138:16:52|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack  -
138:16:53|T|CMP|And this  -
138:16:54|C|Kerwin|Go ahead  -
138:16:55|T|CMP|-  and this occurs on both DSKYs.
138:16:58|C|Kerwin|Okay. Understand. We're - we're thinking about it. Stand by 1.
138:17:09|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack; Houston. We'd like you to go VERB 37, ENTER; 06, ENTER again. Over.
138:17:17|T|CMP|Okay. In work.
138:17:19|C|Kerwin|Okay.
138:17:45|P|PAO|Continuing with those present at the Control Center, now, are Representative Jerry Pettis of California, General Phillips, who is previously the Apollo Program Director, George Miller, also a NASA alumni and formerly Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dave Scott, Rusty Schweickart are among the astronauts in the viewing room at the present time, along with Buzz Aldrin. Dr. Elbert Hart Reese, the Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center is in the viewing room, as is Dale Myers, Associated Administrator for Manned Space Flight at present. Mr. Walter Kapriyan, Director of Launch Operations at Kennedy Space Center. Dr. Kirk Debus the Director of Kennedy Space Center is in the viewing room, as is Lew Evans, the President of Grumman.
138:18:54|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm back in the service module SEP attitude.
138:19:00|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that, Jim. Looks good. Do you know whether Jack got any pictures out of window 5? Was it still fogged up? Over.
138:19:09|T|CDR|I don't think so. I think he came right down here, because I think he saw it first in the - in the LM.
138:19:15|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good deal. And whenever you get cleaned up, we got the entry PAD and the landing area summary for you.
138:19:36|T|CMP|Okay, Vance. This is Jack.
138:19:39|C|Kerwin|Go ahead.
138:19:41|T|CMP|Okay. Doing a VERB 37, ENTER; does bring up the three balls 62 display, but I can't PROCEED on it on either DSKY and a VERB 33 doesn't work either.
138:19:55|C|Kerwin|Okay.
138:19:56|T|CMP|It's still just a flashing 5025 with a code 00062.
138:20:03|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that, Jack. Stand by 1.
138:20:20|P|PAO|Needless to say, all of the distinguished visitors in the Control Center were most interested in the report from Apollo 13 of the service module condition, as the 13 crew moved away following the jettison.
138:20:39|C|Kerwin|Jack, Houston. How long did you hold PROCEED before you quit on it?
138:20:49|T|CMP|Well, it was varying lengths. Is it suppose to be a long-time PROCEED?
138:20:56|C|Kerwin|We think it may be, Jack. We think it may be 15 to 20 seconds, and our recommendation is that you PRO and hold it down for a good period of time, probably half a minute or more, and see if the DSKY blanks.
138:21:11|T|CMP|Okay. All right, I didn't hold it in that long. Maybe 2 or 3 seconds is the longest I held it. Okay, in work.
138:21:15|C|Kerwin|Okay.
138:21:54|T|CDR|Okay, Jack just came down the tunnel again and said the computer's okay.
138:21:57|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good to hear it. And did you ever get that BAT C MAIN A reading for us?
138:22:05|T|CDR|I guess in the heat of the battle, I forgot to to give it to you, I guess. Stand by.
138:22:08|C|Kerwin|Okay.
138:22:25|T|CDR|BAT C current was 2 amps and BAT A voltage, 30.2.
138:22:30|C|Kerwin|Copy, 2 amps, 30.2. And that sounds good to us, Jim.
138:23:26|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
138:23:29|T|CDR|Go ahead.
138:23:30|C|Kerwin|Okay. We'd like to have Jack verify that the PYROs in LOGIC are SAFE, and we'd like to remind him to do no further powerup of the CSM until EI minus 2 plus 30.
138:23:44|T|CDR|Roger. He reports that the PYROs are SAFE, and we're standing by for 02:30.
138:23:48|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real good.
138:24:06|T|CDR|Well, I can't say that this week hasn't been filled with excitement.
138:24:11|C|Kerwin|Well, James, if you can't take any better care of a spacecraft than that, we might not give you another one. Hey, Jim; Houston. You might ask Jack, while he's down there, to take a peek through the telescope and tell us whether he can see any stars. Over.
138:24:34|T|CDR|Okay.
138:24:41|P|PAO|That time earlier identified at 2 hours and 30 minutes is the time in the flight plan that the command module batteries will be brought on the line. In a normal mission, the batteries would not be brought up until some 30 minutes prior to entry into the Earth's atmosphere. We show Apollo 13 presently 33,369 nautical miles away, velocity now reading 10,757 feet per second. This is Apollo Control Houston.
138:26:20|T|CDR|Joe, Jack tells me that there's still a lot of particles floating around and he's - he can't pick out any constellations that he recognizes so far. But it might clear here in a little while.
138:26:30|C|Kerwin|Okay, understand.
138:30:56|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
138:30:59|T|CDR|Go ahead.
138:31:00|C|Kerwin|Okay. EECOM is looking at that battery amperage that you gave us awhile ago. He'd like to see it about a half an amp to an amp lower. Like you to ask Jack to just check the circuit breakers and switches that he's pulled in so far and make sure he doesn't have any extra loads on MAIN A; specifically, the FLOODLIGHT configuration, and his CAUTION AND WARNING circuit breakers, and his ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER circuit breakers. Over.
138:31:35|T|CDR|Okay.
138:31:37|C|Kerwin|Thanks.
138:34:39|T|CDR|Okay. Jack reported that he turned out all the floodlights.
138:34:45|C|Mattingly|Okay. Okay, we copied that. Like to have him check the amperage on there; see what you have now, and give us a voltage reading, too.
138:35:05|T|CDR|Okay, will do.
138:35:33|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. This is Jack.
138:35:35|C|Mattingly|Go ahead.
138:35:37|T|CMP|Okay. I've been not reading any voltage at all on BAT C, and the amperage looks like about 2 amps, but that could be kind of noise-level stuff. I've got all the floodlights off and I - Can you think of anything - I could power down to lower MAIN A.
138:35:53|C|Mattingly|Okay. How about reading the voltage off of MAIN A?
138:35:57|T|CMP|Okay. Oh, this is Ken. Okay. Ken, it was 30.2.
138:36:03|C|Mattingly|Okay. We're checking out the floodlights we gave you. Actually, Jack, you ought to be able to go ahead and use the lights we gave you. There's no reason to sit in the dark. They're supposed to be coming off of MAIN B, and we're checking that now.
138:36:19|T|CMP|Okay. It's not bad down there. We're in - got plenty of light. But should I be reading the voltage on BAT C?
138:36:39|C|Mattingly|Jack, you shouldn't be reading BAT C voltage. That circuit breaker should be open.
138:36:46|T|CMP|Okay. Okay, can you think of anything else you want to get turned off to lighten load on MAIN A?
138:37:01|C|Mattingly|Okay. We're perusing that subject right now, Jack. It's really not that big a thing, just something we wanted to dress up.
138:37:11|T|CMP|Okay.
138:37:52|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston 138 hours 38 minutes into the flight -
138:37:57|C|Mattingly|Okay, Aquarius; Houston.
138:38:00|T|CDR|Go ahead.
138:38:01|C|Mattingly|Say, Jim, as something to try, you might have Jack turn off the RING 1's AUTO coils, which are probably on MAIN A. Have him turn those off and take a look at the readings.
138:38:13|T|CDR|Okay.
138:38:20|P|PAO|The Flight Dynamics Officer has just reported to Flight Director Gene Kranz that initial tracking following the mid-course burn shows that that burn was performed precisely as planned. We're at 138 hours 39 minutes into the flight, Apollo 13 now 32,012 nautical miles away with a velocity of 10,982 feet per second. This is Apollo Control Houston.
138:39:11|T|CDR|Okay. Jack has turned off RING 1 that was on MAIN A, and he's still reading 30.2 volts.
138:39:19|C|Kerwin|Roger that, Jim. What's his amperage? Did he read that off?
138:39:29|T|CDR|I guess. He says it's down in the mud; it's less than 2 amps.
138:39:32|C|Kerwin|Down in the mud. Okay, understand that. Request he turn them back on and - Okay, Jim, that's the AUTO coils back on RING 1, MAIN A, and when you get that done, I'd like you to copy the entry PAD.
138:40:25|T|CDR|Okay, Joe. Standing by to copy the entry PAD.
138:40:29|C|Kerwin|Okay, here we come. Entry pad: Mid-Pacific, 000,153; 000. The next two lines will be the GET of moonset and the Moon-check attitude; 142:38:17, 178; NOUN 61, minus 21.66, minus 165.37; 06.7; 36211, 6.51; 1168.9, 36292; 142:40:40; 00:28. The next four are N/A; D subzero is 4.00, 02:04; 00:17, 03:22, 08:14; 33, 353.1, 29.9. Boresight star is Sigma Libra, down 08.8, left 0.4; lift vector up. Comments: GDC for entry alignment, stars 31 and 23. The roll align 041, pitch 245, yaw 024, use EMS nonexit pattern. Maintain Moon-check attitude until moonset; then go to entry attitude or track horizon with the 36-degree window mark. Last comment: constant g entry is roll right. Over.
138:43:46|T|CDR|Entry pad as follows: Mid-PAC, 000, 153, 000; 142:38:17, 178; minus 21.66, minus 165.37; 06.7; 36211, 6.51; 1168.9, 36292; 142:40:40; 00:28. Next four columns are N/A; D subzero is 4.00, 02:04; 00:17, 03:22 08:14; 33, 353.1, 29.9. Zebra Libra, or something like that, Beta Libra is down 08.8, left 0.4; lift vector up; GDC entry alined, stars 31, 33. Roll 041, pitch, 045, yaw 024. EMS nonexit pattern to be used; maintain Moon check attitude until moonset, and if all else is lost, the constant g entry is right  -  Roll is right.
138:45:08|C|Kerwin|Okay. Roger that, Jim. I want to verify a couple of things I'm not sure I heard you read back. The first one was Zebra Libra (laughter) that's Sigma Libra. The set stars 31 and 23. Did you get that? Over.
138:45:27|T|CDR|Okay. No, I had 31 and 33, and I got Sigma Libra now, and it'll be 31 and 23 for the set stars.
138:45:34|C|Kerwin|Okay. And your GDC pitch align, I wasn't sure whether that was - whether you read back 245 or 045. The correct number is 245. Over.
138:45:45|T|CDR|Good show, because I have 045 down. 245.
138:45:48|C|Kerwin|Okay. And the Moon check here, unlike the horizon check, is on the 36-degree window mark all the way. Just wanted to repeat that.
138:46:08|T|CDR|Moon check on 30-degree window mark.
138:46:11|C|Kerwin|That's 36-degree window mark, Jim.
138:46:14|T|CDR|Three six. Roger.
138:46:16|C|Kerwin|Okay. Readback correct.
138:46:23|C|Kerwin|And, Aquarius; Houston. If you want me to read you the landing area summary, I'll do that.
138:46:31|T|CDR|Sounds good.
138:46:33|C|Kerwin|Okay. In the mid-Pacific landing area, the weather is good. The cloud cover is 2000, scattered; visibility, 10; winds 060 at 10; wave heights are 4 feet, and the altimeter 2986, if you care. Scattered showers less than 10 percent of the area. Recovery forces are as follows: the Iwo Jima will be at the touchdown point, the aircraft call sign will be Recovery 1, on station with swimmers on board. The - we have the constant g backup reentry area covered with the USS Hall, the Good Liberty Ship, and the other recovery aircraft whose call signs you may hear are Samoa Rescue C-130s.
138:47:31|T|CDR|Okay, fine. We have the Iwo Jima as the prime recovery ship.
138:47:34|C|Kerwin|That's correct.
138:50:37|T|CDR|Joe, Jack tells me he is still having trouble looking through the optics so I'm just going to pitch up a little bit more here to see if he can get into the dark spot.
138:50:46|C|Kerwin|Okay, real fine. You might tell him when we get to that point, we have some - some stars with corresponding shaft and trunnion angles to pass to him as backups in case the computer doesn't happen to point him straight at one. And it's the Summer Triangle.
138:51:16|T|CDR|And are you tracking us, and do you have any results on that last midcourse?
138:51:21|C|Kerwin|Stand by. It looks good. I'll try and get you numbers.
138:52:14|T|CDR|It feels nice to use the hand controller again.
138:52:19|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, Aquarius.
138:52:22|T|CDR|I just said, Joe, it feels nice to use the hand controller again.
138:52:25|C|Kerwin|Oh. Roger that. FIDO says he's got you nailed within a half a foot per second; the midcourse looked real good.
138:52:33|T|CDR|Okay.
138:52:35|C|Kerwin|And I've got two things we'd like Jack to do in the command module to ease the load on MAIN A. One of them is to verify or turn the CM/RCS HEATER switch to OFF. We're done with that, and even though the circuit breakers are pulled, the switches might be drawing a little current. And the second one is, we'd like him to turn SCS LOGIC POWER 2/3 to OFF; we don't need it now. It's called up in the checklist at the appropriate time, and we'd like him to turn that off. Over.
138:53:20|T|CDR|Okay. I'll tell Jack to check that the CM/RCS HEATER switch is off, and, if not, we'll turn it off; and also to turn off the SCS LOGIC POWER 2/3 switch, OFF, since it comes up later in the checklist.
138:53:34|C|Kerwin|That's correct.
138:53:55|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston. You heard the entry PAD being passed up to Apollo 13; this PAD based on the last midcourse; lets quickly summarize the meaning of some of those numbers. We are presently looking at splash coordinates of 21 point 66 south lattitude, 165.37 west latitude, or longitude, max g of 6.7, velocity at entry interface of 36,211 feet per second, and an entry angle of minus 6.51; time of entry interface at 142 hours, 40 minutes, 40 seconds ground elapsed time; begin blackout 17 seconds, following entry innerface, end of blackout 3 minutes, 22 seconds following entry interface, deployment of the drogue chutes at 8 minutes, 14 seconds. Our digital display now shows Apollo 13 at a distance of 30,226 nautical miles away, with a velocity of 11,290 feet per second. We are 138 hours, 56 minutes into the flight, and this is Apollo Control Houston.
138:54:14|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. We're recording MAIN A voltage up to 31.0.
138:54:19|C|Kerwin|Roger. That's 31.0. We're smiling.
138:59:10|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
138:59:11|C|Kerwin|Go, Aquarius.
138:59:14|T|CDR|Okay. How about if I hold a pitch attitude of about 115 instead of about 91. I think Jack can use the optics a little bit better at that angle.
138:59:28|C|Kerwin|Jim, that's perfectly okay with us, if it looks good for stars.
138:59:35|T|CDR|He just looked at them briefly; I'm going to have him look at them a little bit better here.
138:59:41|C|Kerwin|Okay. With the new attitude, our shaft and trunnion angles we were going to pass him don't mean anything, but it's more important to have a good star field.
139:09:45|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
139:09:48|T|CDR|Go ahead.
139:09:49|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We - We've been talking about your going to a different attitude than the PAD attitude for better star field vision out the command module, and what we'd like to have you do is this. If you can predict now or sometime soon, what attitude it is that you would like to hold at that time, and go to that attitude now, we'd like to be able to compute the coarse align gimbal angles for the CSM, and we can do that if you go to the selected attitude, hold it, call up a VERB 06 NOUN 20, and read us your LM gimbal angles, we can take those and compute CSM coarse align gimbal angles on the assumption that, when we get back into the CSM coarse align, you will return to that selected attitude. Does that sound okay? Over.
139:10:46|T|CDR|Yes. I'll try to hold the attitude we select directly, while you're giving us the coarse align attitude. We're not too sure what - what's the best attitude. I'm going to ask Jack again if 115 is sufficient for him.
139:11:02|C|Kerwin|Okay. You can take some time figuring out the best attitude, and then you won't have to hold it all the way from now until then, if you just get back to it.
139:12:58|T|CDR|Houston, Jack would like to know what constellations are in his sextant, or scanning telescope field of view at an attitude of about 105 pitch, zero roll, zero yaw. Can you give that to us?
139:13:15|C|Kerwin|Okay. We'll sure give it a go. As I said, we - We have some stars. They're not - They're not centered with the shaft and trunnion zero. Let us take a quick look at 105 pitch, shaft and trunnion zero, and see if we can get you an answer.
139:13:52|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
139:13:55|T|CDR|Go ahead.
139:13:56|C|Kerwin|Roger. These - None of these stars will be exactly centered, but, at a pitch attitude of 115, we had computed that Vega, Altair, Rasalhague, and Deneb would all be in the telescope field of view, and the first three were also in view at the 91-degree pitch, so he should be able to see one or more of those four stars. Over.
139:14:30|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you, very much.
139:14:33|C|Kerwin|Okay. And, Jim, I can give shaft and trunnions if - if he's interested.
139:14:42|T|CDR|Okay. Why don't you give us the shaft and trunion for - say, Altair at 115, and I'll go up there, and I'll see if he can pick it up.
139:14:52|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real fine, At 115 degrees of pitch, Altair, shaft 274, trunnion 22.2. Over.
139:15:08|T|CDR|Roger. Shaft is 274, trunnion 22.2.
139:15:11|C|Kerwin|That's affirm.
139:15:44|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
139:15:47|T|CDR|Go ahead, Joe.
139:15:48|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. In the LM, there we have - We show battery 3 only drawing about an amp, and we think it's probably time to get it off the line; battery 3 to OFF/RESET. Over.
139:16:10|T|CDR|Battery 3 is OFF/RESET.
139:16:12|C|Kerwin|Okay.
139:16:19|T|CDR|Just how's our power consumption, Houston, just out of curiosity?
139:16:25|C|Kerwin|I'll verify it, Jim. I'm sure it's okay.
139:16:47|C|Kerwin|Okay, Aquarius; Houston. With the present amount of power you've got in the LM, which is over 500 amp-hours, and the rate you're using them, we figure you've got almost 12 hours of power left.
139:17:04|T|CDR|Twelve hours, huh? We could reenter with it.
139:17:06|C|Kerwin|That's affirm.
139:17:15|C|Kerwin|That's enough for two touch-and-goes and a full stop, Jim.
139:17:24|T|CDR|That's right, Joe; if you could dig a crater like Cone Crater, I just might hit it.
139:17:30|C|Kerwin|(Laughter) Okay.
139:17:33|T|CDR|Jack reports that he thinks he can see Altair.
139:17:36|C|Kerwin|Very good.
139:17:40|T|CDR|He says, he thinks he can see Altair.
139:17:44|C|Kerwin|Okay. I'll take back the "very," but I'll leave the "good."
139:19:19|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston. We're now at 139 hours 19 minutes into the flight. Our digital displays show the Apollo 13 spacecraft at a distance of 27,698 nautical miles away from Earth. Velocity increasing, now reading 11,779 feet per second. As you heard the discussion earlier about LM descent battery number 3 has been taken off the line. Five batteries, including 2 in the ascent stage are now on the line. This gives almost 12 hours of light time remaining. To quickly recap what has transpired earlier, the midcourse burn number 7 was performed as scheduled at 137 hours 39 minutes 48 seconds into the flight. This was a burn of 23 seconds in duration with a DELTA-V of 3 feet per second. Our flight dynamics tracking confirms that the burn was performed precisely as planned. Command Module Pilot, Jack Swigert is now in the command module. Earlier he powered up the main BUS B, and powered up some of the equipment in his checkout process. The command module computer was verified as looking good. Service Module separation occurred a little earlier then planned. Of course, this is not a time critical event. Jim Lovell decided to separate from the service module some 8 minutes in advance of that time previously considered. We copied a separation time -
139:21:22|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
139:21:25|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go.
139:21:30|T|CDR|I ran back there to take a look and see what I could see in the - in the scanning telescope. It looks pretty grim back there right now. It might be that we have to go with the coarse align, and maybe computation of some fine align docking angles, if we have time.
139:21:46|C|Kerwin|Okay. We'd like to do that, too. Wait a minute; stand by, Jim.
139:22:08|P|PAO|We copied service module separation 138 hours 2 minutes 8 seconds ground elapsed time. Jim Lovell vividly described the condition of the service module as Apollo 13 moved away from it as having one whole side missing. Fred Haise then reported that the service propulsion system engine bell appeared damaged. Looking ahead, we plan to bring up the command module batteries 2-1/2 hours prior to entry interface some considerably in advance of what would transpire if we had a normal mission. The batteries are normally brought on the line about 30 minutes prior to entry interface. Right now our clock is counting down to lunar module jettison. And we show a time of 2 hours 17 minutes from this time. We're at 139 hours 23 minutes into the flight, and this is Apollo Control Houston.
139:23:28|C|Mattingly|Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
139:23:31|T|CDR|I read you loud and clear.
139:23:32|C|Mattingly|Okay. What we'd like to do, Jim, is - We'll go ahead and get the coarse align to the gimbal angles that - that you're going to be holding for us; and we'll get the platform up, and then when you call P52 and you use PICAPAR, it probably won't be close enough to put the star in the sextant, but if you can see any kind of a bright star in the general vicinity, - and like general vicinity, I mean 2 to 3 degrees from the center of the telescope, so that you have some clue as to which way to go, then the identification problem shouldn't present much of a - of a difficulty. And once you get the thing in the sextant, then you can go ahead and treat it like any other PICAPAR.
139:24:18|T|CDR|That sounds great, Ken. One little problem: there's all sorts of bright objects floating around us, and also that just staring at part of Aquarius; it's just reflecting light like mad. We can give it a try. There's no problem there; if we can see it, we'll get it.
139:24:38|C|Mattingly|Okay. And in - in the event that that doesn't work, we're standing by with the original scheme, a set of LM FDAI angles to fly to that'll point the command module optics at the Moon and the Sun; so we can always go back to that.
139:24:53|T|CDR|Okay.
139:25:10|C|Kerwin|And, Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to verify the SUIT RELIEF valve to closed. Over.
139:25:18|T|CDR|Stand by. It's closed.
139:25:25|C|Kerwin|Okay.
139:31:05|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
139:31:07|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go.
139:31:09|T|CDR|We'll go with your original 91-degree angle, if you have the stars figured out, and the coarse align angle for it.
139:31:18|C|Kerwin|Okay. Roger that, Jim. Then at - at your convenience here, we'd like you to go to that attitude, as close as you can get, and call up a NOUN 20 for us.
139:31:31|T|CDR|Okay. In work now.
139:31:33|C|Kerwin|Okay.
139:34:58|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
139:35:02|C|Kerwin|Go ahead, Aquarius.
139:35:05|T|CDR|Okay. I take it that, if - if Jack cannot see stars at this attitude after you give him the coarse align angles, we're just not going to read down to you our gimbal angles and have you figure out a torquing angle for Jack, but you want him to do sighting on the Moon and the Sun. Is that correct?
139:35:26|C|Kerwin|That's roughly correct, Jim. Jack will coarse align at that attitude. This is what we're having you maneuver to the - to that attitude for. We're going to compute coarse align gimbal angles and pass them up to him, and the first thing he'll do when he gets there, per his checklist, is to coarse align his platform. Then he'll go into the P52, and, if he can't see stars, we will quickly pass up to you the - your FDAI angles to put him in the Moon-view attitude, and he'll do his P52 on the Moon, and then have you maneuver on the Sun and complete the P52 of the Sun.
139:36:11|T|CDR|Okay. But I'm going to have to maneuver to the Moon to help him out.
139:36:15|C|Kerwin|Oh. That's - That's affirmative. If he can't see stars at the - at the SEP attitude that - that you'll be holding, you'll have to maneuver to the Moon attitude and then to the Sun attitude for him.
139:37:26|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
139:37:29|T|CDR|Go ahead.
139:37:30|C|Kerwin|Just like to mention that, even if, for some reason, we run out of time or something and don't complete the Moon-Sun P52, Jack will have a platform coarse align to the entry REFSMMAT, which we feel will be plenty good enough.
139:37:46|T|CDR|Roger. That's my feelings, too.
139:37:48|C|Kerwin|Okay.
139:41:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, 139 hours 42 minutes now into the flight. Apollo 13 is presently 25,227 nautical miles out from Earth, traveling at a velocity of about 12,307 feet per second. As you heard the earlier discussion, Jack Swigert having some difficulty seeing stars through the command module optics. These sightings are used as a reference in platform alignment - that's the computer platform. The problem is caused by sunlight reflecting off the surface of the lunar module and this reflection getting into the optics and washing out the view of the stars. If Command Module Pilot Swigert is unsuccessful in his star sighting efforts, Jim Lovell will maneuver with the lunar module to give him the opportunity to sight off the Sun and Moon. We're at 139 hours 42 minutes and continuing to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
139:50:45|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
139:50:49|T|CDR|Hello there, Houston.
139:50:50|C|Kerwin|Hi! Jim, we - We've gone ahead and computed the CSM coarse align gimbal angles based on your being at the service module SEP attitude at the time that Jack cranks up the computer and - and coarse aligns the IMU. That is, we assume that you're going to be at roll, 0; pitch, 091; yaw, 0; and, if you concur on that, I'd like to pass up the angles for - for Jack to have.
139:51:27|T|CDR|Okay. I'll be there to the best of my ability.
139:51:30|C|Kerwin|Good show. You ready to copy?
139:51:38|T|CDR|Go ahead.
139:51:40|C|Kerwin|Okay. CSM coarse align angles: ROLL, plus 298.95; PITCH, plus 271.30; YAW, plus 000.20.
139:52:11|T|CDR|Okay. The command module angles will be: ROLL, 298.95, PITCH, 271.30; and YAW, 000.20.
139:52:21|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative, and that's for his VERB 41 NOUN 20 when he gets there.
139:53:15|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 139 hours 53 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Our display shows this 13 spacecraft at 23,873 nautical miles now out from Earth. Less than 20 minutes from this time, Jack Swigert aboard the Command Module will start drawing power from the 3 command module entry batteries. With this event forthcoming, Flight Director, Gene Kranz, advised his flight control team on the loop to review all checklist procedures for power transfer. You may recall that yesterday the entry batteries A and B were recharged from the LM. Presently there are 118 amp hours showing for the 3 entry batteries on the Command Module, this is within 2 amp hours of the lift-off number. We're at 139 hours 55 minutes into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
139:59:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 139 hours, 59 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. We presently show Apollo 13 at 23,196 nautical miles away from Earth and with a speed of 12,798 feet per second. The retrofire officer advised the flight director, Gene Kranz, that our entry times are holding quite firm. There's only a one second change in ground elapsed time for entry interface. We're now looking at 142 hours 40 minutes 39 seconds for time of entry into the Earths atmosphere and at a velocity of 36,211 feet per second, at an entry angle of 6.5 - minus 6.5 degrees. We're at 140 hours now into the flight and this is Apollo Control, Houston.
140:00:50|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
140:00:53|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston; Aquarius here.
140:00:55|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. We're getting about 9 minutes from the commencement of command module powerup, and we wanted to just mention to you for Jack's benefit that, although the batteries are looking real good, in case they're cool and have a little difficulty hacking the load just at first, we'd like him to monitor main bus voltage to 24 volts or above during the powerup procedure and, if it falls below, we'll have a couple of circuit breakers for him that - that will solve the problem.
140:01:33|T|CDR|Okay. And I take it you're also monitoring main bus voltage.
140:01:38|C|Kerwin|Negative. Not in the command module at this time, because we don't call up telemetry until a little bit later on.
140:01:44|T|CDR|Ah so. That's right; I forgot. Okay. I will tell him.
140:01:47|C|Kerwin|Thank you.
140:09:48|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
140:09:51|T|CDR|Go ahead.
140:09:52|C|Kerwin|Okay. You're GO to start powering up the command module.
140:09:56|T|CDR|Right-o. We're starting now.
140:09:58|C|Kerwin|Okay.
140:10:32|T|LMP|Okay. We have LM power breakers.
140:11:20|T|LMP|Okay. Houston, you're looking at it.
140:11:24|C|Kerwin|Okay. Roger. Stand by.
140:11:34|C|Kerwin|Okay. Press on, Fred.
140:11:39|T|LMP|Okay.
140:12:14|T|LMP|Okay. That's - That's it, Joe.
140:12:17|C|Kerwin|Okay. Real good.
140:16:18|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston. 140 hours 16 minutes down in the flight - the network  -
140:16:23|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
140:16:26|T|CDR|Go ahead.
140:16:27|C|Kerwin|Roger. We have command module AOS. Request OMNI Charlie in the CM. Over.
140:16:33|T|CDR|OMNI Charlie. Okay. Standby.
140:16:38|P|PAO|That call up from Joe Kerwin confirming that Honeysuckle has acquisition of signal on the command module S-band. We're at 140 hours 16 minutes. Apollo 13 now 21,092 nautical miles away.
140:16:45|T|CDR|Coming up.
140:16:46|C|Kerwin|Okay.
140:16:54|T|CDR|That was sent through a new onboard communication system known as yelling through the tunnel.
140:17:00|C|Kerwin|(Laughter) The one MC.
140:17:08|T|CDR|I've got Fred up there with Jack now helping to power up the CM, and I'm staying down in good old Aquarius.
140:17:16|C|Kerwin|Understand, Jim.
140:17:45|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. We're 140 hours 18 minutes, now into the flight. That last report from spacecraft commander Jim Lovell, reporting that Fred Haise, now in the command module, helping Jack Swigert power up the systems. The nominal timeline called for Lovell and Haise is to transfer into the lunar module at about minus 1 hour 30 minutes from time of entry interface. So lunar module pilot, Haise has stepped ahead slightly in that timeline. We now show that we're 1 hour 22 minutes away from time of jettison of the lunar module. With 140 hours 19 minutes into the flight, this is Apollo Control Houston.
140:21:02|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston at 140 hours 21 minutes now into the flight. We're receiving command module tracking data now and the data is looking good.
140:21:13|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
140:21:16|T|CDR|Go ahead.
140:21:17|C|Kerwin|Just to inform you. We've got data from the - from Odyssey, and it looks good.
140:21:22|T|CDR|Hey, great.
140:21:30|P|PAO|However, in looking over some of the command module displays it appears -
140:21:33|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius. Odyssey is trying to call. Can you read them?
140:21:36|C|Kerwin|Negative. Don't read Odyssey yet; has he got his intercom panel configured?
140:21:45|T|CDR|I'll doublecheck. They're hearing you.
140:21:49|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good deal. I don't hear him, yet.
140:21:56|P|PAO|It appears to be a little chilly inside the command module cabin at the present time. We have a reading of 38 degrees.
140:22:01|T|CDR|Are you ready for an E-MEMORY dump, VERB 74?
140:22:07|C|Kerwin|Stand by for just 1 minute, Jim.
140:22:42|T|CDR|We've got a lot of things to do, Houston.
140:22:45|C|Kerwin|I know it. Okay, Aquarius; Houston. Recommend in Odyssey that he switch the POWER AMPLIFIER to LOW. Over.
140:22:54|T|CDR|POWER AMPLIFIER to LOW.
140:23:02|T|CDR|It's been switched to LOW, Houston.
140:23:05|C|Kerwin|Roger. Okay. Verify the POWER AMP talkback is gray, Jim.
140:23:13|T|CDR|Okay. That's verified.
140:23:24|C|Kerwin|Okay.
140:23:34|P|PAO|We're at 140 hours 23 minutes now into the flight. We presently show Apollo 13 at 20,257 nautical miles away and having a velocity of 13,622 feet per second. This is Apollo Control Houston.
140:24:13|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
140:24:15|T|CDR|Go ahead.
140:24:16|C|Kerwin|We have high bit rate; we are standing by for the VERB 74 ENTER and the E-MOD dump.
140:24:22|T|CDR|Roger. Thank you.
140:24:24|T|CMP|Joe, how do you read?
140:24:26|C|Kerwin|Okay. Read you, babe.
140:24:29|T|CMP|Okay, Loud and clear. VERB 74 coming down.
140:24:39|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that, Jack.
140:24:43|T|CMP|And I'll be ready for your P27 update.
140:24:47|C|Kerwin|Okay.
140:24:51|T|CMP|And I'm in ACCEPT,
140:24:54|C|Kerwin|Okay. Understand you are in P00 and ACCEPT. Verify OMNI Charlie.
140:25:04|T|CMP|Okay. Joe, we are OMNI Charlie. We have little bit better signal strength on another OMNI.
140:25:10|C|Kerwin|Okay. Stand by.
140:25:23|C|Kerwin|Okay, Odyssey; Houston. Select your own best OMNI and then repeat VERB 74 ENTER. Over.
140:26:50|C|Kerwin|Okay, Odyssey; Houston. We are locked on solid high bit rate now; repeat the VERB 74 ENTER. Over. Belay that; hold the VERB 74 1 minute. Wait.
140:27:02|T|CMP|You're too late, Joe; it's coming down.
140:27:31|C|Kerwin|Okay, Odyssey, Houston.
140:27:36|T|CMP|Go ahead.
140:27:37|C|Kerwin|Okay. We are going to skip the E-MOD dump for right now and get the uplink in.
140:27:43|T|CMP|Okay. P00 and ACCEPT.
140:27:44|C|Kerwin|Okay. P00 and ACCEPT. And, Jack, you can go ahead with the IMU and optics powerup. Over.
140:27:54|T|CMP|Roger. It's in work.
140:27:56|C|Kerwin|Okay.
140:33:35|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston 140 hours 34 minutes now into the flight. We're presently in the process of updating the command module computer, the CMC now in program 27. We show 1 hour 7 minutes away from scheduled time of jettison of the lunar module. This Apollo Control Houston.
140:35:13|T|CMP|We ... unable to read any BAT B voltage. We do have current, though, on BAT B.
140:35:25|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that, Fred.
140:35:28|T|LMP|Well, it's Jack.
140:35:38|C|Kerwin|You're looking good on the ground, Odyssey.
140:35:41|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
140:35:45|C|Kerwin|And I think the reason you don't read voltage is that it's a circuit breaker that we have called as being out.
140:35:53|T|CMP|All right. Real fine.
140:36:31|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston now 140 hours 37 minutes now into the flight. We presently show Apollo 13 at 18,623 nautical miles from Earth and with a velocity of 14,144 feet per second. This is Apollo Control.
140:36:56|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston. The uplink is going well. We have one more load to get in.
140:37:02|T|CMP|Okay. Real fine.
140:39:09|T|CMP|Is the computer mine now, Joe?
140:39:12|C|Kerwin|Standby one second.
140:39:16|T|CMP|Okay.
140:40:01|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. We'd like the VERB 74 ENTER, and it'll take less than a minute for E-MOD dump.
140:40:10|T|CMP|Coming down.
140:40:20|C|Kerwin|And, Jack, Houston. It'll be 100 seconds on that.
140:40:26|T|CMP|Okay. Can I go to BLOCK on the UP TELEMETRY?
140:40:29|C|Kerwin|Aah - not not just yet, Jack.
140:40:55|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston. You can go to UP TEL BLOCK. Over.
140:41:01|T|CMP|UP TEL BLOCK and the computer is mine.
140:41:03|C|Kerwin|Not yet, Jack. We're still in the E-MOD dump. And, Aquarius, Houston -
140:41:07|T|CMP|Okay.
140:41:14|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
140:41:16|C|Kerwin|Okay. We're coming up on time for the coarse align, Jim, so you can hold your attitude real good.
140:41:23|T|CDR|Rog.
140:41:25|C|Kerwin|And, Odyssey, Houston. The computer is yours. You can press on.
140:41:30|T|CMP|Okay.
140:43:13|T|CDR|Houston, Aquarius.
140:43:17|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
140:43:18|T|CDR|Roger. He just did the coarse align. I'm going to the jettison attitude.
140:43:23|C|Kerwin|Copy that.
140:43:37|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. I copied that you - that he's completed the coarse align; he's going into the P52 now? Is that right?
140:43:54|T|CDR|Let me check. I think he is.
140:43:56|C|Kerwin|Okay. You're staying at your present attitude, aren't you?
140:44:03|T|CDR|Yeah. We'll - I'll stay in the present attitude.
140:44:05|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
140:44:26|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. I got a 220 alarm here. Ah, standby.
140:44:34|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
140:44:37|T|CMP|...
140:44:55|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston. Have you set the drift flag and the REFSMMAT flag Over.
140:45:07|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston.
140:45:12|T|CMP|... flag.
140:45:15|C|Kerwin|You were noisy; I didn't copy. Have you set the drift and REFSMMAT flag?
140:45:25|P|PAO|Jack Swigert reported a 220 alarm, this indicating that the IMU is not aligned. We're at 140 hours 45 minutes into the flight. We show Apollo 13 at 17,461 nautical miles away at the present, now traveling at a speed of 14,552 feet per second.
140:46:16|P|PAO|Apollo 13 now 54 minutes away from the time of lunar module jettison. To dispose of Aquarius, the crew inside the command module after installing the hatch will vent the lunar module tunnel to 1-1/2 or 2 pounds giving a DELTA pressure of 3 psi across the docking tunnel hacth. This to insure a proper sealing. To jettison the lunar module the pyros are fired aboard the command module and pressure in the tunnell gives a separation velocity of some 2 feet per second. The command module will do most of the moving at this point because it will be the lighter of the 2 spacecraft. Separation could be likened to the releasing of a balloon and having air propel it along. We're at 140 hours 47 minutes now into the flight and Apollo 13 now at a distance of 17,225 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 14,629 feet per second. This is Apollo Control Houston.
140:48:04|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. I don't have a star in the sextant. I'm going to hunt for it in a minute.
140:48:09|C|Kerwin|Roger that, Jack.
140:49:23|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. Can you give me any stars that I might try here?
140:49:28|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative. Vega and Altair should be good. Vega is 36, Altair is 40.
140:49:36|T|CMP|Okay. We'll give that a try
140:49:38|C|Kerwin|Okay. And you might look for them in the telescope if they're not in the sextant right off. They should be close to the crosshairs.
140:49:45|T|CMP|Okay. I got all that material that's venting from the bottom of the command module.
140:49:53|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
140:52:07|T|CDR|I have an RCS light, Houston.
140:52:16|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. That's the one we warned you about some time ago. Low helium; no sweat.
140:52:22|T|CDR|Oh, okay.
140:52:39|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. There's a star angle difference with stars 36 and 40.
140:52:46|C|Kerwin|How about that, baby!
140:52:49|T|CDR|And I'm maneuvering, Houston.
140:52:50|T|CMP|Okay -  ... Okay.
140:52:52|C|Kerwin|Roger that. Copy you're maneuvering to the LM JETT attitude. Is that right?
140:52:58|T|CMP|That's affirm  -
140:52:59|T|CDR|That's affirm.
140:53:00|T|CMP|I'm going to torque those gimbal angles.
140:53:03|C|Kerwin|Torque them, babe.
140:53:07|T|CMP|There it is. Okay. I'll do a star check.
140:53:10|C|Kerwin|Okay.
140:53:27|C|Kerwin|Okay, Odyssey. You're suddenly ahead of the timeline.
140:53:53|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston. Request OMNI Bravo.
140:54:06|T|LMP|I am OMNI Bravo, Joe.
140:54:08|C|Kerwin|Okay.
140:54:18|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. The sextant star check passes.
140:54:25|C|Kerwin|Say again, Jack.
140:54:28|T|CMP|I did a star check, and it passes. It puts that star right in the telescope.
140:54:35|C|Kerwin|Good enough. You can press on in the checklist, Jack.
140:54:56|C|Kerwin|Mind out LM gimbal lock, Jim.
140:54:59|T|CDR|It's the command module's gimbal lock I'm worried about.
140:55:02|C|Kerwin|(Laughter) Okay.
140:55:09|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston. 140 hours, 55 minutes into the flight; that star check report confirms proper alignment of the command module platform. We are 45 minutes away now from scheduled time of LM jettison.
140:55:28|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
140:55:30|T|CDR|Go ahead.
140:55:31|C|Kerwin|Roger. If you concur, we would be inclined to recommend that you go to AGS for the maneuver because you'll have to be there later on anyway.
140:55:41|T|CDR|Okay.
140:55:43|C|Kerwin|And AGS PULSE is the recommendation.
140:55:46|T|CDR|We're having trouble maneuvering, Joe, without getting it in gimbal lock.
140:55:50|C|Kerwin|Okay. You can  -
140:55:51|T|CDR|You picked a lousy attitude, though, to separate.
140:55:55|C|Kerwin|Well, we apologize. Just take your time. Jim, we've got time now.
140:56:01|T|CDR|Okay.
140:56:28|T|CDR|Uh, Houston, why can't I stay in PGNS ATT HOLD for the LM attitude hold?
140:56:38|C|Kerwin|Stand by on that, Jim.
140:57:34|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Over.
140:57:36|T|CDR|Go ahead.
140:57:38|C|Kerwin|Okay. Our recommendation is that you stay in AGS for the LM JETT simply because we've thought it through. We've got the right deadbands and all set up. Over.
140:57:49|T|CDR|Okay. It's a lot easier for me to maneuver in PGNS, Joe, than it is AGS.
140:57:56|C|Kerwin|Yes. You can maneuver in PGNS, Jim. I'm sorry, I thought you were talking about the ATT HOLD and the LM JETT afterward. You can maneuver in PGNS if you want to.
140:58:10|P|PAO|Apollo Control, 140 hours, 58 minutes, Apollo 13 now 15,786 nautical miles away. Velocity now reading 15,192 feet per second.
140:58:22|T|CDR|I want to get way over here, Joe. To prevent him into gimbal lock, I have the yaw at about - I'd say about almost 50 degrees.
140:58:35|C|Kerwin|Roger that. Just stay out of gimbal lock and that 45-degree isn't critical - the out of plane, that is.
140:59:05|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston. Request OMNI Charlie.
140:59:10|T|CMP|Okay. Going OMNI Charlie.
140:59:11|C|Kerwin|Thank you.
140:59:12|T|LMP|We're there.
140:59:13|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good.
141:00:28|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston.
141:00:31|T|CDR|Go ahead.
141:00:32|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. The particular DAP configuration we have set up now is using more fuel than we'd like out of system B. We'd like you to reconfigure the DAP to 30021. Over.
141:00:57|C|Kerwin|Thank you.
141:01:35|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston.
141:01:38|T|CMP|Go ahead.
141:01:39|C|Kerwin|We'd like to have you turn the optics power off until you need them again, and we would like to have you check the RCS ring 1 and 2 temps for us. Over.
141:01:52|T|CMP|Optics power going off.
141:01:54|C|Kerwin|Okay.
141:02:05|T|LMP|Okay, Joe. Our ring 1 is 50; ring 2 is plus 42.
141:02:09|C|Kerwin|Ring 1 is 50; copy. What was the other?
141:02:13|T|LMP|42.
141:02:15|C|Kerwin|Got it. Thank you.
141:02:22|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I am at the LM SEP attitude and I'm planning on bailing out.
141:02:32|C|Kerwin|Okay. I can't think of a better idea, Jim.
141:02:36|T|CDR|I'll go to AGS ATT HOLD, if you want me to.
141:02:40|C|Kerwin|We recommend that, Jim.
141:02:54|C|Kerwin|Okay, Aquarius; Houston. In AGS ATT HOLD, we recommend WIDE DEADBAND. Over.
141:03:01|T|CDR|I'm in the AGS DEADBAND.
141:03:04|C|Kerwin|Roger.
141:03:35|C|Kerwin|Aquarius, Houston. Don't forget the ...
141:03:53|T|LMP|You need to relay something downstairs, Joe?
141:04:00|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston.
141:04:03|T|LMP|Go ahead, Joe.
141:04:04|C|Kerwin|Okay. Our troops would like to have you go to the SYSTEMS TEST METER and read out the injector temps on RCS for us.
141:04:12|T|LMP|Okay. Okay. In work.
141:04:49|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Let me read out the injector temperatures for you.
141:04:53|C|Kerwin|Go ahead.
141:04:57|T|CMP|5 Charlie, 4.2; 5 Dogs 4.6; 6 Alfa, 4.3; 6 Bravo, 4.3; 6 Charlie, 3.6; 6 Dog, 3.6.
141:05:19|C|Kerwin|Okay. Copy that. No complaints.
141:05:32|T|CMP|Okay. We're ready to proceed with hatch closeout.
141:05:35|C|Kerwin|Okay. Did Jim get the film out of Aquarius?
141:05:43|T|CMP|Yes. We - You mean the film we took this morning?
141:05:46|C|Kerwin|That's affirm.
141:05:48|T|CMP|Yes, We've transferred that.
141:05:50|C|Kerwin|Okay. Good deal. Jack, let me mention something about the hatch integrity check. You're going to vent the tunnel until you get a 3-psi DELTA-P. That should take 9 or 10 minutes, and it's our firm feeling that you don't have to wait another 10 minutes after that for a leak check. If it holds pressure for a minute or so or even gets down there, you know you've got a good hatch. Over.
141:06:16|T|CMP|Okay. Copy that.
141:06:18|C|Kerwin|Okay.
141:07:37|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. 141 hours 8 minutes now into the flight. Apollo 13 presently 14,468 nautical miles out from Earth. All three crewmen now in the command module preparing to install the hatch. We show 32 minutes 40 seconds away from scheduled time of lunar module jettison. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
141:10:43|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, now 141 hours 11 minutes now into the mission; it's less than 30 minutes away from the scheduled time of jettisoning the lunar module. We show Apollo 13 at an altitude of 14,020 nautical miles. We have an estimate of an altitude of 9,729 nautical miles at the time of jettisoning the lunar module. We're at 141 hours 11 minutes continuing to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
141:12:42|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. We've got an O2 FLOW HIGH.
141:12:47|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack, are you  -
141:12:53|T|CMP|Well, we might be pressurizing a lot of the system that was not pressurized.
141:12:59|C|Kerwin|Roger. I expect that's the case. Let us check it.
141:13:04|T|CMP|Okay. Take a good look at CABIN.
141:13:07|C|Kerwin|Will do.
141:13:28|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston. Just verify your DIRECT O2 is OFF. Over.
141:13:37|T|CMP|Yes, sir. That is verified.
141:13:38|C|Kerwin|Okay, and  -
141:13:39|T|CDR|... it's dropping now, Joe.
141:13:43|C|Kerwin|Roger. We think that you were just pressurizing the cabin up to that regulator's particular SPEC.
141:15:14|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston.
141:15:17|T|CMP|Go ahead.
141:15:18|T|CDR|Go ahead.
141:15:19|C|Kerwin|Okay. We're observing middle gimbal angle getting a little bit high. The LM appears to be deadbanding okay within its attitude, but just wanted you to know that we're keeping an eye on it and if it does get too high, we might want you to punch off early.
141:15:32|T|CMP|Okay.
141:15:36|C|Kerwin|And verify that the hatch is secured and that you are venting the tunnel. Over.
141:15:42|T|CMP|That's verified. We have a DELTA-P of 2.8.
141:15:46|C|Kerwin|Real good. Real good.
141:16:09|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston at 141 hours 16 minutes into the flight. Apollo 13 now 13,283 nautical miles away from Earth with a velocity building up now to 16,350 feet per second.
141:16:27|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. Since we're ahead of the timeline, can I proceed on and kind of punch off early, or do you want me to punch off at exactly 1 hour?
141:16:35|C|Kerwin|Jack, when you are comfortably ready to punch off, you can go ahead and do it.
141:16:40|T|CMP|Okay.
141:16:45|P|PAO|That was Jack Swigert receiving that confirmation from the ground from Joe Kerwin that he can jettison the lunar module at his convenience. So we'll stand by for that possibility at any time. We're at 141 hours 17 minutes into the flight of Apollo 13.
141:17:49|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston. We just had a formal GO for LM JETT at your convenience. Over.
141:17:57|T|CMP|Okay. Thanks, Joe.
141:17:58|C|Kerwin|Okay.
141:18:25|C|Kerwin|Okay, Odyssey; Houston. We're ready for you to bring the BMAGs ON and WARM UP and all other things being equal, we'd like you to go through the LM JETT at - on the checklist you've got. And that is BMAGs 1  -
141:18:38|T|CMP|Okay. Will do.
141:18:40|C|Kerwin|-  1. That's BMAG 1 now, as you know.
141:18:45|T|CMP|Yes, BMAG 1 is in WARM UP.
141:18:47|C|Kerwin|Good deal.
141:19:45|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston, 141 hours 20 minutes now into the flight. While we're standing by we'll pass along some updated numbers from the retro fire officer. We show time of entry into the Earth's atmosphere at 142 hours, 40 minutes, 39 seconds, blackout begins at plus 18 seconds from time of entry interface -
141:20:17|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Do you have a command module weight for me?
141:20:24|C|Kerwin|Stand by 1, Jack.
141:20:33|P|PAO|Blackout ends at 3 minutes 23 seconds from time of entry interface.
141:20:43|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston.
141:20:47|T|CMP|Go ahead.
141:20:48|C|Kerwin|Okay. I'm reminded that the entry DAP is all you've got. It'll initialize itself, and you won't have an - you won't have an RCS DAP, so you don't have to fool with it.
141:20:59|T|CMP|Okay.
141:21:04|P|PAO|Drogue deploys at 8 minutes 16 seconds, main chutes deploy at 9 minutes 4 seconds from time of entry interface, predicted time of splash 14 minutes 1 second from time of entry interface. Standing by, continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control Houston.
141:21:44|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston, now 141 hours 22 minutes into the flight. We show Apollo 13 presently at an altitude of 12,474 nautical miles at a speed of 16,761 feet per second.
141:22:12|T|CMP|Okay, Joe. I'm - Have you got your checklist out there on the SCS powerup?
141:22:17|C|Kerwin|That's affirm.
141:22:19|T|CMP|Okay. I'm coming down here to a step that says FDAI POWER, off. Is that what you want right now, I guess, huh?
141:22:29|C|Mattingly|Okay, Jack. That FDAI POWER, OFF, is to stop momentary glitches as you bring up the BMAG to put it on, and you turn right around and put the FDAI POWER right back on 1.
141:22:44|T|CMP|Okay. And I don't have the BMAG TEMP light out yet. Do you want me to go ahead and put the BMAG ON with the TEMP light still ON?
141:22:50|C|Mattingly|That's affirm. We can go ahead and you'll have a good stable rate.
141:22:55|T|CMP|All right. Let's do it.
141:24:09|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston 141 hours 24 minutes now into the flight. The flight surgeons now monitoring the consoles are taking readings on Jack Swigert and Fred Haise's heart rates on these gentlemen just running over 100, slightly higher than average indicating an increased work load. We now show Apollo 13 at 12,064 nautical miles away from Earth, speed continuing to build up, now reading 16,989 feet per second. This is Apollo Control Houston.
141:26:38|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. We'll punch off at 141 plus 30.
141:26:43|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. We copy and we concur.
141:26:55|P|PAO|That was Jack Swigert indicating that they plan to jettison the lunar module in about 3 minutes from this time.
141:27:43|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston 141 hours 28 minutes into the flight, Apollo 13 now 11,590 nautical miles away from Earth. For reentry the 3 crewmen will be traveling in shirt sleeve environment, not in their space suits. We're standing by now for reports of jettison of the lunar module. At 141 hours 28 minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.
141:28:21|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Do we have a go for PYRO ARM?
141:28:34|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston. We can give you a GO if you'll put the LOGIC ON momentarily for us.
141:28:41|T|CMP|Okay. The SECS LOGIC is on.
141:28:42|C|Kerwin|Okay. Just copied that, and you are GO for PYRO ARM.
141:28:46|T|CMP|Real fine.
141:29:51|T|CMP|10 seconds.
141:29:56|T|CDR|5 -
141:30:03|T|CDR|LM jettison.
141:30:05|C|Kerwin|Okay, copy that. Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you.
141:30:21|C|Kerwin|Watch gimbal lock there, Jack.
141:30:24|T|CMP|Yeah, we did.
141:30:44|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston at 141 hours, 31 minutes into the flight; we have had lunar module jettison, and for Apollo 13, the age of Aquarius ended at 141 hours, 30 minutes ground elapsed time.
141:31:52|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston. Request OMNI Bravo.
141:34:46|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. 141 hours 35 minutes now into the flight. We have a report from recovery that Samoa rescue Aircraft 1, 3 and 4 are now enroute to their respective stations. These C-130 aircraft. Samoa 1 will be positioned 105 nautical miles uprange. Samoa 4, 200 nautical miles downrange. Correction to that last report Samoa 1 will be 345 nautical miles uprange. Samoa 2, 240 nautical miles uprange. Samoa 4, 200 nautical miles downrange. Continue to monitor at 141 hours 36 minutes. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
141:36:03|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston.
141:36:05|T|CMP|Go ahead.
141:36:06|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. We'll have a PAD for you in a few minutes. We're getting data now on the tracking, and although we suspect the changes from your preliminary PAD will be very small, we recommend that you hold off on initializing the EMS until we get you the final PAD. Over.
141:36:23|T|CMP|Okay. Will do.
141:36:25|C|Kerwin|Roger.
141:37:20|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. The sextant star check passes.
141:37:23|C|Kerwin|Houston, copy. Good show. That was some P52, Jack.
141:37:35|T|CMP|Yes. I was kind of lucky, I guess.
141:37:41|C|Kerwin|Give you a big gold star for that.
141:37:44|T|CMP|Thank you.
141:38:15|T|CMP|Hey, Joe. We're standing by to copy your new PAD.
141:38:18|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. It'll be a few minutes yet. We want to get it right up to speed.
141:38:43|T|CMP|Okay. I can proceed with EMS check, can't I, Joe?
141:38:46|C|Kerwin|That's affirmative, Jack. You can go ahead with that.
141:39:58|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control Houston. 141 hours 40 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Apollo 13 now at an altitude of 9,703 nautical miles from Earth with a velocity now reading 18,504 feet per second. We have a report that the lunar module is continuing to hold altitude the way it should. Cabin pressure is holding and here in Mission Control we'll continue to track the lunar module, Aquarius until it reenters. We're at 141 hours 41 minutes into the flight, and this is Apollo Control Houston.

141:48:23|C|Kerwin|Okay. Mid-PAC, 000,152, 000; 142:38:19, 178; and you recall that's GET moonset and Moon-check attitude. NOUN 61, minus 21.66, minus 165.37; 05.2; 36211, 6.20; 11197, 36291; 142:40:46; 00:30; the next four are N/A; D zero is 4.00, 02:20; 00:19, 03:38, 07:59. The rest of the pad is N/A for this one. You are lift vector up at the very bottom. And the remarks all remain the same; if you want me to copy them, let me know; otherwise, you can read back. Over.
141:50:02|T|CDR|Okay. Entry pad as follows: Mid-PAC, 000,152, 000; 142:38:19, 178; minus 21.66, minus 165.37; 05.2; 36211, 6.20; 11197, 36291; 142:40:46; 00:30; all the DLs are N/A. D0 is 4.00, 02:20; 00:19, 03:38, 07:59. All the rest are N/A, except lift vector which is up; and I have the the ...
141:50:51|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jim. That's a tiny hair shallower than we had you before, but it's based on solid tracking, and it still is lift vector up comfortably.
141:51:06|T|CDR|Roger. We never did bring that angle up, did we?
141:51:12|C|Kerwin|No, actually, we didn't.
141:53:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, now 141 hours 53 minutes now into the flight. Our final pad shows a time of entry interface at 142 hours 40 minutes 46 seconds; begin blackout at plus 19 seconds from time of entry interface, end the blackout, 3 minutes and 38 seconds. Time of drogue deploy from entry interface is plus 7 minutes and 59 seconds; main chute deployment plus 8 minutes 46 seconds from time of entry interface and predicted time of splash, 13 minutes 44 seconds from time of entry interface.

We show Apollo 13 at an altitude of 6,613 nautical miles away, velocity really beginning to build up now, now reading 21,227 feet per second. We show 40 minutes from time of reentry into the Earth's atmosphere.
142:00:42|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston. Over.
142:00:44|T|CMP|Go ahead.
142:00:45|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. We'd like P00 and ACCEPT for your final state vector.
142:00:55|T|CDR|You've got it.
142:01:04|C|Kerwin|And, Odyssey, Houston. We're also sending you a final PIPA bias update and clock increment. Over.
142:01:12|T|CDR|Okay. Fine; thank you, Joe. How does the LM look? Are you still tracking it?
142:01:17|C|Kerwin|All I've heard was that it's - that the cabin was holding pressure. I haven't heard anything more. And, Odyssey, we're ready for you to warm up the BMAG number 2's at your discretion and we're curious whether the Moon check attitude is good. Over.
142:01:43|T|CMP|Yes, Joe, it's coming down. I guess it's about 45 degrees now and it's coming on down.
142:01:50|C|Kerwin|Roger that.
142:03:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 142 hours 3 minutes now into the flight. We presently show on one of our displays a splash coordinance of 21 degrees 39 minutes South. 165 degrees, 23 minutes West. Apollo 13 now at an altitude of 5,862 nautical miles. Velocity now reading 22,085 feet per second.
142:06:12|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston. The computer is yours. Over.

142:06:25|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston - 142 hours 7 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Odyssey now 34 minutes away from time of entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Mission Control has just passed a computer update to the onboard CMC and as you heard Joe Kerwin's last report to the crew, telling them that the computer now belongs to them. We're at 142 hours 7 minutes, continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control.
142:07:04|T|CMP|Joe. The Moon is coming down to about 38 degrees.
142:07:10|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack. Sounds real good.
142:07:40|P|PAO|Apollo Control at 142 hours, 8 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Presently 5,134 nautical miles away from Earth. Velocity now reading 23,023 feet per second. We're 33 minutes away from time of entry. This is Apollo Control, Houston.
142:09:01|C|Kerwin|Odyssey, Houston.
142:09:03|T|CDR|Go ahead.
142:09:04|C|Kerwin|Okay. We'd like the S-BAND POWER AMPLIFIER to OFF, center, at this time, Jim.
142:09:11|T|CDR|OFF, center, and it's there.
142:09:14|C|Kerwin|Okay. You're still looking real fat on power. We show you having over 30 amps on the water. If you do get into a bind and don't come up - that's amp-hours - don't come up with Recovery, you can always power down and you can always put the pyro batteries on the line if you need them after you're down.
142:09:35|T|CDR|Okay.
142:13:40|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. 142 hours 14 minutes now into the mission. Apollo 13 presently 4,075 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity now showing 24,619 feet per second. We're less than 27 minutes now from time of entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
142:16:57|P|PAO|Apollo Control Houston, 142 hours, 17 minutes now into the mission - our digital display at present shows Apollo 13 at 3,505 nautical miles away from Earth, now travelingat a speed of 25,693 feet per second. Jack Swigert confirms that the EMS check went well, which provides a good backup monitor for checking the guidance and navigation system performance; we are at 142 hours, 18 minutes into the flight, and this is Apollo Control Houston.
142:17:54|T|CMP|Joe, are you planning to run this all the way down without the suit compressor?
142:18:00|C|Kerwin|Say again, Jack.
142:18:02|T|CMP|Are you planning to turn on the suit compressor at all on the way down?
142:18:07|C|Kerwin|That's negative Jack; I'll verify it; but I sure don't think so.
142:18:11|T|CMP|Okay, that's all right with us.
142:18:22|C|Kerwin|Okay, Jack, this is Houston, we've got power, and you can cycle it for 10 minutes if you so desire, but we don't think you need to do it. Over.
142:18:31|T|CMP|Okay, we'll hold that.
142:18:33|C|Kerwin|Okay, real fine. How did the EMS check go, Jack?
142:18:36|T|CMP|EMS checked out okay  -
142:18:39|C|Kerwin|Good deal.

142:40:47|P|PAO|Apollo 13 should have entered the Earth's atmosphere at this time. A few moments ago, we had a report from the retrofire officer that based on his data, a predicted set of coordiance for splash of 21 degrees 39 minutes south of 165 degrees 22 minutes west. The period of blackout for the spacecraft should have begun about 20 some odd seconds ago.
142:42:09|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston. Apollo 13 should be coming up on max g right now. Our last estimate for max g was 5.2 g's.
142:42:58|P|PAO|We have about a minute and a half to go during this period of blackout. Here in Mission Control the scene from the recovery ship Iwo Jima has been flashed up on one or our large screens for all our flight controllers to watch. We have about 1 minute to go now to time of end of blackout.
142:43:59|P|PAO|About 30 seconds to go for blackout.
142:44:19|P|PAO|Less than 10 seconds now. We will attempt to contact Apollo 13 through one of the ARIA aircraft. Continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control Houston.
142:44:48|P|PAO|Apollo 13 should be out of blackout at this time. We are standing by for any reports of ARIA acquisition, ARIA a C-135 type aircraft.
142:45:35|P|PAO|Coming up now on 3 minutes until time of drogue deployment, standing by for any reports of acquisition.

143:04:41|C|Recovery|Roger 13; this Recovery; do you have a LAT/LONG and some ranges to go for me, over ?
143:04:50|T|CMP|No sir; we closed the display, and were hoping Houston would copy it; we didn't read it out over the air.
143:04:57|C|Recovery|Thank you sir. Recovery; roger out.
143:05:01|T|CMP|Could you give us our distance to the ship?
143:05:03|C|Recovery|This is Recovery. Your present distance from the ship 1 mile, bearing 300 to the ship; you're splash down point 3 - 3 miles from Iwo Jima.
143:05:18|T|CMP|Thank you.
143:05:21|C|Photo 1|This is Photo 1; the sea anchor has been attached, observe a thumbs up from the swimmer.
143:05:29|C|Recovery|Swim 2, This is Recovery. You are clear to deploy two swimmers and the flotation collar; over.
143:05:36|C|Swim 2|Roger, roger.
143:05:38|P|PAO|The sea anchor attached to a pad eye on the side of the Apollo 13 command module.
143:05:46|C|Photo 1|This is Photo 1. Swimmer is in; getting thumbs up. Everything progressing satisfactorily.
143:05:53|P|PAO|This done to slow down the drift.
143:05:53|C|Photo 1|The sea anchor appears to be holding nicely; has oriented the command module in the customary manner.
143:06:19|C|Photo 1|Swim 2 is moving in to deploy the flotation collar and two additional swimmers. Swim 1 has deployed a smoke in the area, and is attempting to retrieve the accessories.
143:06:43|C|Photo 1|Swim 1 has deployed a swimmer in the water. Swim 2 has deployed 2 swimmers. I see a thumbs up, and the flotation collar is deployed.
143:06:58|C|Photo 1|The uprighting bags are inflated approximately 90 percent at this time. The swimmers are working the flotation collar in to the command module.
143:07:33|C|Photo 1|The flotation collar is at the command module; the front seat is bein extracted, and it is being pulled around the command module.
143:07:46|P|PAO|The flotation collar will be pulled around the command module with a bungee cord.
143:08:07|C|Photo 1|One section of the bungee is being attached to the sea anchor attachment ring. It appears to be satisfactorily connected. The second section of the bungee is approximately 90 percent around the command module.
143:08:27|P|PAO|The flotation collar will be hooked to a bungee line, by a line with rings on the flotation collar, and will be pulled around before it is inflated.
143:08:30|C|Photo 1|And the bungee appears to be firmly attached.
143:08:37|C|Photo 1|Deployment of the inflation collar has commenced. It is approximately 20 percent around the command module.
143:08:59|C|Photo 1|The flotation collar is approximately 60 percent deployed around the command module
143:09:10|C|Photo 1|There is no apparent drift of the command module at this time.
143:09:25|P|PAO|And after the collar is secured the two 7-man life rafts will be dropped with sea anchors attached to the bottom. This is done to keep the rafts from turning over from helicopter backwash.

143:38:57|C|Paine|This is doctor Paine speaking. I'd like to pass a message to all hands of Mission Control that has just come in to me from the president of the United States. He wishes to tell all of you as number 66 comes in to final approach, tremendous appreciation that he has, and the entire nation has for the wonderful teamwork that you have shown here in mission control, and to give you a hearty "well done".
143:39:00|C|Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima, this is Samoa Rescue 1.
143:40:11|C|Iwo Jima|... winds 10 starboard, at 12.
143:40:15|C|Recovery|Roger out.
143:40:38|C|Swim 2|This is swim lead, over.
143:40:40|P|PAO|The applause you just heard in the Mission Control Center came from a message delivered by Administrator Thomas Paine over the flight director's loop congratulating - from the President of the United States congratulating the team of Apollo 13.
143:40:52|C|Swim 2|... swim lead, over.
143:41:01|C|Swim 1|... Swim 1. Over.

143:42:00|T|CDR|Glad to be aboard again.
143:42:09|C|Davidson|I want to say not just for the recovery forces but for millions and millions of people from all over the world. Undoutably has to be one of the most, universally happy moments. We're glad you could make it, boys.
143:42:30|C|Iwo Jima|I want to commend you on your navigation. Welcome onboard Iwo Jima.
143:42:36|C|Iwo Jima|I would like to ask the Chaplain to say a real brief prayer of thanks.
143:42:42|C|Jerauld|Let us pray. Oh Lord, we joyfully welcome back to Earth astronauts Lovell, Haise, and Swigert. Who by your grace, their skill, and the skill of many men survived the dangers encountered in their mission and returned to us safe and whole. We offer our humble thanksgiving for the successful recovery. Amen.
143:43:15|C|Reporter|Now for some additional picture taking. Might not only be professional photographers aboard but also a good many -
143:44:34|C|Reporter|Down into the sick bay, medical facility now for 3 hours of physical examinations. Now they're on the elevator there now. Joking about those beards. Jim Lovell seemed to be having some fun there with his beard. A momentary wait on the elevator here while the photographers get a few more pictures. This is an elaborate medical facility the Iwo Jima has onboard. And, as we said, there will be nine doctors down there awaiting Jim Lovell, John Swigert and Fred Haise. That's 3 doctors to an astronaut. And the first two blood samples, the findings medically speaking will be flown off as soon as possible, to the laboratories. I've been getting a look from the hangar deck of the elevator, whose down from top side. The elevator they use of course to transport the helicopters from hangar deck to flight deck. Once they get down they'll have a fairly shot walk, maybe 30 or 40 yards over into the - an opening leading up the medical facility. Sick bay, which may be a misnomer in this case. It does not appear anybody is sick. That's Captain Kirkemo - I know that is. And of course there will be some fast telephone calls we assume to some waiting wives at home. I wouldn't be surprised to see those phones ringing very shortly. There they go. Into the entrance of the medical facility and that should be all we see of them now for the next 3 hours or so, and possibly get an early medical report on what their conditions indeed are. But - the Apollo 13 men home safely aboard the carrier Iwo Jima out here; a perfect recovery; it couldn't have been better - it couldn't  -
143:49:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston, in the Mission Operations Control Room; there must be almost 200 people at this point and it appears as though everybody is talking, shaking hands, the cigars have been passed out -
143:49:38|C|Iwo Jima|... not quite where I wanted it. We are prepared to come back on, he is now on his way down here now. I have here with me right now Commander Spiuey. I'm prepared to put Commander Spiuey on the air with O'Brien as soon as he gets here in a couple of minutes. I would - we appreciate - ... talk about the recovery.
143:50:45|P|PAO|The plaque for Apollo 13 has just been placed on the wall in the Mission Control Room; that brought about this loud applause we just heard.
143:51:42|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston; we expect to have 3 news conferences picking up shortly in the Bldg. 1 auditorium, the first starting in aproximately 30 minutes with NASA Administrator Thomas Paine and Deputy Administrator George Low, this will be followed approximately 30 minutes later involving Dale Myers, Associate Administrator for Manned Spaceflight, and Dr. Gilruth, Robert Gillruth, Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center, Mr. Rocco Petrone, Apollo Program Director, Jim McDivitt, Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, and Mr. Chris Kraft, Deputy Director at MSC. Following that will be a third news conference with Mission Director Chet Lee, Director of Flight Operations, Sig Sjoberg, and Lead Flight Director for this mission, Milt Windler, and Mr. Ozzie [Ozro] Covington, of the Goddard Space Flight Center. We copied splashdown at 142 hours, 54 minutes, 44 seconds from liftoff, and this is Apollo Control, Houston, signing off at this time.
