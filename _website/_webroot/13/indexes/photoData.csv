0000050|KSC-69PC-413|ap11-KSC-69PC-413HR.jpg||Apollo 11 as viewed from an Air Force EC-135N plane. Journal Contributor James Hill notes that the bottom of the first stage seems to be engulfed in the hot exhaust. Journal Contributor Paul Fjeld writes, "It's called 'plume recirculation.' Because the F-1 nozzles are underexpanded for that altitude, a very small bit of the escaping burn mass actually goes forward from the lip of the nozzle. Because there are neighbor nozzles doing the same thing there is even more pinging 'upwards.' Couple that with a suction behind the detached part of the supersonic shock wave forming on the side of the S1-C stage and you get that dirty fire creeping up the rocket. It was expected and protected against. You can see the same phenomenon on shuttle launches just before the solids kick off - it looks like the bottom of the External Tank is on fire!" 16 July 1969.

I was stationed at console BE-17 with call sign C2HU. This was the SII LH Propellant Tanking Computer System, the controller that kept the LH level at the correct Flight Mass specified for the mission. It simply monitored the level through a capacitance probe and added LH as the LH evaporated following the filling by the Propellants section and through pressurization, after which there was no boil off. Our section was an Elec section working alongside the Mechs who managed the tank farms and overall propellant handling. Unfortunately, I cannot recognize any of the people from row BE." Deke Slayton, in a dark shirt with no tie, is six from the right in the second row, and Alan Shepard is next but one to Slayton's right. Kipp Teague notes that the clocks on the wall show Local (time) 10:25, Projected Launch (time) 9:32, and Accumulated Hold 12:00 (meaning 'none'. "As evidenced by the clocks, the photo was taken 53 minutes after liftoff." 16 July 1969. Scan by Kipp Teague.

The sequence of images indicate that 6549 has to have been taken before separation from the LM, which happened on Rev 12. Journal Contributor Scott Cruickshank notes that, using Celestia, the position of Australia indicates that 6549 was taken soon after AOS on Rev 6, which occurred at about 04:03 UTC on 20 July 1969. As seen from the Moon, the angular diameter of Earth is about 1.9 degrees. Between the times that 6547 and 6549 are taken, the Earth rises about 0.37 diameters or about 0.7 degrees and, with an orbital period of two hours, the interval between 6547 and 6549 can be estimated as 14 seconds. 20 July 1969.

1110001|AS11-45-6713|AS11-45-6713.jpg||Surface of a large piece of basalt. Note the large zap pit above center near the righthand edge. This boulder is probably the one Neil examined just as he was going out of the TV field-of-view to the right. After he finished examining this boulder, Neil left the ALSCC upright on the boulder surface while he deployed the LRRR and took Hasselblad documentation, as can be seen in <a href="#5952" target="new">AS11-40-5952</a>. The boulder is about 3 meters ENE of the LRRR. Red-blue anaglyph created by Erwin D'Hoore.

1955610|NS-ha-054||https://apollomedia.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/photos/ha-054.jpg|After donning their BIG suits, the astronauts opened the hatch and exited the CM with the help of the UDT decon swimmer. As seen in the photo,Neil Armstrongcame out first and half slid into the raft. The BIG suits did not have a grippy sole for the foot and the flotation collar was slick with salt water. Michael Collins came out next and then "Buzz" Aldrin. Two other issues that slowed the process were the BIG face visors fogging over in the tropic humidity and having to wear bulky "water wing" life vests.
1955614|NS-ha-047||https://apollomedia.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/photos/ha-047.jpg|President Nixon spent 15 minutes on the Flag Bridge, candidly chatting with members of the media and various ship's crewmen, thoroughly enjoying the moment. At 0544, the sonic boom of the spacecraft dropping below the sound barrier alerted the ship to its impending arrival. The president watched the following astronaut recovery activities from this spot.
1955704|NS-ha-052||https://apollomedia.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/photos/ha-052.jpg|OnceColumbiawas upright, UDT Swim Team 2 deployed from theirSea Kinghelicopter. They attached a sea anchor to slow the drift rate of the CM, and a flotation collar to stabilize the rocking spacecraft and two rafts to be used as work places. The lead swimmer then signaled to start the decontamination process. Helicopter #66 (SH-3DSea King, BuNo 152711) dipped low near the water to allow the decontamination swimmer LTJG Clancy Hatleberg to jump from the cargo hatch. On the next pass, the helicopter lowered the decontamination equipment to a work raft, including 4 biological isolation garments (BIGs) and two canisters of decontaminate solution.

1961819|NS-ha-062||https://apollomedia.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/photos/ha-062.jpg|Once the UDT swimmer finished decontaminating the three astronauts, the pilot of recovery helicopter #66, CDR Donald Jones, hovered over the decontamination raft and lowered down a standard Navy Billy Pugh rescue net. The astronauts were hoisted up one at a time, then NASA flight surgeon Dr. William Carpentier gave them a quick health check to ensure the quarantine process had not been compromised.
